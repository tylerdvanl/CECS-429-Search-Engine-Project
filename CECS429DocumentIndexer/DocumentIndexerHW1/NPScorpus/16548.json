NPS\/Neal Herbert       There’s no place like Yellowstone, and we need your help to protect it. Take the Yellowstone Pledge and join the growing number of people who treasure this national park and the role it plays in their lives. To show my support for the National Park Service mission to preserve unimpaired the natural and cultural resources of Yellowstone for my and future generations, I pledge to:  Respect wildlife: never approach or chase animals in order to take their picture. Stay on boardwalks in thermal areas. Protect thermal features by not throwing things into them.  Drive responsibly by observing posted speed limits and pulling over to let other cars pass. Park in designated areas and make sure my car never blocks traffic. Stay with my car if I’m stuck in a wildlife jam. Follow best practices for traveling safely in bear country: carry bear spray, be alert, make noise, travel in groups, do not run. Keep my food away from animals, and dispose of garbage in bear-proof cans. Be a steward: report resource violations by calling 911 or talking with a park ranger.  Encourage others to take this pledge!  Once you’ve taken the pledge, let us (and your friends) know with #YellowstonePledge on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram!",
