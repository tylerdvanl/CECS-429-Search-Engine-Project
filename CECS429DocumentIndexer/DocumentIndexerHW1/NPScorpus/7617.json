With that in mind the staff here has been working with various institutions and agencies to bring the story of what happened here to everyone who visits. The park has audio description for all of our exhibits. Our 3-D map is designed to be touched and has a brail legend and brail features on the map. Our exhibits are fully wheelchair accessible as our restrooms. Our film has close captioning.   If you need to barrow a wheelchair, we have one for you. Our viewing deck is accessible and it has one lowered viewing scope for those that would need one. The park even has someone on staff that knows sign language.
