Often, lizards will be heard and not seen as they scurry through the vegetation off the side of a trail, though ones that are sighted are often fast and hide easily. The largest lizards in the park are the Collared (Crotaphytus) and Leopard (Gambelia) lizards which can measure over a foot in total length. Both eat other lizards, insects, spiders, and small snakes. The largest Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum) ever recorded was found in Big Bend National Park. Texas horned lizards are not abundant in the park, and in the few places where they are located, they are not found in large numbers. However, there is no evidence yet, that suggests this is abnormal. It is more likely that Big Bend National Park doesn't have enough of the proper type of habitat necessary for these lizards. The main, and often only food for the Texas horned lizard is the harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex) which feeds mostly on grass seed. It is possible, if at one time there were larger grasslands in the Big Bend, there may have been a larger harvester ant population and thus a greater number of Texas horned lizards.",
