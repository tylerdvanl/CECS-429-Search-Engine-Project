NPS  A sub-bottom acoustic profiling sled was towed behind the research vessel to map the thickness of moss sediments around Wizard Island.         Moss, collected from Crater Lake, is examined aboard the boat. NPS  Green moss surrounds Wizard Island from approximately 26 meters (85 feet) to 140 meters (460 feet) depth.        Maps of moss sediments and sampling around Wizard Island. U.S. Geological Survey  When living moss dies it forms peat sediments. The peat sediments are located under presently growing moss and can be 10 meters (30 feet) thick in some places!",
