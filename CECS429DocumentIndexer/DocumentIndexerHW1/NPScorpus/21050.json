    "body": "Cooperating Association          Eastern National EASTERN NATIONAL promotes the public's understanding and support of America's national parks and other public trusts. Eastern National, chartered in 1948, is a sound basis for educational and park management activities. Our publications program has produced an array of distinguished and informative books and hundreds of folders, many distributed free of charge. We have underwritten production of many fine audiovisual programs used in the parks and in homes and schools. As the needs of our primary partner the National Park Service-have changed, we have been asked to become involved in many interpretive and revenue generating programs to further support its needs. Eastern National welcomes the cooperation of all those interested in helping the National Park Service and its programs. Please contact us to discuss our programs, employment opportunities, and tax deductible donations and bequests.  Click Here For More Information",
