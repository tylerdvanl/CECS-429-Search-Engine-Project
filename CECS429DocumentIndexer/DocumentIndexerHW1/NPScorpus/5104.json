Historians and archeologists were summoned to identify, record, and salvage data before the valley was inundated. Archeologists began their surveys in 1959, and by the mid 1960s, recognized that this area offered a rich and well preserved record of prehistoric occupation, beginning with the Paleo-Indian, the earliest known culture in the New World.        Dr. Herbert Kraft   Archeologist Herbert Kraft (STG: 2001 Vol. 23 No. 1) Dr. Herbert Kraft, Professor Emeritus and curator of the Museum of Archeology at Seton Hall University, died on October 31, 2000. He devoted 50 years to the academic study of the prehistory of the Delaware River Valley and was an acknowledged authority on the Lenape\/Delaware people. Author David Orr recalls memories of Herb Kraft as a mentor and peer.          Sifting soil on a dig site   Archeology in the Minisink Today (STG: 2003 Vol. 25 No. 2) John R. Wright investigates how the search for the past intrigues the very essence of all of us, whether it is our own family genealogy, or the mere interest in what occurred before us.

Wright and Lori Rohrer detail how the National Park Service is often caught between the proverbial rock, preservation laws or regulations, and the hard place, the park's enabling legislation. How do the cultural resource managers balance the legal requirements of confidentiality, conservation, and preservation and still respond to, and encourage, the public's interest?        Pipe installation for an aqueduct   An entire issue of Cultural Resources Magazine, Dam Good Archeology Vol. 23 No. 1 2000  was dedicated to the Cultural Resources Program of the Bureau of Reclamation.The Bureau is best known for the dams,reservoirs, powerplants, and canals it constructed in the 17 western states over the past nine decades, as it attempted to accomplish its mandate to reclaim the arid west. These early construction projects were not accomplished without impacts to cultural resources. It continues to advance progressive solutions to cultural resource issues through involvement in public outreach programs.        ARPA Archeological Resources Protection Act 1979 (16USC 470aa-mm)  Minisink Archeological Site | National Park Service Archeology Program",
