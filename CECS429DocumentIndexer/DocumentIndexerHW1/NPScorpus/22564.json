The identity and cause of death of these 13 Confederate soldiers remain a mystery.        Three of the six visible (eight total) mounds at the Pharr Mounds site.  Photo by Marc Muench  If you were at milepost 286.7 about 2000 years ago, you may have seen a busy village full of people. The Pharr Mounds Site contains eight mounds that vary from two feet to 18 feet high, and represent the lives of people from the Middle Woodland period. Interpretive waysides explain the mound building process and life in the village.        Today there is a bridge over the Tennessee River, but in the early 1800's George Colbert operated a ferry across the river. Photo by Marc Muench  Today a bridge takes you across the Tennessee River, but at milepost 327.3 George Colbert operated a stand and ferry at this spot in the early 1800's. Colbert Ferry is a great place to enjoy a picnic by the river, or to use the boat launch for fishing and boating on the Tennessee River.        The stepping stones at the Rock Spring Nature Trail take visitors to views of Colbert Creek. NPS Photo  The Rock Spring Nature Trail at milepost 330.2 is a short half mile loop trail that takes you past Colbert Creek and away from the traffic of the parkway.
