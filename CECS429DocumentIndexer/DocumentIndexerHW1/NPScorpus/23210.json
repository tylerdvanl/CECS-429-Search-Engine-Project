    "body": "Research       Research about El Camino Real events and routes is ongoing. The National Park Service (NPS) works cooperatively with scholars, site managers, and others to learn more about trail-related stories and sites. A primary way in which the NPS stimulates trail scholarship is through the Challenge Cost Share Program. Since 2004, the agency has worked with a number of partners — El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro Trail Association, universities, museums, historical societies, and other nonprofit entities — on El Camino Real projects. Many of the results of those projects have been published in various issues of CARTA, El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro Trail Association's newsletter. Through these projects, new historical trail information has been discovered; new or modified trail segments have been identified; several buildings have been identified as being thematically-related to El Camino Real; several outdoor interpretive exhibits have been erected; and new museum exhibits have been developed and are now on display.  If you have a project idea that can add new historical information or challenge existing notions about the trail, contact the National Trails Intermountain Region staff.
