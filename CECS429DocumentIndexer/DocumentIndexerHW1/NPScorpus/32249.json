    "body": "Chapter Seven: Relationship with Other Organizations       Whitman Mission does not exist as an entity unto itself. Instead, the park is dependent upon other agencies and groups for direction and support. Whitman Mission commonly associates with, and is dependent upon, the Federal government, the local community, and its neighbors. The quality of these relationships indicates how Whitman Mission is perceived and oftentimes indicates future direction. Ultimately the quality of a relationship affects park operations. This chapter examines Whitman Mission's relationships beginning with the most apparent and important: the Federal government.",
