The abundance of birds in Denali ebbs and flows across the seasons, increasing significantly as migrants return to Denali in spring and decreasing when they depart on their autumn migration. Summer birding in Denali rewards visitors with opportunities to view these migratory species in this spectacular northern environment. Birding in winter is slim by the numbers, but high in rewards as observations of pine grosbeaks, mixed flocks of ptarmigan, and perhaps a gyrfalcon or northern goshawk awaits the hardy winter birder.   Explore the sections below to learn more about Denali’s birds and current research projects happening in the park.               Birding in Denali   Over 160 bird species call Denali home.
