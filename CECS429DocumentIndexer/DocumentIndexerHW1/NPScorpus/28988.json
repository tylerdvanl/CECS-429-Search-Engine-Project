    "body": "Laws & Policies       Sagamore Hill was opened to the public as a museum in 1953, under the auspices of the Theodore Roosevelt Association. It was privately run for about ten years before the entire property, along with the Roosevelt birthplace in Manhattan, was gifted to the federal government. Legislation establishing Sagamore Hill National Historic Site passed Congress and was signed by President Kennedy in July 1962. To read the Act click here. All federal laws pertaining to Parks, Forests and Public Property contained in Chapter I of Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations are enforced at Sagamore Hill NHS. In addition, 36 CFR grants park superintendents the right to make park-specific regulations to maintain public health and safety, protect environmental or scenic values, protect natural and cultural resources, aid in scientific research, provide for equitable use of facilities, and avoid conflict among visitor use activities. These park-specific regulations are found in the Superintendent's Compendium. Sagamore Hill NHS also operates under policies developed by the NPS Director, found here.  Firearms in National Parks The law governing possession of firearms inside a national park changed on February 22, 2010. Visitors may possess firearms within a national park unit provided they comply with federal, state, and local laws. The role of the responsible gun owner is to know and obey the federal, state, and local laws appropriate to the park they are visiting. Please remember that federal law prohibits firearms in certain park facilities and buildings. These places are marked with signs at public entrances. For more information Please read this document.  State hunting laws do not apply at Sagamore Hill NHS and all forms of hunting (as well as target practice, etc.) are prohibited by federal regulations.",
