Enjoy the wildflowers, but don’t pick them. NPS\/Herbert       Wildflowers such as lupine and arnica often grow under the forest canopy, but the most conspicuous wildflower displays occur in open meadows and sagebrush-steppe. The appearance of beauties, glacier lilies, and steer’s head announce spring in the park. Soon colors splash the slopes, especially on the northern range—yellow from arrowleaf balsamroot, white from phlox, reds and oranges from paintbrush, and blue from penstemon and lupine. Goldenrod and asters indicate the coming of autumn. (View Yellowstone's Wildflower List with Blooming Times)  The Yellowstone is a wild-flower garden. Wander where you will, you have the ever-new charm, the finishing touch, the ever-refreshing radiance of the wild flowers. — Enos Mills, Your National Parks, 1917       Finding Flowers Elevation, relative temperatures, soil types, and precipitation patterns all play a role in what you find blooming in various areas at different times of the year. In addition, far-reaching events such as fires can cause spectacular blooms of species that thrive on the conditions these events create. Remember that many of Yellowstone’s wildflowers are also very important parts of animal diets. The bulbs of spring beauty and glacier lily, for example, are vital spring foods of the grizzly bear. Wild strawberries are collected by ground squirrels and chipmunks; the seeds of most wildflowers are used by birds and insects. Even the petals of many flowers are eaten by animals. Bees and other insects collect nectar and pollen. Exotic Species Exotic plants —escaped domestics and “weeds”—can be found in Yellowstone. Look for them in disturbed sites such as roadsides where they have little initial competition. Dalmation toadflax, yellow sweetclover, ox-eye daisy, and other exotics compete unnaturally with native plants. For this reason, and for the continued integrity of the Yellowstone ecosystem, these exotics are controlled.      What's Blooming Now We occasionally post recent sightings of wildflower blooms here and on Yellowstone's Facebook page.      April 18, 2016 Update Natives on the Yellowstone River Trail or Lava Creek Trail  Shooting star (Dodecatheon conjugens)  Sagebrush buttercup (Ranunculus glaberrimus)  Jove's buttercup (Ranunculus jovis)  Leafy musineon (Musineon divaricatum)  Kittentails (Besseya wyomingensis)  Woollypod milk-vetch (Astragalus purshii)  Hood's phlox (Phlox hoodii)   Nonnatives on the Yellowstone River Trail or Lava Creek Trail  Honrseed buttercup (Ranunculus testiculatus)  Desert alyssum (Alyssum desertorum)   Around the Heritage and Research Center  Alyssum alyssoides (Pale alyssum) in the Brassicaceae, exotic.

NPS         Twinpod (Physaria acutifolia) on the Mammoth Hot Springs terraces. NPS\/Voight  Twinpod (Physaria acutifolia) is blooming on the Mammoth Hot Springs terraces, as of May 21, 2015. We have a couple of other species of bladderpods in the park. It is hard to tell them apart, but if you are on the terraces, you are probably seeing Physaria acutifolia. If you are on the northern range, tou might see the yellow blooms of common twinpod (Physaria didymocarpa var. didymocarpa).         More Information  Vegetation Communities Map Vegetation References Vegetation and Resource Management Program",
