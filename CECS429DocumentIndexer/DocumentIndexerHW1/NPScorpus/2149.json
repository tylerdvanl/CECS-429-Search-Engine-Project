    "body": "Explore This Park    Get Involved           Get Involved       There are so many different ways you can get involved with your parks. Here at Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site: We are working with the Arizona NPS Centennial office to come up with programs to celebrate National Park Service's 100th anniversary. You can volunteer your services to our interpretation, farm, maintenance, and curatorial programs. In order for anyone to do on-site business, such as commercial photography, you will need a Special Park Use permit. Please make sure that all necessary forms are filled out and returned to the Coordinator. Over the past 50 years in existence, Hubbell Trading Post NHS has developed planning documents and you can read these at your leisure. Visitors and friends like yourself can now support your park directly. Please read on and learn more about the fantastic way to help this national treasure.",
