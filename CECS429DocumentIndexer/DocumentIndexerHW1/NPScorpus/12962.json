On their routine patrols through the high country of Yosemite, these Buffalo Soldiers recorded the pertinent but mundane details of their journeys in ledgers that were housed in the remote patrol posts that served as both the beginning and end of long days spent in the saddle. Certainly they must have entertained thoughts more provocative than \"encountered 500 head of sheep in Return Canyon. Brand \"P,\" which mirrors the sort of entry you can find in the historic patrol reports! This podcast is an exploration of those thoughts via the imagination of Ranger Johnson, but based on years of historic research of what a particular Buffalo Soldier by the name of Elizy Boman, a man who did exist but of whom we know practically nothing about, might have been feeling or thinking after one of those long, arduous, but inspiring patrols through the \"Range of Light.\" Subscribe to this podcast on iTunes.               Time In Yosemite     Sgt. Boman talks about Time as its own sort of geography, that in the Sierra Nevada you can get lost in the when, the here and now, as easily as taking a wrong turn in the mountains.
