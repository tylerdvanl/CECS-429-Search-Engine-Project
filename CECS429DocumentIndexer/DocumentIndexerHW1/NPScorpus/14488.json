Born in 1812 or 1813 while the Lincoln family was living at the Knob Creek Farm north of Hodgen's Mill (present-day Hodgenville, Kentucky), Thomas (Tommy) was named for his father. Most historical accounts state that Thomas Jr. soon became ill and died while still in infancy. Dennis Hanks, a cousin of Nancy Hanks Lincoln, the mother of Thomas Jr., later recalled that little Tommy Lincoln \"did not live three days.\" Whereas Thomas Lincoln did not own the land he farmed at Knob Creek he could not bury Thomas Jr. on the property. Thomas Lincoln Jr. was buried in the Redmon Cemetery on a nearby hill overlooking the Lincoln's Knob Creek Farm. The illness that Thomas Lincoln Jr. died from is not known.",
