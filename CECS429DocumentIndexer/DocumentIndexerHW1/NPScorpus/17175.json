It is a park of recreation fields, marshes, magnolia bogs, and landscaping.  No where is this more obvious than at the northern end of the park. Like a time capsule from the past, one finds remnants of Washington's nature legacy here.  Marsh plants that fed local civilizations for thousands of years survive, mink skitter on the islands in winter, and colorful summer butterflies fill the sun light and shadow with beauty.  By preserving a part of the flood plain of the Anacostia River, Congress authorized a park that serves the public by filtering water, reducing flood damage, and preserving the biological and cultural resources that let us see from the past into the future.               Nght herons visit the park for a snack.  Other birds are seen through the year.
