Tickets and transportation for all three sites can be accessed at the Pearl Harbor Visitor Center.  You can also make reservations online for the Passport to Pearl Harbor, which includes the USS Arizona Memorial narrated tour, and admission to the USS Bowfin Submarine Museum & Park, the Battleship Missouri Memorial, and the Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor.           Battleship Missouri Memorial The Battleship Missouri, also known as \"Mighty Mo\" or \"Big Mo,\" is a US Navy battleship named in honor of the state of Missouri. The USS Missouri was the last battleship commissioned by the United States and was the site of the Japanese surrender on Sept 2, 1945, marking the end of WWII. The Battleship Missouri Memorial offers two daily tours, as well as much more to explore at your own pace!         USS Bowfin Submarine Museum & Park USS Bowfin (SS-287) is a fleet attack submarine that fought in the Pacific during WWII and helped to make famous the term, \"Silent Service.\" Bowfin was launched on Dec. 7, 1942, exactly one year to the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. She was nicknamed the Pearl Harbor Avenger, so it is fitting that she is permanently homeported at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.         Pacific Aviation Museum   The Pacific Aviation Museum hosts a variety of aviation exhibits, most directly relating to the Pearl Harbor attack on Dec 7, 1941, and to World War II. The museum, located on Ford Island, occupies two hangars and the Ford Island Control Tower that still bear the scars of our nation's aviation battlefield.        Historic Sites on Oahu Just a short drive from the Pearl Harbor Visitor Center, here are other sites to visit on the island.          Diamond Head   Diamond Head is a crater formed about 300,000 years ago during a single, explosive volcanic eruption. Today, Diamond Head (Lē'ahi in Hawaiian) sits on the eastern edge of Waikiki's coastline and is known for its historic hiking, stunning views, and military history.           Bishop Museum Bishop Museum is a history and science museum located in Honolulu's historic Kalihi district. This museum houses the world's largest collection of Polynesian cultural artifacts. It was built in 1889 by Charles Bishop in memory of his late wife, Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop.         National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, Punchbowl   The National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, Punchbowl, is a national cemetery located at Punchbowl Crater in Honolulu.
