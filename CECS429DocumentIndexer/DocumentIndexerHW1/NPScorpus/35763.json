    "body": "Paroling the Army of Northern Virginia         Parole Pass of Corporal Lewis McDonald   The terms of the surrender allowed Confederate soldiers to be paroled and return home, instead of prison. It was not until the April 10 meeting between Grant and Lee that  it was agreed each Confederate would be provided with an individual parole pass certifying that the men would not take up  arms against the United States. Per Grant's instructions these passes could aid the former Confederates during their journey home, allowing them to use federal transportation (ships and trains where available) or to draw food and supplies from federally controlled stations in the South. Approximately 30,000 blank passes were printed at the Clover Hill Tavern. After the Confederates surrendered their military equipment, they were eligible to receive the pass. Some higher ranking Confederates were paroled by Federal officers, but most passes were signed by Confederate officers for the men in their commands. Attached is an alphabetical listing of soldiers that were paroled at Appomattox Court House. If you have questions regarding the parole listings, please contact us.",
