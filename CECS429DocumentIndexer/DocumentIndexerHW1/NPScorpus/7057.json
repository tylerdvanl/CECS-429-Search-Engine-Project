    "body": "Bicycling       All roads in Theodore Roosevelt National Park are open to biking. The park roads follow the contours of the badlands, allowing riders to fully experience the scenery. Off-road cycling is not allowed in the park. Hiking trails are closed to bicycling.  All bicycles must remain on paved or dirt roads.   Bikers should exercise caution as they ride in the park; they will share the narrow roads with large RVs and other vehicles. Vehicle traffic is heaviest in June, July, August, and September. Road shoulders are absent in some places. Bicyclists must obey all traffic laws. Use caution around bison and other wildlife. Special note on the Maah Daah Hey Trail: Although bicycling is allowed on the Maah Daah Hey Trail elsewhere, bicycles are not permitted on the trail as it passes through both the North and South Units of the park. Bicycles cannot be carried or walked over the trail; they must go around the park. The Buffalo Gap Trail is an alternate route that bypasses the South Unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park. Users of the trail near the North Unit must use existing roads to bypass the park.",
