    "body": "Weather         Scott Campbell  When we think of weather in the Midwest region of the United States, images of tornadoes and thunderstorms might come to mind. These powerful meteorological phenomena haunt our thoughts and remind us of little structures being lifted high into the sky like Dorothy’s fictional farmhouse in \"The Wizard of OZ\".  Yet between these violent outbursts, a much milder climatic ebb and flow exists. In the winter months of Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve, temperatures can range from 60+ degrees Fahrenheit in the daytime and drop to well below freezing at night. Snowstorms come and go yet only occasionally leave accumulations.  Prairie weather has a desert-like personality of opposing extremes. Wildlife and prairie flora have become accustomed to these harsh changes. It may come as a surprise to learn that several species of cacti and reptile normally associated with desert climates thrive in this unique tallgrass prairie landscape.  Please visit the links below to see the current weather forecast at the preserve. Also, it is a good idea to check these links before hiking into the prairie, as storms can produce severe weather and the prairie does not offer much protection against hail or lightning.
