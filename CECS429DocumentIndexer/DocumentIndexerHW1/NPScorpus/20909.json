Our answer is a definite yes!  Our experience is that children enjoy the Rock but that they often find different aspects of an Alcatraz visit interesting - for example the ferry ride on San Francisco Bay, the abundance of flowers and birds that inhabit the island, the views of the surrounding towns, islands, and bridges, and the steep hill on the island. There is no reason to hesitate bringing children to the Rock.",
