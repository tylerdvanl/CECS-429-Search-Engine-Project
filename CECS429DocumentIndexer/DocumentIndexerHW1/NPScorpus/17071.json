    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Directions & Transportation             Directions       Castle Mountains National Monument and adjacent Mojave National Preserve lies within a few hours' drive of several major metropolitan areas. Castle Mountains can only be accessed by dirt roads. A high clearance, four-wheel drive vehicle is recommended.      Do not rely on GPS directions to navigate to or within Castle Mountains National Monument! GPS maps aren't always up to date, especially for remote areas. Travelers to the area should carry up-to-date road maps to verify the accuracy of GPS directions if used. Use common sense before heading down a primitive dirt road in the desert.     You can approach Castle Mountains from Walking Box Ranch Road off of Nevada State Rd 164 (Nipton Road) or from several unnamed dirt roads off of Lanfair Road in Mojave National Preserve.    The closest airport is in Las Vegas, Nevada.    There is no public transportation to the park.",
