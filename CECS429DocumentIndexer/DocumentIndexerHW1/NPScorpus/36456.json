Over 100 miles of paved roads and 160 miles of backcountry dirt roads provide challenges for riders of all types and abilities. Bicyclists must be extremely cautious and well-prepared, but bicycling allows outstanding panoramic views unobstructed by a windshield. It also allows the bicyclist to see and hear some of the smaller wonders of Big Bend from a more intimate viewpoint.Bicycling is allowed on any road within Big Bend National Park, but is not allowed off-road or on any trail. SafetyBicyclists must share the roads with vehicles and obey all traffic laws. Paved roads within the park are narrow and often have no shoulders. Bicyclists should take proper measures to stay safe, such as riding single-file, wearing bright and\/or reflective clothing, and being away of their surroundings.Traffic is sparse in summer and highest during March and early April and on holiday weekends throughout the year. Use extreme caution. A good map is essential. Maps and road guides are available at the Big Bend Natural History Association Book Store.WeatherWeather is often pleasant year-round and rewarding trips are possible most days of the year.
