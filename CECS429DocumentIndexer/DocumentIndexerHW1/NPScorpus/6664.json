Lands along the river remain in private ownership, except for Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge (landing, etc.), Smith Falls State Park (landing, camping, etc.) and Brewer Bridge Landing. Local businesses provide watercraft rental, shuttle, campground, and lodging services and provide river access at other landings along the river. To make reservations, contact the business of your choice from this List of River Outfitters.    If you have your own equipment and transportation, you may use any of the three public landings without going through an outfitter.    If you'd rather keep your feet dry, explore the public land at Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge and Smith Falls State Park. Both have beautiful views of the river, short hiking trails, and seasonal visitor centers.
