The vegetation is divided into three major plant associations:  the moderately dense mixed-grass prairie, the ponderosa pine\/Rocky Mountain juniper\/eastern red cedar forests, and the hardwood association along the floodplain of the North Platte River  Within these plant associations can be further found seven major habitat types: riverine woodland, coniferous woodland, mixed-grass prairie, riparian habitat associated with irrigation canals, pine-studded bluffs, shrub-dominated slopes, and badlands. In 1995 twenty vegetation \"mapping classes\" were identified within the boundaries of the Monument in accordance with the Federal Geographic Data Committee's National Vegetation Classification Standard. A vegetation map was produced from this research. The mixed-grass prairie is the predominant vegetative cover of the Monument.",
