The park established a seasonal shuttle system to eliminate traffic and parking problems. However, during high visitation there are long lines at the entrance gates and limited parking inside the park.   During non-shuttle season, Zion still experiences crowding. The Zion Canyon Scenic Drive will close to traffic once all legal parking spaces are full to ensure that emergency vehicles are able to access trailheads and visitors experiencing an emergency. Be prepared with an alternate plan during early March and November.  Where the Crowds Are  From March through October, visitation at Zion is extremely high. There may be significant delays entering the park, and once inside there is limited parking. Parking is usually full by 10 am. The best way to avoid delays entering Zion is to park in Springdale and ride the free shuttle to the park.   The Zion Canyon Visitor Center is also very busy with lines that regularly stretch to the visitor center doors. You can avoid long lines at the visitor center by planning your trip ahead and downloading the current Map and Guide.   There are other places to explore in the park that are not as busy as Zion Canyon, such as Kolob Canyons, the Kolob Terrace Road, and the east side of the park.   If you do visit during peak season, expect to see a lot of other people on the trails and shuttle. It is not uncommon for hundreds of people to hike to Angels Landing or The Narrows. The following holidays and weekends are especially busy:   1. Memorial Day (last Monday in May) 2. Easter week (date varies - usually in April) 3. Labor Day (first Monday in September)  4. Utah Education Association break (4 days in October, visit www.myuea.org for details)   When parking lots are full, please remember:    Park in designated areas only.  If a lot is full, do not wait for spots to open;move on and try again later.  Never park on vegetation or in a manner that blocks traffic.  Don't block the flow of traffic by waiting for a parking spot.              How to Avoid the Crowds     Avoid visiting on the holidays\/weekends listed above. Park in Springdale and ride the free shuttle to the park and enter though the pedestrian entrance.  Consider visiting during the off season when temperatures are cool and visitation is lower.  Visit less crowded areas of the park. Avoid long lines at visitor centers by planning your trip ahead and download the Map and Guide.  Riding your bicycle on the Zion Canyon Scenic Drive is a enjoyable option.",
