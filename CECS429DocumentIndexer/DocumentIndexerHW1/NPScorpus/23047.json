See the following definitions and examples to determine if your usage might be included.    A special park use is defined as a short-term activity that takes place in a park area, and that:     provides a benefit to an individual, group, or organization rather than the public at large; requires written authorization and some degree of management control from the National Park Service (NPS) in order to protect park resources and the public interest; is not prohibited by law or regulation; is not initiated, sponsored, or conducted by the NPS; and is not managed under a concession contract, a recreation activity for which the NPS charges a fee, or a lease.  Examples include: weddings, other ceremonies or public assemblies, events sponsored by an organization for which we act as the venue, etc.    Examples of First-Amendment Activities include: a church service, political event, or Freedom-of-Speech act.   For more information regarding Special Use Permits or to determine if your activity requires one, please call (575) 479-6124 ext. 206 and ask to speak with the Special Park Use Coordinator.   Applications for permits should be submitted well in advance, preferably 2-3 months before the event to allow for consideration and processing.
