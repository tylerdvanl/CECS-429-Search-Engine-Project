NPS Photo\/Paul Stolen  The Kobuk River winds its way slowly through the park for 61 miles. In that stretch of water, depending on the time of year, visitors can see sheefish, salmon, Dolly Varden, and grayling to list a few of the most popular. Check out our fish list for a more complete list of the fish found in Kobuk Valley National Park.   The Kobuk River and its tributaries are home to an abundance of fish. Sheefish, rare elsewhere, are abundant along the Kobuk River, and can grow as large as 60 pounds. Every summer, the chum salmon return from the ocean to their spawning grounds within the valley. They return vital nutrients to the river and bringing food to the people who live along its banks.",
