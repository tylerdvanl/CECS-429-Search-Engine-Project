NPS Photo   \"Civic engagement\" is a philosophy, discipline, and practice defined by the National Park Service as \"a continuous, dynamic conversation with the public on many levels that reinforces public commitment to the preservation of heritage resources.\" The Timucuan Preserve is currently reaching out to the public for their reactions to the recent discovery of a slave graveyard at Kingsley Plantation. The National Park Service has established guiding principles regarding such civic engagement. The five NPS strategies that guide civic engagement initiatives, including the Kingsley Initiative, are as follows:      · Be an effective collaborative leader by building a leadership approach for successfully collaborating with others and engaging with the public;  · Build NPS team capacity for engagement and collaboration through practices that enable successful relationships;  · Prepare in advance before launching an engagement process by investing the time in due diligence to understand the local context and history of park-community relationships;  · Build and maintain relationships through the application of proven practices of collaboration and civic engagement;  · Sustain the effort over time through practices that cultivate successful collaboration and partnerships.
