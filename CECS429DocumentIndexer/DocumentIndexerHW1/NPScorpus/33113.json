    "body": "Mystic Lake via Sunrise      Mystic Lake    Trail from Sunrise via the Wonderland Trail  Â    Mystic Lake via Sunrise   Distance, round trip: 21.8 miles Elevation gain, Sunrise to Mystic: 1900 feet Elevation gain, Mystic to Sunrise: 2700 feet Hiking time, round trip: 10 hours Wilderness Camps: Granite Creek Camp, Mystic Camp  Trail Description Trail from Sunrise via the Wonderland Trail. NOTE: Always check current trail conditions before heading out. Log footbridges frequently wash out during the winter or other conditions could be affecting the trail.  Along the Trail The trailhead starts at 6,400 feet elevation at Sunrise and climbs moderately a short distance to the top of Sourdough Ridge.   Views from here are mighty in all directions. Follow the Sourdough Ridge trail west to hook up with the Wonderland Trail. Take the Wonderland Trail to Skyscraper Pass, the second highest point on the Wonderland Trail.   The way descends to Granite Creek Camp, then to the snout of the Winthrop Glacier. Stop here in the old moraine of the glacier. From this location, you will get a good look at massive crevasse fields high up on the Winthrop Glacier.  The Wonderland Trail continues on and eventually enters a small forest where you will find Mystic Camp a short distance before you emerge into the beautiful meadows that surround Mystic Lake. This is flanked by Mineral Mountain to the south and Old Desolate to the north. The view of the mountains reflected in the lake, especially at sunrise and sunset, is a highlight of the hike. There is a ranger patrol cabin near the lake that is staffed by a ranger at times throughout the summer. Backpacking Permits are required for camping anywhere in the backcountry at Mount Rainier. They must be obtained before you enter the backcountry. Permits and current trail conditions are available park-wide at wilderness information centers, ranger stations, and visitor centers. Treat water before drinking. Fires are prohibited. No pets on trails.",
