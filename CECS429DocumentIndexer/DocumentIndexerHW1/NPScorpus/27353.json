The park offers housing opportunities at nearby Badlands National Park through RV hook-up spaces and an apartment for volunteers in the spring, fall and winter seasons. Volunteers are crucial in helping the park achieve its mission of providing interpretive and educational programs and services to our visitors.  Our VIP's (Volunteers-In-Parks) help conduct tours, provide historic interpretation at the missile silo and Delta-01, and answer questions at the visitor center about Minuteman Missiles and the Cold War. In addition, volunteers have assisted with administrative tasks, cataloging museum artifacts and completing maintenance projects.    Â     Current Volunteer Opportunities",
