    "body": "Donate       You can make a gift to benefit our park either directly or through our primary non profit organization. If you make the gift directly to the park, the entire gift will be used for the purpose you identify. Your check will be deposited in a government account and the full amount will be spent as you intended. Government accounts are non-interest bearing and cannot generate interest between the time it is deposited and the time it is spent. For security and other reasons, you cannot make on line contributions directly to the park or the National Park Service. However, you can stop in or mail a check to the parkâ€™s visitor center to make your donation.  You can make on line gifts through our primary park partner, Friends of Virgin Islands National Park.  Donations can be directed to the general need of the park, or to a specific program or project (i.e. trail maintenance or education program).",
