Cooperating associations assist the NPS by developing and printing educational and interpretive materials and items; procuring, distributing and selling educational materials in retail outlets within national parks; and providing funding for purchasing land and artifacts, medial for park libraries, period attire for living history demonstrations, and signage and exhibits. They also provide funding support for special events, park facility renovations and upgrade, interpretive tools and programs, staff training programs, and cultural and historical research. Eastern National is one of sixty-five cooperating associations nationwide that provide quality educational products and services to visitors to America's national parks. Currently, Eastern National is the cooperating association for over 150 NPS units and also partners with many other public agencies, including the U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and state and city park systems around the nation. Eastern National was founded by NPS rangers in 1947 at Gettysburg National Military Park. It was established to serve as a cooperating association that would serve a network of individual parks that would not sustain their own cooperating association. Since its incorporation in 1948, Eastern National has donated over $100 million in donations and grants to the NPS. Joining Eastern National supports your parks and gives you a 15% discount on merchandise in any Eastern National store. Here at Ninety Six National Historic Site Visitor Center, Eastern National manages the bookstore.
