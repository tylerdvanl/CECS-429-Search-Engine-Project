    "title": "Virgin Islands National Park: Mammals",
    "body": "Mammals       Dolphins swim in the waters around the Virgin Islands, and in the winter months, if you are lucky, you may catch a glimpse of whales migrating through the area.  Bats are the only land mammals native to Virgin Islands National Park. If you sit outdoors in a quiet place at dusk, you may see bats swooping through the air in pursuit of insects. Bats also pollinate flowers and spread seeds of fruit trees. One type of bat even consumes fish. There are six species of bats in the Virgin Islands. Nonnative mammals are common on St. John. Donkeys, goats, and mongoose were introduced by humans. You may meet some of these animals on the road or at the beach. Please remember that these are wild animals; do not feed or try to touch them.
