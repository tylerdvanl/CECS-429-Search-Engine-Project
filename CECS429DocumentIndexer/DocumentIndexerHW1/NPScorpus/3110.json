    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Safety            Safety        When exploring Pipe Spring National Monument, safety is your responsibility. Heat Exhaustion Temperatures in the high desert can swing widely. During the summer, expect hot weather and low humidity. Drink plenty of water if you plan to hike the Ridge Trail or attend a Winsor Castle tour. Snakes Pipe Spring is home to rattlesnakes. If you see or hear a rattlesnake on the trail, give it plenty of room and step back. Do not try to move or scare away the snake. Spring Water Do not drink from the spring. On a hot day, drinking from the troughs that lead to the retention ponds may look enticing, but the water is not potable. Livestock Keep hands and fingers away from the mouths and horns of the livestock. If you'd like to feed the horses, please ask a ranger for a treat: do not feed them on your own.  Firearms Firearms are permitted at Pipe Spring National Monument, but not in the visitor center or any of the historic structure. As of February 22, 2010, a new federal law allows people who can legally possess firearms under federal, Arizona, and local laws, to possess firearms in the park. It is the visitor's responsibility to understand and comply with all applicable Arizona local and federal firearm laws. The discharge, display, brandishing or any indiscriminate use of firearms (including hunting) within the park is strictly prohibited.",
