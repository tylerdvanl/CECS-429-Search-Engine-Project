In spring, it thunders; during the rest of the year, look for its characteristic light, swaying flow. A paved trail leads from the parking area to the base of this waterfall, which flows year-round. Although paved, this is trail is not wheelchair accessible due to its grade.  Seasonality The trail to Bridalveil Fall is open year-round. When the water is at its peak in spring and early summer, you can expect to get wet! In some cases the spray is so strong, you may not even be able to easily access the end of the trail. Expect icy and very slick conditions in winter.           Stay Safe  The rocks and boulders above the viewing platform are slippery even when dry; stay safe by staying on the paved trail. Scrambling off trail in this area has led to serious injuries.  If you choose to park along Southside Drive, when getting out of your vehicle, watch for traffic and be cautious opening car doors and crossing the road.  Water  Drinking water is not available at the trailhead, base of the waterfall, or parking area.  Restrooms  Restrooms are available in the parking area.  Parking Parking is available at the trailhead, accessible from the Wawona Road (continuation of Highway 41) or Southside Drive. The parking area often fills up quickly in summer and, while there is a lot of turnover, traffic jams are common when getting in and out of this parking lot. Another option is to drive a little further east on Southside Drive into Yosemite Valley (a few hundred yards), where you'll find parking on either side of the road with a different trail option. This trail is a bit longer—an additional 0.25 miles (0.4 km), crosses Bridalveil Creek, and showcases different views of Bridalveil Fall as you approach the main parking area.   Transportation  Shuttle service is not available to the Bridalveil Fall area. Drive your own car to the trailhead (or take a long hike using the Valley Loop Trail).  Trail Etiquette Leashed pets are allowed on this trail. Keep your food within arm's reach at all times and do not feed the wildlife. Carry out all trash and food waste (fruit peels, shells, etc.).
