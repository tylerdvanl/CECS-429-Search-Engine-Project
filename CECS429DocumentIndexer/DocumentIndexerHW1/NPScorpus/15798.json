Stormwater Pollution Protection Plan (SWPPP)   Water runoff resulting from storms can carry pollutants into rivers, lakes, and oceans that harm water quality. In order to ensure that construction activities associated with the Muir Woods Resource Protection Project do not negatively impact nearby water resources like Redwood Creek, the National Park Service (NPS) has worked with a stormwater consultant to develop and implement a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP). The State Water Resources Control Board is overseeing the SWPPP.    Click here for more information and how to access the SWPP.   Other Plans & Projects     Redwood Creek Watershed Assessment (PDF)   The remarkable natural resources of the Redwood Creek watershed have been recognized and valued for over a century. This roughly 9 square mile watershed, located in Marin County and less than an hour drive from downtown San Francisco, hosts the iconic ancient redwood grove at Muir Woods National Monument, which is nestled between slopes of Mount Tamalpais and Muir Beach. The watershed is an extremely popular sightseeing and recreational destination, receiving over 2.5 million visitors annually. Four federally listed animal species (coho salmon, steelhead, red-legged frog, and northern spotted owl), and several rare plants occupy the diverse habitats within the watershed.   Overall, this document is meant to serve as a common technical reference point for jurisdictions and stakeholders to provide specific guidance regarding agreed-on priority issues and potential actions to address those issues, and most importantly to facilitate joint and\/or coordinated efforts to improve the health and collective management of the Redwood Creek watershed.   Redwood Creek Watershed Vision for the Future - 2015 Update (PDF)   Since its first printing in July 2003, the Redwood Creek Watershed Vision for the Future has been disseminated widely, and has served as a foundation and reference for numerous plans and projects. Its guiding principles and desired future conditions are as relevant today as they were in 2003, as managers, residents, and visitors continue to work together to achieve this shared vision. This second printing contains all of the original text, plus updated photos and maps.

The public plays an essential role in taking care of our National Parks, and decision making is greatly improved when we consider the public perspective. We need to hear from you...one comment can make a difference.   Although park planners and resource managers often have very specialized knowledge of an area, it would be impossible for them to know all the issues of importance to the hundreds of thousands of visitors to that area —this information needs to come from the visitors themselves. Park plans are more thorough because of the members of the public who have chosen to participate in them. Public comments are sought for major planning efforts to help identify the range of issues that should be addressed. Public scrutiny of proposed actions helps to ensure that actions are consistent with the National Park Service mission, enabling legislation, and other relevant laws and policies. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act and National Historic Preservation Act, each planning process provides at least two formal opportunities for the public to become involved. First, when a planning effort is announced, public scoping takes place. At that time, the public is asked to raise issues and concerns to help park staff identify areas of the plan that require more attention or are causes for concern. Once a draft document is released, the public is provided the opportunity to examine sets of proposals (known as \"alternatives\") and submit comments. The comments are then sorted and analyzed, with results often contributing to revisions in the final plan. Public comments made during scoping directly influence the draft plan. Park staff arecontinually reviewing your comments as they work to define the scope of what the plan willcover and develop alternatives to address the issues. Overviews of comments are often a formal part of planning meetings;at times comments are even posted during those meetings, so that public concerns are a constant presence and an active part of the discussion. As a formal part of the planning process, National Park Service staff read and analyze all comments submitted, and written responses are developed to address concerns. Park leadership will review and evaluate all responses, making them available once the draft plan is released. Comment letters or a summary of comments received will also be posted on the project planning website. Public meetings, site visits, workshops and open houses are a great way to share information about park projects and give interested public a chance to comment and make their voice heard.
