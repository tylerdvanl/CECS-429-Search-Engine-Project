Shuttle buses transport visitors from the Visitor Center to Lower Town where about four street blocks are lined with museums and exhibits. Additionally, there are over 20 miles of trails throughout the entire park, some of which begin in Lower Town.      Shuttle Buses The shuttle bus service at Harpers Ferry National Historical Park operates every day that the park is open. Buses travel between the park Visitor Center and the Lower Town during the Fall, Winter, and Spring. During the Summer an additional stop, Bolivar Heights, is added to the route. Buses begin service at 9 a.m. and end between 5:45 p.m. and 6:45 p.m. depending on the season. Please inquire at the Visitor Center for specific ending times on the day of your visit.       Harpers Ferry NHP shuttle bus NPS Photo\/C. Waters",
