Pets must be kept at all times on a leash not to exceed 6-feet in length and should not be left unattended. Barking dogs are considered a nuisance. Owners must remove them from the campground. Never leave your pet in a closed vehicle. Temperatures can soar to 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) in minutes. Your pet can quickly die of heat stroke in those conditions.",
