We encourage you to join the community of volunteers nationwide who donate their time and talent to our national parks. Come and support the mission of President's Park through a variety of volunteer opportunities! There are two ways you can get involved:  Volunteer for a special event in President's Park Volunteer for standard park operations  Who can volunteer?  Basically, anyone can volunteer, though some positions may have age limits. Volunteers must be physically able to do the job agreed upon. Youth under the age of 18 may volunteer with the written permission of a parent or guardian. Youth interested in paid summer employment may read more about opportunities at President's Park at our park's youth programs site. If you're not in the Washington, DC area, the National Park Service Youth Programs website will have information on programs throughout the country. President's Park is currently seeking Boy Scout volunteers for a number of positions within the park. To learn more about volunteering at President's Park, please contact the Volunteer Coordinator by e-mail or call 202-208-1631. Before volunteering, you will need to complete a volunteer application (PDF).       Volunteer Opportunities         Visitor Services Visitor Services Volunteers work at the information desks at the White House Visitor Center or at the Ellipse Visitor Pavilion, help with White House tour operations, or rove the park. Most volunteers work 4-6 hour shifts, once a week. For more information, click here (PDF).         Resource Management Volunteers who join the President's Park Patrol help to preserve and maintain the cultural landscape features of the Ellipse, Sherman and Lafayette Parks - all part of the President's back yard. They learn about the history of the green spaces surrounding the grounds of the White House while cleaning or assessing the condition of structures, weeding monument gardens, or gathering trash. This is a great way to take an active role in supporting your national park.

The memorial was dedicated on November 7, 1964 and underwent a major rehabilitation in 2009.    As part of a nationwide program to introduce scouts to resource stewardship and to continue to honor Scouting and the improvements to the site undertaken in 2009, President's Park is currently recruiting volunteers for two positions: 2 to 3 conservation volunteer coordinators (must have achieved rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America) and Boy Scout Troops, Varsity Scout Teams, or Venturing Crews to \"adopt\" the memorial as a group.   The conservation volunteer coordinators will work with park staff to schedule and guide the adopting group. Working with the group, they will oversee their work to maintain the memorial and surrounding area; in addition, they will help the scouting group lean more about the memorial and President's Park by delivering a short overview of the park and memorial and providing time for reflection on the role of scouting and volunteer service in meeting the needs of the nation.    Adopting Boy Scout Troops, Varsity Scout Teams, or Venturing Crews will work for approximately two hours on one (or more) Saturdays between March 2013 and Thanksgiving. Working together and with park maintenance staff, the conservation volunteer coordinators and adopting groups will help to maintain the memorial statue, base, fountain and surrounding deck area, as well as other adjacent portions of the park.   To sign up for either position, please visit volunteer.gov.   Details of these two positions are available as PDF files:    Conservation Volunteer Coordinators (Eagle Scouts only) Adopting Troop\/Team\/Crew",
