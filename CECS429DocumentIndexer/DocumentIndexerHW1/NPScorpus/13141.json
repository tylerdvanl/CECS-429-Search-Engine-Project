We list these events on this website when we know the dates for each year, as well as on volunteer.gov.   For all special events and drop-in days, the park asks participants to wear long pants and closed-toe shoes, appropriate gear for the weather, and bring sun protection, water, and snacks. The park provides tools and protective equipment.   All participants must sign a volunteer agreement [42 kb DOCX]. If you'd like to fill out the in advance, this form will be posted with each special event or drop-in project as they are planned (you can also sign one on the day of the project on-site). Guardians must sign the form for participants under the age of 18.  Drop-In Volunteering Help keep Yosemite beautiful!

Junior Ranger Day: April  Volunteer to earn your Junior Ranger Badge! As part of the Junior Ranger Day celebration, volunteers can do a restoration or litter project. Junior Ranger Day will be celebrated on Saturday, April 23, 2016 in conjunction with Earth Day. Apple Picking Day: August   Historic apple orchards in Yosemite Valley attract bears, leading them to eat non-native foods while increasing human-bear conflicts in parking areas and campgrounds near the orchards. To help decrease the impact of the orchards, volunteers are invited to pick apples, removing the temptations for the bears.   Yosemite Facelift (and National Public Lands Day) - last week in September  In partnership with the Yosemite Climbing Association, the National Park Service puts on this five-day event each September, Wednesday through Sunday including the last Saturday of the month. In 2012 over 1,200 volunteers cleaned up 20,000 pounds of debris from the park. To learn more, visit our partners at the Yosemite Climbing Association.",
