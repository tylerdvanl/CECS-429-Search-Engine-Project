Â    Mystic Lake Trail   Distance, round trip: 20.8 miles Elevation gain: 3900 feet Hiking time, round trip: 9 hours Wilderness Camps: Ipsut Creek, Carbon River, Dick Creek, Mystic Lake  Trail Description Visiting Professors J. B. Fleet and H. H. Garretson named Mystic Lake after reportedly seeing a mysterious whirlpool near the lake's outlet.   Hike 5 miles along Carbon River Road to Ipsut Campground. From there, follow the Wonderland Trail 1.7 miles to a log bridge crossing over the Carbon River, continuing on to the Northern Loop trail junction. Turn right at the junction and hike up the Carbon River to the Carbon Glacier. Continue along the Wonderland Trail up a steep series of switchbacks through the forest to reach Moraine Park. Beyond the meadows, the trail climbs up and down over two small wooded ridges. After climbing the second ridge, the trail descends a short distance to Mystic Lake. NOTE: Always check current trail conditions before heading out. Log footbridges frequently wash out during the winter or other conditions could be affecting the trail.  Along the Trail This trail offers hikers a close-up look at the terminus of the Carbon Glacier, the lowest elevation glacier in the contiguous 48 states. From Moraine Park the views of Mount Rainier's precipitous north side are spectacular! Marmots, pikas, and wildflowers abound in Moraine Park. The calm waters of Mystic Lake capture picture-perfect reflections of Mineral Mountain, particularly in the evening and early morning. Backpacking In an effort to preserve the shoreline of Mystic Lake, the camp is located along the Wonderland Trail in a forested area .3 mile downhill from the east end of the lake. The Mystic Lake Patrol Cabin is generally staffed by a ranger all summer, though not necessarily every day. Permits are required for camping. Permits and current trail conditions are available at park-wide from wilderness information centers, ranger stations, and visitor centers. Treat water before drinking. Fires are prohibited. No pets on trails.",
