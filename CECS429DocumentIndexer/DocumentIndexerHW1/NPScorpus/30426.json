A walk through any particular field will generally yield the patient observer a long list of grass species, including Kentucky bluegrass, black bentgrass, redtop, annual ryegrass, timothy, velvet grass, poverty grass, switchgrass, bromegrass, orchard grass, fowl meadow grass, and many others. While the natural vegetation of this region is forest, CVNP has one prairie, which was planted before the park was created. Situated on a disturbed area that was used as a borrow pit during construction of the Ohio Turnpike, this prairie is home to many species not commonly found in the area. The grasses of this area include big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, and Indian grass. When walking in wetter habitats, including forested wetlands, the visitor is likely to encounter sedges. Golden-fruited sedge, fox sedge, needle spikerush, hairy-fruited sedge, radiate sedge, pennsylvania sedge, wood sedge, wool grass, burr sedge, and more can be found in these areas.
