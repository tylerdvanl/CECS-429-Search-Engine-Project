    "body": "Ranger in the Classroom         A ranger in the classroom NPS Image  Available (and free!) to 4th grade classes, this activity comes with a ranger who will guide students through a 50-minute lesson. As everyone's budgets have grown tighter and tighter, fewer schools are able to afford the busses required for a trip to one of the national park sites. We hope the Ranger in the Classroom programs will fill a need to connect students with the National Park Service, the natural history of southeast Arizona, and the Coronado Expedition. We strive to offer some of the experiences students would have had during a park field trip. Marvelous Mammals (K - 5th grade): In this 50-minute program students will learn how to identify mammal characteristics through demonstrations and classroom activities.  Coronado’s Legacy (4th - 5th grade): Coronado’s expedition initiated a cultural clash and exchange between the Spanish and Native Americans. This 50-minute program explores the changes in cultures that occurred when Coronado came through this region and the legacy his expedition left behind.  Love of Reading Week (Kindergarten): Mid-February, 2016 (contact park for dates) Park staff from Coronado National Memorial share their love of reading with students in local schools. Each 30-minute program focuses on a book about the local region and include hands-on activities.  For more information please visit our Coronado Education website. For questions about programs and reservations please call us at (520) 366-5515 x2310 or email us.",
