    "body": "City Arch River 2015       The park's 2009 General Management Plan\/Environmental Impact Statement (GMP\/EIS) called for a design competition to improve visitor access and experience, while better integrating the park into downtown St. Louis. The competition began in December 2009, and the winning concept was ultimately selected in September 2010 by a jury from a field of five finalists.  This project has became part of a broader initiative known as CityArchRiver 2015, and provides a unique and important opportunity to integrate the Gateway Arch and the park surrounding it into the fabric of the city. The design concept continues to evolve as the result of ongoing design discussions with the NPS, however, site-specific project details are beginning to emerge and compliance is ultimately needed to evaluate the potential effects of the actions proposed by the winning design team for revitalization of the park.  Follow these links for more information about how the NPS will comply with regulations for environmental and historic preservation.
