    "body": "Drive-in Camping Photo Gallery       To help lakeshore visitors with larger camping units or a towed vehicle or trailer, we offer these photos of the parking area at each campsite at the drive-in campgrounds. The national lakeshore does not take advanced reservations at any of the campgrounds. However, we hope the photos will provide a better idea of what to expect when visiting these campgrounds and thus better plan your trip.  The maximum length of the hardened parking surface available is listed with each photo. Only two vehicles (including towed items) are allowed per site, and both must be parked in within this available space.  Each campsite has a picnic table, grill, and tent pad.
