George Rogers Clark NHP was established to commemorate the accomplishments of George Rogers Clark and the expansion of the United States into the Northwest Territory; to commemorate this story and its significance to the American people; and to cooperate in the preservation, renewal and interpretation of the sites and structures in Vincennes associated with this story.The park also commemorates the actions of Father Pierre Gibault and Francis Vigo who sided with Clark against the British. The park is located on the site of Fort Sackville which Clark captured from the British during the American Revolution on February 25, 1779.The victory extended American land claims in the Ohio Valley and contributed to the United States acquisition of the Northwest Territory in the 1783 Treaty of Paris.No structures dating from the Revolution exist in the park today.
