The Arkansas State Plant Board has implemented an emergency quarantine to slow the spread of Emerald Ash Borer. Twenty-five counties in Arkansas are included in the ash quarantine, including Garland County--the one containing Hot Springs National Park. Quarantined items include firewood of all hardwood species, and the following ash items: nursery stock; green lumber with bark attached; other living material; dead, cut, or fallen wood, including logs, pulpwood, stumps, roots, branches, mulch, and composted\/uncomposted chips (1 inch or greater). Firewood is the only quarantined item that relates to all hardwood; all other quarantined items are relative to ash, only. Arkansas Agriculture Department\/Arkansas State Plant Board officials confirmed that the Emerald Ash Borer, an invasive beetle that attacks and kills ash trees, has been found in Hot Spring, Clark, and Nevada counties. The possession of firewood, whether hardwood or softwood, originating from a location for which a federal or state firewood quarantine is in effect is prohibited in Hot Springs National Park. This closure prohibits the movement of firewood into the park from counties adjacent to the park for which a federal or state quarantine is in place, even if the quarantine allows for movement within the county. Failure to comply may result in a citation or seizure of firewood.",
