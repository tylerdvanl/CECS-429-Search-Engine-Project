    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Safety             Safety       Hiking Safely Trails at Natural Bridges cross rough terrain that features sheer drop-offs. Stay on trails and watch your step at all times. Be careful near cliff edges, especially when rock is wet or icy. Check trail conditions at the visitor center before hiking.   Lightning and Flash Floods Late-summer monsoons can bring lightning and flash floods. During a lightning storm, avoid lone trees, cliff edges and high ridges. Return to your vehicle if possible. Flash floods can occur without warning. Never cross a canyon that is flooding.    Do Not Climb on the Bridges It is both dangerous and illegal.     Heat and Sun  In hot weather, be sure to drink 1 gallon (4 L) of water per day, wear a hat, and use sunscreen. Consider saving strenuous activity for early mornings or late evenings.   Protect Your Pets The desert can be deadly for pets. Car temperatures rise quickly in the sun, even on cool days. Your pet can easily die of heat exhaustion. If you are leaving a pet in a car, crack the windows as much as possible and leave water to drink. We recommend you not leave pets in the car at all when the outside temperature exceeds 68 degrees, even with the windows cracked. Pets are not permitted on hiking trails.   Staying Found  Always carry a map, adequate clothing and a flashlight. Remain in one place if you become lost or separated from your group. Wandering will endanger your life and make finding you difficult. When traveling alone, always tell someone where you are going and when you expect to return.   Wildlife Wild animals often carry deadly diseases, including hantavirus, bubonic plague and rabies, and may become aggressive without warning. Do not approach animals to take photographs, and teach children not to chase or pick up animals.",
