    "body": "Giant Forest Before and After Photos         Before and after view of cabin area in Giant Forest   Photographs taken from the same location before and after restoration reveal the natural landscape that was obscured by buildings, roads, and parking lots. In areas where planting was conducted to restore vegetation, tree and shrub seedlings are visible in the photographs. In areas where natural regeneration was the sole means of restoring vegetation, recovery is slower: tiny tree and shrub seedlings are present in many locations but not yet visible in the photographs. Photograph locations are permanently marked, and restoration sites will be photographed for at least 10 years after restoration to visually record site recovery. See below for before-after photo sets.      Former Campground Area -- Series 1       Above is a restored roadbed (2004) in the former Sugar Pine Campground at the north end of the Giant Forest developed area.
