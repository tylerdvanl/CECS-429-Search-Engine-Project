Wagons are allowed on all roads or multi-use trails as long as they are properly marked per state law. Wagon use on campground roads is prohibited. Travel from East Bandy Road to Duncan Hollow road via the campground road past the pool is permitted. All total, visitors may ride a wagon on 172 miles of roads (both paved and gavel-graded) at Big South Fork NRRA.       Big South Fork has developed detailed maps (below) depicting popular locations for wagon riders. Both maps are saved in PDF format.      Map 1 -- Middle Creek-Gobblers Knob Connector Route. 5.0 Miles Map 2 -- Oneida & Western Connector Route. 12.7 Miles         In 2013, a pilot program was created, where wagons are also allowed to ride on the entire stretch of the O&W, which is partially a horse trail. Wagons are allowed on the O&W and Tar Kiln trail. Access points are at the Mill Creek, Zenith and Tar Kiln gates. Keys for access to these trails must be checked out at Park Headquarters Monday through Friday between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. Eastern Time.
