The National Park Service has completed this document in cooperation with the Bureau of Land Management. The document reflects the comments and concerns shared with the study team during public scoping in Summer 2015. The NPS received over 11,000 comments during the scoping period. Please join us for one of four public meetings to be held in April and May. At these meetings, the NPS study team will explain the study findings, answer your questions, and gather your comments about the alternatives evaluated in the environmental assessment, including the NPS preferred alternative. A separate public meeting will be scheduled in the future to specifically discuss the possible withdrawal and potential transfer of administrative jurisdiction of federal lands within the area from the Bureau of Land Management to the National Park Service. This meeting will be announced through a Federal Register notice and through notice to those on the mailing list for this study. Thank you for taking the time to learn about and comment on this study. You may share your thoughts by mail, e-mail, online, or at one of the upcoming public meetings. We look forward to hearing from you! Your participation is a key component of this process.
