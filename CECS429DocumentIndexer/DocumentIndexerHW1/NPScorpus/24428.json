While much of this road is graded and covered with gravel, several dry wash crossings and a steep descent down a series of switchbacks known as the dugway over the first two miles, makes the use of a high clearance vehicle strongly advised. Due to the clay soil, the dugway is not passable when wet. Always check the weather before heading down the Echo Park Road.  Â     Echo Park Road",
