Davis  The natural resources of Eisenhower National Historic Site are prone to stresses from pollution, traffic, and nearby development. With the increased mobility of our advancing society, the park is experiencing ecological changes. Changes range from the introduction of invasive exotic plant species to the developing of lands surrounding the park. Park managers are taking an active role in addressing these changes with an adaptive management strategy. As scientific research provides protocols for monitoring the parks present state, we are able to deduce areas of concern that need assistance. Using research as tools, park managers can make decisions based on sound ecological or historical facts to ensure park resources are being protected.
