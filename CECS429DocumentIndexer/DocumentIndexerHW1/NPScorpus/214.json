    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Safety            Safety       The most important thing you can do to remain safe while exploring Pipestone National Monument is to remain on the paved trail while hiking. Keep the following points in mind:  Ticks and poison ivy are easily encountered off the paved trail. Quarries are especially dangerous because they are often steep, deep, and lined with loose rock that could cause injury or a fall. The areas of the trail with steps as well as the floor of the demonstration quarry can be slick when wet.  No drinking water is available along the trail.",
