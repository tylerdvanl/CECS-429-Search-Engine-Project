NPS photo  Sultana (f)  Born: 8\/05\/2006  Climbing Routes Litter  Sultana was the only female from her litter, so as a pup growing up with eight brothers she quickly became the ringleader of the bunch. Her tenacity and intelligence have made her a great lead dog since her first full winter in harness. Sultana has mothered three different litters here in the park (Volcanoes, Mining Claims, and Knots). She will be greatly missed when she retires in the fall of 2016.
