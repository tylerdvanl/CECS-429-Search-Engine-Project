Park personnel have been working to mitigate exotic invasive species, protect endangered species, address impacts on native wildlife populations, control shoreline erosion and assess air and water quality when threatened from adjacent developments.The 1781 Siege of Yorktown was waged amongst a living landscape of fields, forests, wetlands, and waterways - features that also impacted the decisions made by both General George Washington in prosecuting the siege and by General Charles Lord Cornwallis in developing his defenses.
