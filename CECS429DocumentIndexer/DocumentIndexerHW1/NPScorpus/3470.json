Hundreds of water samples are taken from the lake and analyzed using scientifically proven methods each year.        Analyzing FlowCAM images. NPS Photo  The Glen Canyon Wahweap Water Laboratory uses four early detection methods, including microscopic analysis, automated particle analysis (FlowCAM), Polymerase Chain Reaction (the DNA test), and the deployment of artificial substrates to detect early colonization. Sampling occurs lake-wide at routine sites like marinas and dams.         Quagga mussels collected off a boat on Lake Powell. NPS Photo  The Glen Canyon water lab continues to analyze water samples taken from Lake Powell to determine the range and extent of mussel colonization in the lake. Measurements are taken from mussels found on vessels, structures, and canyon walls to reconstruct population dynamics. This data makes up one of the first studies of an early mussel infestation in a water body the size of Lake Powell.",
