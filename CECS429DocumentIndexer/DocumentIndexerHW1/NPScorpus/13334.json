Artist rendering of new trail at same location (right).        The Mariposa Grove restoration project will restore the grove's dynamic ecology and increase its resilience. As a result of this project, the Mariposa Grove is currently closed and is expected to reopen in early summer 2017.  Once the project is completed, visitors to the Mariposa Grove will notice:  A consolidated parking area and information station at South Entrance  Many of the roads within the grove converted into hiking trails  Over a half-mile of new accessible trails and boardwalks providing universal access for all visitors to the grove Flush toilets replacing vault toilets in the grove Removal from the grove of commercial activities such as the gift shop and tram tours   Learn more about the project to restore the Mariposa Grove by watching this video, produced by Yosemite Conservancy, the primary non-profit partner supporting this project. You can also read a fact sheet about the restoration of the Mariposa Grove project [105 kb PDF].              Project Impacts   The Mariposa Grove is closed, with no vehicle or shuttle access available, from July 6, 2015 until approximately early summer 2017. South Entrance and the Wawona Road will remain open. We will attempt to provide additional access as work and weather permit. This page will be updated if access changes.  Foot and equestrian access is allowed along the Outer Loop Trail (see map), from which a relatively small number of sequoias are visible. (Find other places where you can see more giant sequoias.) Hikers and equestrians must remain on the trail, which travels through a closed area; the grove beyond the trail is closed and all other trails within the grove are closed. Hiking to the Outer Loop Trail involves a strenuous, 12-mile round-trip hike with 2,400 feet of elevation change (this doesn't include hiking the Outer Loop Trail). Allow eight to 10 hours for the hike. Drinking water and restrooms are not available. The trail begins in Wawona behind the last uphill building (Moore Cottage) of the Big Trees Lodge (formerly Wawona Hotel). Look for the trailhead 50 yards uphill marked by the sign \"Two Hour Trail Ride.\"  The Big Trees Tram Tour permanently ended in 2014. The Wawona-Mariposa Grove shuttle is not operating, but is planned to be replaced with a shuttle from South Entrance to the Mariposa Grove when the grove reopens.  Project Schedule 2014: Construct new accessible trail to the Grizzly Giant and repair of structures at Wawona Point. There were no closures in 2014. 2015: Removal of roads in the Mariposa Grove, construction of the replacement service road bypassing the lower grove, and construction of a new shuttle stop in the lower grove. 2016-2017: Construction of the South Entrance parking area and new restroom in the lower grove.   Other Places to See Giant Sequoias   Tuolumne Grove Yosemite National Park Located on the Tioga Road just east of Crane Flat, the Tuolumne Grove has about two dozen mature giant sequoias. Sequoias are only visible after a one-mile hike with 500 feet of elevation loss. (The one-mile hike back to the parking lot gains 500 feet and is strenuous.) Water is not available; bring drinking water for everyone in your group who will be hiking this trail. The drive takes about 1.5 hours from South Entrance. Parking is limited.  Merced Grove Yosemite National Park Located on the Big Oak Flat Road east of Big Oak Flat Entrance, the Merced Grove has about two dozen mature giant sequoias. Sequoias are only visible after a 1.5-mile hike with 500 feet of elevation loss. (The 1.5-mile hike back to the parking lot gains 500 feet and is strenuous.) Water is not available; bring drinking water for everyone in your group who will be hiking this trail. The drive takes about 1.5 hours from South Entrance. Parking is extremely limited.   North and South Calaveras Groves Calaveras Big Trees State Park Calaveras Big Trees State Park has perhaps twice as many giant sequoias as all of Yosemite National Park. Calaveras became a state park in 1931 and includes the Discovery Tree, also known as the Big Stump, the first Sierra redwood noted by Augustus T. Dowd in 1852. This area has been a major tourist attraction ever since, and is considered the longest continuously operated tourist facility in California. Accessible trails and other facilities are available. Directions From Yosemite’s Big Oak Flat Entrance, take Highway 120 west to its junction with Highway 49. Take Highway 49 north, through Sonora, to Angels Camp, then take Highway 4 east to Calaveras Big Trees State Park. This drive takes about a two hours.
