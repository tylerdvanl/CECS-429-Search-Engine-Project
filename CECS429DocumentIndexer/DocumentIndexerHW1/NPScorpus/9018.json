Campfires--we love them: sitting around a crackline fire, roasting a marshmallow to perfection, dodging smoke in your eyes, watching mesmerized as the flames dance. Unfortunately, bringing firewood into the park – and all the insects and diseases that may be hiding on it – puts our forests at risk. Bringing firewood into the park from anywhere else can rapidly spread destructive pests and diseases, as it did the emerald ash borer..  The Lakeshore has a firewood policy that will allows campers the warmth of their fires and helps prevent and slow the spread of forest pests and diseases, such as hemlock woolly adelgid, beech bark disease, Asian longhorn beetle, and oak wilt. The firewood policy states that campers may only use firewood acquired from vendors approved by the Lakeshore (see below) and may not bring firewood from home or anywhere else. The Lakeshore requests everyone’s help in protecting our forests.        Tunnels created by the emerald ash borer.    If you brought firewood into the Lakeshore If you brought firewood into the park, let a park ranger know. The ranger will tell you about voluntary actions you can take during our transition period to help protect our forests.  Do NOT unload firewood.  DO place firewood directly from your vehicle into a fire (this prevents the spread of insects along the ground). DO burn all of your wood completely. DO ask a park ranger about providing special bags to contain your wood for your return home.
