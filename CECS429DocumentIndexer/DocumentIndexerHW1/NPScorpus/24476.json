For Alaskan students it is a place to witness geological forces in action, climate change observed in glacial recession, plant succession laid out in clearly defined steps and animal adaptations that allow for life in an often harsh environment.  We hope to see you and your students soon to share the wonders found in your backyard.  On this page, you will find a list of the current offerings from our education staff.  All programs are free to educational groups. Plan a Field Trip  Clicking a link will bring you further down to that topic.  Marine Wildlife, Habitat, & Earth Sciences Clouds & Water Cycle Botany Alutiiq (Native Alaskan) Glaciers \"Leave No Trace\"        Magnifying glass in hand, this student is exploring the marine ecosystem, and becoming friends with a local sea star. NPS Photo  Marine Programs Tidepool Trekking for K-2nd grades This program begins with a 40 minute classroom discussion of tides and tide pool etiquette followed by a 90 minute hands-on exploration of the local intertidal ecosystem of Lowell Point State Park. Offered through cooperation with the state park, a national park ranger guides students in a safe -for both creatures and students- and fun encounter with the invertebrates of the intertidal. Due to the fragility of the Lowell Point Ecosystem this program is offered on a limited basis.    Spring - Classroom & Beach    Beach Ecosystems for 2nd & 3rd grades A 75 minute trip to Seward's Fourth of July Beach will reveal living and non-living wonders of the local ecosystem.

This program also emphasizes biodiversity and our role as stewards to these places.     Spring - Beach    Getting to Know Algae for 5th & 6th grades Students will visit Fourth of July Beach at low tide and look at algae that feed, protect and cover the intertidal ecosystem. This is a great 1.5 hour lesson for those looking at classification, because some algae still baffle scientists as to their exact origins. Students will examine several species of algae from three readily available phlya.   Spring\/Summer - Beach    Piecing Together the Fjord Estuary Ecosystem Puzzle for 5th-7th grades A 2 hour walk along Seward's waterfront gives students a look into past glacialogy, and present day estuary dynamics. Student groups will have a backpack of supplies to aid in their observations of the area. Participants will be asked to consider essential questions such as: How does geology influence human land use in the Resurrection Bay area? Students' observations can be used to fuel further discussion or a project in the classroom.   Spring\/Fall - Beach           In \"Thinking About Bears\", students will have an opportunity to learn about the lives of these icons of Alaska. NPS Photo  Wildlife, Habitat, and Earth Science Programs     Home Sweet Home for K-1st grades This 2 hour program is designed to be a first field trip experience for young students.

These activities work well with a unit about the water cycle in your classroom, and as a pre-visit for the 'Water, Water Everywhere' field trip.    Fall - Classroom   Water, Water Everywhere for 3rd-5th grades  This 2 hour walk is the perfect follow up to the classroom cloud program. Students will observe trees transpiring and groundwater seeping to the surface. They will discuss meltwater and weather and identify how each part of the weather cycle impacts the Exit Glacier area.     Fall - Exit Glacier            In \"Botany by GPS\", students have the opportunity to explore and observe the variety of plant life that surrounds the Exit Glacier area. NPS Photo  Botany Programs   Finding Your Way in the World for 6th grade  This 1.5 hour program is a pre-visit component to 'Botany by GPS'. Students will become familiar with GPS units and plant ID books that they will later use to find plants at Exit Glacier. Students will learn how GPS works and why having a common language for location is so important. Rangers will provide plant books and GPS units that classes can keep until their field trip.     Fall - Classroom    Botany by GPS for 6th grade  In this practical application of 'Finding Your Way in the World' students spend 2.5 hours exploring the Exit Glacier trails finding and photographing plants and other things they notice along the way.
