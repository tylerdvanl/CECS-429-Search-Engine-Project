A park ranger from Shenandoah National Park will come to your classroom and lead learning activities within a 45 - 60 minute class period. Through these programs, students will investigate the park's natural features and cultural history and learn how to become better stewards of our local environment. The programs are designed for 4th and 5th grade classes and align with Virginia Standards of Learning. The programs include teacher-led pre-visit and post-visit activities that enhance the ranger presentation. \"Shenandoah in Your School\" programs are free of charge and are available to schools within a 1 hour drive of Shenandoah National Park from November through April. The maximum class size for the ranger program and activities is 25 students, but multiple 1-hour programs can be presented during a school day.  4th Grade: The Changing World of the Shenandoah Salamander 5th Grade: Shenandoah National Park: Gem of the Blue Ridge Region of Virginia  Download a flyer about Shenandoah In Your School here.
