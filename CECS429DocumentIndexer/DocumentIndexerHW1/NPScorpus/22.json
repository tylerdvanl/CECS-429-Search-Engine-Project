In addition, we currently have an inventory of processed seed from 48 different species.About a fourth of these species are ones that we have not tried to grow yet.We will be attempting to propagate a few of these in the coming year. We will also be expanding our capacities into growing wetland, marsh, and other aquatic plants.Expanding into these new areas will be crucial as we start restoring more shoreline and near-shore habitats.
