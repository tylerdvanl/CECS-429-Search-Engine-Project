    "body": "Donate       Donate to Your Park We can accept checks or money orders made payable to the National Park Service. If you have a specific passion and would like the money to go to that cause, you should write a letter or note and request how you would like the money to be spent.  We would then set up a specific account number to be used for that purpose solely. If you just wish for the park to receive the money, then the park will deposit those funds in the \"general\" donation account which typically funds educational and interpretive events at the park.  Â    Our address is Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island Attention: Superintendent Ellis Island Receiving Office Jersey City, New Jersey  07305",
