    "body": "Field Trip Programs     Make an adventure out of learning!  Explore our Field Trip options below. Though Gates of the Arctic National Park & Preserve is remote, students can learn about the natural and cultural history of this astonishingly wild resource through field trips to the Fairbanks Alaska Public Lands Information Center located inside the Morris Thompson Cultural and Visitors Center. Join park rangers for standards-based educational programs that utilize engaging hands-on activities and multimedia presentations that bring the park alive. The world-class exhibits at the Morris Thompson Cultural and Visitors Center enhance the field trip experience with dioramas of boreal forest and tundra landscapes, cultural artifacts and displays of Alaska’s varied natural resources.  Teachers may choose from an array of age-appropriate “I Spy” scavenger hunts that guide students' visit to the exhibits. Teachers may also schedule a film to complement their field trip (dependent on theater availability).  \"I Spy\" Scavenger Hunts:  Pictorial, K - 3rd grades, 4th - 6th grades     Results   Showing results 1-10 of 10    Sort By:  Title Date         1st grade ‹ Bears   Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve and Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve are home to many bears.
