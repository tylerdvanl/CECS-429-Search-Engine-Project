In the early 1830s, he was invited to join a delegation of officials from the Imperial Court on a journey to Kyoto, which inspired this series of prints titled, Kyoto Meisho, featuring famous places of Kyoto. This set was either a gift of family friend, Sho Nemoto, to the Billings Family, or perhaps purchased by them during their trip to Japan in 1898.       Andō Hiroshige MABI 2205: Passenger Boat on the Yodo River         Andō HiroshigeMABI 2206: Gion Shrine in Snow         Andō Hiroshige MABI 2207: Shower at Twilight, Tadasugawara         Andō Hiroshige MABI 2208: The Village of Yase         Andō Hiroshige MABI 9288a: Cherry Blossom at Arashiyama         Andō Hiroshige MABI 9288b: Cherry Blossom at Kiyomidzu Temple         Andō Hiroshige MABI 9288c: The Cool of the Evening at Shijo         Andō Hiroshige MABI 9288d: Tsuten Bridge         Andō Hiroshige MABI 9288e Shimbara         Andō Hiroshige MABI 9288f: Kinkakuji Temple",
