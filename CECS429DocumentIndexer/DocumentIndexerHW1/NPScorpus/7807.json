The historical reenactments scheduled each summer focus on and illustrate the years during which Fort Union operated as a trading post, 1828-1867.           Fort Union: The Trading Post   19 Photos  What does Fort Union Trading Post look like? These images show the inside and outside of the fort as well as, in the future, its bastions, Bourgeois House, Clerk's Office, and Trade Room.          Indian Arts Showcase   9 Photos  The Indian Arts Showcase is an annual event that commemorates American Indian history and culture through storytelling, music, traditional crafts, and presentations by tribal elders and historians from the Upper Missouri tribes.            Wildlife: Mammals   18 Photos  One can see mammals at Fort Union Trading Post? You better believe it. There's an amazing and often surprising variety of mammals or signs of them to be seen. Why? Because the historic fur trade fort faces the Missouri River and its partially wooded bottoms, which provides mammals with ready access to food, water, and shelter. The open and partially restored prairie that encompasses the fort's remaining three sides likewise offers mammals such as mule and white-tail deer food and easy access to the river.          Fort Union: The Land and Sky   6 Photos  More than 180 years after the American Fur Company chose the location to build its grandest Upper Missouri trading post, the landscape remains one the posts' builders and employees would readily recognize. The location selected wasn't one they'd themselves picked out, however; it was a spot suggested by members of the Assiniboine tribe long-familiar with the region. They knew the dense gravel deposits on the Missouri River's north bank west of the Yellowstone River helped to prevent the land's erosion. That wisdom alone helped to preserve the fort's remains, which made it possible to reconstruct the post on its original location in the 1980s and 1990s. This is why the views from today's Fort Union so closely resemble the historic scenes preserved in drawings, paintings, sketches, and photogrphs produced during the post's active years, 1828-1867.",
