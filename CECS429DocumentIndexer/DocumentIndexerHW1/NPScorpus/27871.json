Tonia Foster  The surface of Jewel Cave National Monument has a variety of mammals that you might be lucky enough to see. White-tailed deer, mule deer, eastern cottontail rabbits and red squirrels are often seen near the Visitor Center. Bighorn sheep, recently reintroduced to the area, are occasionally seen near Highway 16 within the monument boundaries. Rocky Mountain elk spend some time in the monument, but are much more secretive and rarely seen.  Packrats use the cave near the Historic Entrance as a home and are sometimes seen by visitors on the Lantern Tour. Remember that the animals you might see at Jewel Cave are wild. Please do not approach them or attempt to feed them.",
