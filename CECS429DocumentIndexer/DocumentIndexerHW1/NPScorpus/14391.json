Many of these families were of Scots-Irish descent and brought with them their traditions, music, language, and methods of survival. Life in the mountains was sometimes harsh but the mountains were home to many of these families, some of which remain in the area today. Numerous educational programs and activities offered at Cumberland Gap National Historical Park showcase life in the southern mountains.  Â      Farmer working in a field near Caylor, Virginia with Cumberland Mountain in background Photo by Earl Palmer  Survival in the southern mountains meant living off of the land. Between the mountain ridges, the valleys were much more fertile and better to farm. Wild plants served to cure many of the more common mountain ailments and crops such as corn and sorghum were staples of the people that lived throughout the region. Hogs, sheep, chickens, and some cattle provided food, milk, and eggs. All activities were generally geared toward survival.",
