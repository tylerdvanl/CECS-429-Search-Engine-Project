The site was so designated because of its history as a part of our nation's seacoast defense. Fort Sumter is rich in cultural and archaeological history, therefore, the National Park Service must be constantly aware of existing threats to the resource by those who would not respect its preservation ideals. The Service's mandate requires that it carefully plan and regulate the use of the park so that the park's resources are perpetuated and maintained unimpaired for future generations. Thus, the limits and kinds of use are circumscribed by requirements of resource management and protection. Please review Fort Sumter National Monument's park regulations for details.
