    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility             Accessibility       Gates of the Arctic is a vast wilderness area without trails or any developed infrastructure, designated by Congress to remain a \"primitive\" area in most respects. The National Park Service strives to make the park's visitor center in Bettles as universally accessible as possible. However, extra obstacles will be encountered in the park, which is essentially all backcountry because of the remote, wilderness nature of this special place.  If you have questions concerning accessibility, please contact us at 907 692-5494 or email us.  Also, learn about the The America the Beautiful National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Access Pass -- or simply, the Access Pass -- which provides a wide range of discounts on activities and services when you visit federal lands.",
