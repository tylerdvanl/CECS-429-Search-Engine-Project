Courtesy NPS   Â    The Teacher in Residence (TiR) program at Rocky Mountain National Park provides opportunities for in-service teachers of Colorado's Front Range who are within a one-day's field trip distance to spend June and July working in Rocky Mountain National Park connecting with the resources and participating in a variety of duties that suit their interests and the needs of the park's education program. Teachers lead activities and develop lesson plans based on their park experience for use in their classroom and in the park. The program focuses on teachers from schools with ethnically diverse student populations, who have had little or no experience with national parks or limited opportunity to explore them. Teachers from Title I schools are especially encouraged to apply. Program Background Teachers spend 8-10 weeks working and living in the park. During this time, the park provides a ranger uniform, shared housing, and a stipend. Once they return to their schools, teachers bring national parks into the classroom throughout the school year. During National Park Week in April, teachers engage their classrooms and other teachers in activities that relate to Rocky Mountain National Park.
