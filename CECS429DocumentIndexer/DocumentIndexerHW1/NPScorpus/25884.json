He systematically researched and explored the cave by recording information about the cave and the passages, naming rooms and routes, and making maps. Alvin’s journal gives us insights into the unusual decorations he found and the understanding people of those times had of the cave.        Alvin’s Signature on the Wall in the Cave NPS Photo  A Complex and Intriguing Cave In 1892, Alvin reported that he had “given up the idea of finding the end to Wind Cave.” On April 13, 1894 the Hot Springs Star reported: “They are still finding new rooms at the Wind Cave and we have about come to the conclusion there is no end to it.” Today explorers tend to agree with Alvin. Wind Cave is a vast wilderness and the early explorers helped those who followed understand that it is an intriguing, unique place.        Alvin McDonald Diary Entry NPS Photo  Alvin McDonald's Diary Entries:        Alvin McDonald Diary Entry NPS Photo         Alvin McDonald Diary Entry NPS Photo         Half Mile Hall NPS Photo  One of Alvin's major goals was to find the end of Wind Cave.
