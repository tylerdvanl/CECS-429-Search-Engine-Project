National historic trails recognize diverse facets of history such as prominent past routes of exploration, migration, trade, communication, and military action. The historic trails generally consist of remnant sites and trail segments, and thus are not necessarily contiguous. Although national historic trails are administered by federal agencies, land ownership may be in public or private hands.
