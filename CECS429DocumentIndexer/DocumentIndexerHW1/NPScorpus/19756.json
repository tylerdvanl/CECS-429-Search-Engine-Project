    "body": "Amphibians                   Spotted Salamander (Ambystoma maculatum)               Eastern Spadefoot (Scaphiopus holbrookii)         Â    Because these animals live on land but breed in and near water, you are likely to spot amphibians in or near the Chattahoochee River. These cold-blooded animals depend on the sun to warm them while basking on a riverside rock or scurrying along a tree lined trail. The waters of the river supply a comfortable breeding location as well as a place to cool down. The larvae typically are aquatic breathing through gills. In the adult stages the amphibians become semi-terrestrial, breathing through lungs as well as through their moist, glandular skin. For a list of amphibians found in the park visit the NPSpecies page.
