NPS photo  Minnesota has a continental climate characterized by cold winters and warm summers--a land of extremes.  Spring brings moderate temperatures and low humidity. Hiking trails may be muddy or even underwater if the river is high and trail closures in low lying areas are a possibility. Mosquitoes may be present in spring through mid-summer in forested areas.    Summer days may reach temperatures of more than 100°F (38°C), but are usually pleasant with temperatures in the low to mid-80°F (25-30°C) range. Summer thunderstorms are not unusual.  Autumn brings dry, warm days, cool nights and gorgeous fall colors. Autumn is a wonderful time of year for fishing, boating, bicycling or hiking along the river.    Winter days can, rarely, get no warmer than -10°F (-23°C) with cutting winds and blowing snow. Most daytime highs in mid-winter, however, are around 25°F (-3°C). Temperatures are often cold, but comfortable with the right clothing.    This great river--a river of history and wildlife--is a wonderful place to visit in any season.",
