Crater Lake National Park offers several education programs for visiting school groups. The Classroom at Crater Lake program for upper elementary students invites classes come to the park twice during the school year - once in the fall, and again in the spring (on snowshoes!). Topics covered include geology, watersheds, and plant and animal adaptations. Another program focuses on Earthcaching for middle and high school students. The experience uses GPS units to find way points and learn more about the park. We also can arrange guided interpretive hikes by request. All programs are curriculum-based and tied to the Oregon State Content Standards. Many resources for teaching about Crater Lake can be found here on our website, including field trip planning information, pre and post visit lessons, and lessons beyond science focusing on a variety of disciplines.
