Any groups larger than 12 should call the Visitor Center at 423-638-3551 to make reservations in advance. During the summer months, tours of the home may be suspended due to dangerous interior heat indexes. The park may be closed for inclement weather during the winter. Call the Visitor Center prior to your visit at 423-638-3551 to check conditions if there is doubt. The home is open for tours daily with the exception of Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's Day.
