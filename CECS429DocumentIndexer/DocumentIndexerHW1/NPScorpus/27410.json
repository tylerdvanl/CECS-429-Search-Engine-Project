There were 15 Launch Control Facilities that commanded and controlled 150 Launch Facilities (Missile Silos) holding Minuteman Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles. Two of these facilities survive in their historic state, Launch Control Facility Delta-01 with its corresponding underground Launch Control Center and Launch Facility (Missile Silo) Delta-09. These two sites, along with a Visitor Center, comprise Minuteman Missile National Historic Site.      News Browse press releases and subscribe to updates. A Press Kit is also available.
