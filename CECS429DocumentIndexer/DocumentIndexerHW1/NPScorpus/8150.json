Millions of visitors travel the Going-to-the-Sun Road every year, changing behaviors of some wildlife species. This film highlights research on mountain goats at Logan Pass where researchers are looking at various factors to determine why these goats act differently than others throughout the park.  Duration:4 minutes, 50 seconds                                A Changing Landscape: Glacier's Warming Climate Climate change is changing landscapes and creating impacts throughout the world. Glacier National Park is no exception. Around 1850, an estimated 150 glaciers existed within the present boundaries of the park. Today, only 25 glaciers remain and are predicted to disappear by 2030, if not earlier. This film explores current research on the park's melting glaciers and how the park's ecosystem is responding to climate change.  Duration:5 minutes, 25 seconds                                Common Loon Citizen Science Program Join the staff and volunteers of the Research Learning Center as they discuss the value of the Common Loon Citizen Science Program to science and research in Glacier National Park.  Duration:5 minutes, 29 seconds                                Invasive Plants Citizen Science Program Learn how to get involved with the Invasive Plants Citizen Science Program and help us reduce threats to Glacier National Park's native plant species.  Duration:4 minutes, 27 seconds                                Lords & Ladies: The Harlequin Ducks of Glacier National Park Harlequin ducks are a species of concern in Montana. Little is known about where they nest and their habitat requirements for survival. This film highlights a three-year research project that examines the factors influencing harlequin duck reproductive success and survival on Upper McDonald Creek in Glacier National Park.  Duration:7 minutes, 3 seconds                                Glaciers & Climate Change Research Ecologist, Dan Fagre with the USGS, explains the impacts of climate change on Glacier National Park's ecosystem.  Duration:3 minutes, 13 seconds                                Glacier's Geologic Story Geologist Chris Weiss highlights the interesting and unique geologic history of Glacier National Park.  Duration:2 minutes, 36 seconds                                Grizzly Bear Research Research Biologist, Kate Kendall with the USGS, explains the exciting work being done in Glacier to help understand one of the most magnificent animals on the North American Continent.  Duration:4 minutes, 1 second                                The Work of Water This video is part of Work House: A Glacier National Park Science Education Program created by the Division of Interpretation & Education at Glacier National Park with the help of many people from the Blackfeet, Kootenai, Salish & Pend d'Oreille Culture Committees, and schools within the Blackfeet and Flathead Reservations. In this lesson, students build a model to help them understand and describe the role of water, erosion, and sedimentation in shaping the landscape.Additional Work House teaching materials are available on the park's education page.http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/glac\/learn\/education\/indian-education.htm  Duration:2 minutes, 27 seconds                                Triple Divide This video is part of Work House: A Glacier National Park Science Education Program created by the Division of Interpretation & Education at Glacier National Park with the help of many people from the Blackfeet, Kootenai, Salish & Pend d'Oreille Culture Committees, and schools within the Blackfeet and Flathead Reservations. In this lesson, students model how water in Glacier National Park flows into three major river systems - the Columbia, the Mississippi and the Saskatchewan.Additional Work House teaching materials are available on the park's education page.http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/glac\/learn\/education\/indian-education.htm  Duration:1 minute, 47 seconds                                Erosion and Preservation of the Water Table This video is part of Work House: A Glacier National Park Science Education Program created by the Division of Interpretation & Education at Glacier National Park with the help of many people from the Blackfeet, Kootenai, Salish & Pend d'Oreille Culture Committees, and schools within the Blackfeet and Flathead Reservations. In this lesson, students model how vegetation can help to reduce soil erosion.Additional Work House teaching materials are available on the park's education page.http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/glac\/learn\/education\/indian-education.htm  Duration:1 minute, 18 seconds                                Formation of Mountains and Faults This video is part of Work House: A Glacier National Park Science Education Program created by the Division of Interpretation & Education at Glacier National Park with the help of many people from the Blackfeet, Kootenai, Salish & Pend d'Oreille Culture Committees, and schools within the Blackfeet and Flathead Reservations. In this lesson, students model various geologic processes.Additional Work House teaching materials are available on the park's education page.http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/glac\/learn\/education\/indian-education.htm  Duration:2 minutes, 50 seconds                                Carving Mountains This video is part of Work House: A Glacier National Park Science Education Program created by the Division of Interpretation & Education at Glacier National Park with the help of many people from the Blackfeet, Kootenai, Salish & Pend d'Oreille Culture Committees, and schools within the Blackfeet and Flathead Reservations. In this lesson, students use clay to build models of glacial formations to help them understand how massive ice sheets shaped much of the landscape we see today.Additional Work House teaching materials are available on the park's education page.http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/glac\/learn\/education\/indian-education.htm  Duration:1 minute, 6 seconds                                Model Glaciers This video is part of Work House: A Glacier National Park Science Education Program created by the Division of Interpretation & Education at Glacier National Park with the help of many people from the Blackfeet, Kootenai, Salish & Pend d'Oreille Culture Committees, and schools within the Blackfeet and Flathead Reservations. In this lesson, students use ice block models to mimic some of the processes that occurred when glacial ice covered much of the landscape-advancing and retreating, to create U-shaped valleys, moraines, and various other glacial features.Additional Work House teaching materials are available on the park's education page.http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/glac\/learn\/education\/indian-education.htm  Duration:1 minute, 31 seconds",
