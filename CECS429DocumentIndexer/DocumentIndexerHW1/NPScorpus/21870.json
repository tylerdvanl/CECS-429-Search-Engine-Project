The humid maritime climate influences much of the plant life, characterized by relatively heavy precipitation with a small temperature range between seasons. Glaciation has defined the geologic history and left a legacy that defines today's topography. Soils exhibit the relative age of each landform within the park's varied landscape. The Indian River's hydrologic activity is perhaps the most significant environmental factors within the park: an ecosystem for salmon and all that rely on the aquatic environment. Ultimately, climate change is a human-based factor that alters Sitka National Historical Park's resources, in time, could detract from it ecological integrity.          Interns assist with natural resource monitoring NPS Photo  Climate Change   Although the natural and cultural resources of Sitka National Historical Park are increasingly at risk due to climate change, we are also in a unique position to provide baseline data and monitor long term changes through ongoing research efforts.

Here, due to the warm ocean currents that pass by Baranof Island, winters are mild and summers are wet, keeping the rainforest happy with a constant supply of rain, fog, and mist. Read more about the local climate and weather conditions.           The pristine waters of Indian River flow through Sitka National Historical Park NPS Photo \/ Andrea Willingham  Hydrologic Activity Indian River is one of the primary natural resources in the park. The river continuously shapes the interconnections of the land, plants, and animals that thrive in the park. Learn about the park's dynamic hydrologic activity.",
