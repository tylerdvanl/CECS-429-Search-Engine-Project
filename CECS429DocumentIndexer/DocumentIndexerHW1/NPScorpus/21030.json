NPS Photo      It’s easy to get around Cabrillo National Monument.  State Highway 209, also known as Cabrillo Memorial Drive, is the only road leading into the park, and it is signed and well-marked.  Wide, paved paths and sidewalks lead visitors to the Visitor Center Complex, Lighthouse area, Whale Overlook, and Military History Exhibit.  If a member of your party is unable to walk to the Lighthouse area, stop in at the Visitor Center for a pass that will enable you to drive there.",
