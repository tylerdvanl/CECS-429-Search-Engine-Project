Â    Commercial Use Authorizations Commercial Use Authorizations are issued to provide commercial services to park area visitors in limited circumstances. CUAs, although used to authorize commercial services to park area visitors, are not Concession Contracts. They are intended to provide a simple means to authorize suitable commercial services to visitors in park areas in the limited circumstances in the legislation.  Special Use Permits Special Use Permits are required for special events such as commercial photography or filming, weddings and other ceremonies, group activities with more than 30 people or 15 vehicles in the picnic area, gatherings, distribution of printed material and other public expressions of views, and other activities that are otherwise controlled or prohibited.   Research Permits National Parks make wonderful laboratories. If you are interested in a permit for conducting research in the park, please email our Resource Management Division at Fort Bowie National Historic Site.",
