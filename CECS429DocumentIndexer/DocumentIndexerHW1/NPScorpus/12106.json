The Tule Lake Segregation Center National Historic Landmark and nearby Camp Tulelake in California were both used to incarcerate Japanese Americans forcibly removed from the west coast of the United States.   They encompass the original segregation center's stockade, the War Relocation Authority Motor Pool, the Post Engineer's Yard and Motor Pool, a small part of the Military Police Compound, several historic structures used to imprison Japanese Americans and to detain German and Italian prisoners of war at Camp Tulelake, and the sprawling landscape that forms the historic setting.        Photo by Robert Ross       Learn more about the Japanese Internment experience from these organizations:  National Historic Sites Manzanar> Minidoka>  Other Organizations Densho> National Japanese American Historical Society>  Japanese American National Museum> Tule Lake Committee>  PBS>  Library of Congress>  The National Archives>",
