    "body": "Explore This Park    Learn About the Park     Management     Public Involvement              Public Involvement       The Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy requires that \"every area with burnable vegetation must have an approved fire management plan (FMP).\" FMPs must provide for firefighter and public safety;include fire management strategies, tactics, and alternatives;address values to be protected and public health issues;and be consistent with resource management objectives, activities of the area, and environmental laws and regulations. The Nationwide Multi-Unit Fire Management Plan \/ Environmental Assessment (FMP\/EA) will analyze the effects of proposed mechanical treatments, prescribed fire, and wildfire management actions at 28 park units nationwide. Each of the 28 park units will prepare its own FMP, but the EA will serve as the overall compliance document for the 28 units. The 28 park units are being combined under one FMP\/EA because the units (which include parks, preserves, monuments, historic sites, and trails) have very low to low wildfire occurrence and desire to implement prescribed fire and mechanical treatments. The National Park Service has determined that it is most cost-effective and efficient to prepare one compliance document (the EA) to cover the smaller fire management programs. The National Park Service wants to know your thoughts about the proposed action described in the Scoping Document.Comments can be expressed as concerns, thoughts, and suggestions (such as for a new alternative) for the proposed use of mechanical treatments and prescribed fire and wildfire management actions described in the Scoping Document which can be found at: http:\/\/parkplanning.nps.gov\/document.cfm?documentID=70314  Â   Documents Open for Public Review  Loading ...
