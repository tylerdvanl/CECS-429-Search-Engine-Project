Whether you share a run along the volcanoes or a quiet walk in Rinconada Canyon, always be aware of your surroundings and considerate of others. It takes a cooperative effort to make the park safe and enjoyable for everyone. Dogs are not allowed in Boca Negra Canyon. Boca Negra Canyon is the most heavily visited area within the monument. Its short, partly paved trails are easy for seniors, for the physically challenged, and for young children to walk on. It becomes very crowded on the narrow trails and because of the congestion dogs are not allowed. If you want to visit Boca Negra Canyon we suggest you leave your dog at home. Dogs are not allowed inside public buildings such as the visitor center, offices, and public restrooms. Service Dogs Service dogs are those that assist people who have accessibility or medical needs. They are welcome throughout Petroglyph National Monument, provided that they are on a leash. Why Your Dog Should Be on a Leash Petroglyph is one of 405 units of the federal national park system. The National Park Service mission is to assure the protection of natural and cultural resources, and provide for the enjoyment of those resources in such a way that leaves them unimpaired for future generations. With over 24,000 petroglyphs and hundreds of historic resources, Petroglyph National Monument faces serious challenges. To meet these challenges, we ask all visitors to minimize their impacts on park resources and on other visitors. When dog owners cooperate with city and federal park regulations, the impact of their dogs is minimal. For the Protection of Park Wildlife and Plants Many dogs chase and threaten wildlife. Your dog may scare birds or other wildlife away from nesting, feeding, and resting sites. The scent left behind by your dog can signal the presence of a predator to park wildlife, disrupting or altering their behavior. Digging may destroy an animal's home. Uncontrolled dogs can damage important rare native plants.  For the Safety of Other Visitors Unleashed dogs and their excrement disturb visitors who come to enjoy the monument. Many people, especially children, are afraid of dogs, even friendly ones. Some fear being knocked over or bitten. Holes left behind by dogs can result in injury to park visitors.  For the Safety of Your Dog Unfamiliar sights, sounds, and smells can disturb even the calmest and friendliest dog. Your dog may be lost, injured, or suffer a painful or even fatal fall. Wildlife may bite or transmit disease to your dog. Coyotes are known to trick loose dogs into chasing them, only to lead a dog to the coyote pack where it becomes dinner. Your dog may encounter a rattlesnake, or be exposed to poisonous plants or other plants that have thorns or burrs. On a leash and on a trail, your dog will be less likely to encounter these dangers. It's the Law Where dogs are permitted, federal law requires dogs to be on a leash, not to exceed six feet in length, in all units of the national park system. You may be cited and fined for violation of leash, wildlife and litter laws. (36 CFR Part 2). Please Remember When you bring your dog to the park, please remember to:    Keep your dog on a leash and under control.   Clean up after your dog and dispose of waste in a trash receptacle.   Bring plenty of water for yourself and your dog.   Ensure your dog never chases wildlife or digs holes.   Never leave your pet unattended, tied to an object, or in a car without ventilation or water.   Do not allow your dog to bark, howl, or whine excessively.      It is every dog owner's responsibility to follow all city and federal regulations at all times when visiting Petroglyph National Monument. Remember that it takes a cooperative effort to make the monument safe and enjoyable for everyone.  Petroglyph National Monument thanks you for being a responsible dog owner.
