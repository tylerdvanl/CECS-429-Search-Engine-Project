While the park has been legislatively established, there is still quite a bit work to do. First and foremost, the National Park Service is working with the local communities, state agencies, and other stakeholders to help us draw the final park boundary. Once that is determined, work will progress on the planning and construction of facilities and exhibits for the park.  Fortunately, the National Park Service has almost 30 years of experience of working in the Blackstone Valley with the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor. So while the park is not finished yet, we have a small staff of rangers out and about, and a number of sites being operated by our partners where you can go to explore the Blackstone Valley story.
