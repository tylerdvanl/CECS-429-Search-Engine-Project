There are many ways you can help - click on the hotlinks for more details!. Become a volunteer! Volunteering is a fun and exciting way you can contribute to your National Park. Hours are flexible. Many opportunities are available whether helping in visitor services, maintenance or our living history program. Join the Friends of Fort McHenry. The Friends help raise funds and are instrumental in sponsoring large events such as the Star-Spangled Banner Weekend. Donate directly. Anyone can give financially to the park. Funds so donated stay here and go towards helping pay for items and services not normally possible due to budget constraints. Consider full or part time employment. Each year National Parks across the country count on seasonal staff to help with the increased Summer visitation.",
