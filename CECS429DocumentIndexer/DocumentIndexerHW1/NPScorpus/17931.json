Black bear, bison, elk, and the now extinct Passenger Pigeon were all common residents of the area where the Fort Smith National Historic Site is now located. While walking the grounds keep and eye out for one of the park's many Fox Squirrels. These playful critters thrive on the park's abundant acorns, walnuts, and pecans.
