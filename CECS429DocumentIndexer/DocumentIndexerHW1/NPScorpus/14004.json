There are many easy and enjoyable hikes to take and even some ranger programs to attend.  Stop by one of our visitor centers to get directions and information about the following suggested hikes:  Walk the .1 mile paved trail from the overlook parking area to the East Rim Overlook for an outstanding view of the Big South Fork River and gorge. Stop at Leatherwood Ford and take a leisure walk along the river in either direction for a short ways before turning around and returning to your car. The easy 1.3 mile long Bandy Creek Loop Trail is an excellent beginner's introduction to hiking.  The trail starts in front of the Bandy Creek Visitor Center or across the parking lot at the far end of the pond.  Near the stables, be prepared to yield to horseback riders. From Stearns, Kentucky, drive to the parking area for Devils Jump Overlook.  The ten minute walk provides a spectacular view of a large boulder and rapid on the Big South Fork River.  Drive to the Blue Heron Coal Mining Community or ride the Big South Fork Scenic Railway from Stearns, KY.  Walk the paved trails that weave up and down the hillside at Blue Heron.  Stop at the displays to learn what it was like to live in a coal camp.  Walk across the tipple bridge for a nice view of the Big South Fork River.    With a little help, your child can become a Junior Ranger!     Stop at Bandy Creek Visitor Center or at the Blue Heron Coal Mining Community to pick up a free junior ranger booklet.  Once the activities are completed, a park ranger can check it over and issue a badge and patch.   Pick up our latest park newspaper on your next visit to view all of the programs and activities scheduled for families to attend.",
