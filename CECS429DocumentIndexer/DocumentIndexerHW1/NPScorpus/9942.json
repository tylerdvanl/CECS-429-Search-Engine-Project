The historic landscapes found on the Keweenaw Peninsula, along with the buildings and features they contain serve as tangible reminders of our nation’s copper mining heritage. They also reflect the culture, traditions and customs of the people who make their homes here today. Historic sites both within and outside the park invite each of us to make our own connections to this place.  The national historical park consists of two separate units - Quincy and Calumet - 12 miles apart. The two units are located at the sites of former large-scale mines. The Quincy Mining Company property illustrates the processes and technologies of copper mining. The social, ethnic, commercial, and company planned aspects of a mining community are revealed in the village of Calumet and the Calumet & Hecla properties.  Most of the property within the two units is privately owned. Please respect private property. As the park continues to develop, more services and facilities will become available.
