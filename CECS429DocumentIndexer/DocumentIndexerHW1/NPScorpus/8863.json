    "body": "Recreation Vehicles         Motorhome along the road to Twelvemile Beach Campground. NPS photo  \"Recreation vehicles\" come in all shapes and sizes.  With the 2010 completion of the reconstruction and paving of Alger County Road H-58, the interest in touring the park in larger vehicles has increased.  H-58 itself provides for a wonderful scenic drive, suitable for all sizes of motor homes when the road is open in spring, summer and fall. (During the winter, H-58 between the Grand Sable Visitor Center and Kingston Corner is not plowed and serves as a snowmobile trail.) The road is quite curvy in places, so slow down, keep your eyes on the road and enjoy the drive.  However, the national lakeshore's campgrounds and several side roads are not well suited for large RVs and motor homes. Travelers should do their homework and exercise caution before traveling down any of these roads.  The Little Beaver Lake Road (which leads to the Little Beaver Lake Campground) has formal size restrictions. Single units in excess of 36 feet and vehicle\/trailer combinations in excess of 42 feet are prohibited on this road.  For information about the parking pad size in the lakeshore's campgrounds (including photos), please visit the Drive-in Camping page.  Users of large RVs should consider camping at one of the commercial\/municipal campgrounds in the lakeshore's gateway communities of Grand Marais and Munising.        Other sites accessible by large RVs and motor homes Areas within the lakeshore that accommodate large recreation vehicles are limited. The best areas for viewing portions of the park by motor coach include:  Sable Falls - Paved parking - Flush restroom - Trail to waterfall 75 yards plus 100+ steps to lower waterfall platform  Log Slide - Paved parking (RV parking on backside of loop) - Vault toilet - Trail to overlook 150 yards - Wayside exhibits on forests and logging  Lake Superior Overlook - Paved parking - Vault toilet - Viewing platform - Stairway to beach  Miners Castle - Paved parking (use back loop beyond automobile parking) - Flush restroom - Trail to three overlooks - 75 yards, 150 yards, 250 yards lower overlook - Small information center and bookstore - Wayside exhibits on geology, human history, Grand Island  Munising Falls - Paved parking (use farthest RV parking) - Flush restroom - Trail to waterfall viewing platform - 250 yards - Wayside exhibits on historic blast furnace - Small visitor center and bookstore       Lakeshore facilities not well suited for large RVs or motor homes due to limited parking and facilities.
