In the Emerald Necklace in Brookline and Boston, you may come across one of our Photo Safari signs - locations and map below. To participate in the Safari, check out one or more of the ENSafari signs, created by our summer youth team, the Stewards of the Future. Compare the park scenes today with a picture taken by the Olmsted firm over a century ago. You can then either try to capture the view the Olmsteds did, or get creative with your shoot. Then post your photos using #ENSafari and #FindYourPark.                                                           Did you miss the ENSafari signs on August 22nd?
