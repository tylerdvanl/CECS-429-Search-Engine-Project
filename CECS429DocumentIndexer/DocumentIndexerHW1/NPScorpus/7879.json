All connecting trails are blazed in red. Rock Castle Gorge Trail (blazed with green) A moderate to strenuous 10.8 mile loop with elevations ranging from 3,572 feet at Rocky Knob to 1,700 feet at the confluence of Rock Castle and Little Rock Castle Creeks. Parts of the trail are rocky and several sections are quite steep. To avoid the most strenuous uphill sections, hikers can begin at the Rocky Knob Campground and head downhill toward Rock Castle Creek. From the campground, the trail descends over 1,000 feet in 3 miles, passing through a hardwood cove forest of oaks, hickories, tulip trees, basswoods, maples, magnolias and a stand of big tooth aspens. Along the ridge, there is a beautiful display of mountain laurel. This is a good place to look for evidence of old home sites. The 2.8-mile section of trail along Rock Castle Creek follows the gated fire road. Within a half mile, it passes a back-country campground on the site of a former Civilian Conservation Corps complex. A permit for camping is required and may be obtained free from the Rocky Knob Campground, Ranger Station or Visitor Center. Camping in Rock Castle Gorge is permitted only at this designated back-country site. The large white house on the left is privately owned and is not open to the public. After steadily climbing beyond the house, there are excellent views of the creek, 100 feet below. This area has a fabulous display of wildflowers in April and early May. Rock Castle Cascades on the left is a prominent landmark. Turn right at the trail junction where the trail passes through a mesic-hardwood forest. This forest type occurs in ravines and along bases of slopes in the gorge. Here soil is moist, deep and rich. It supports a highly diverse herbaceous layer, as well as unusual cove tree species like black maple. The Rock Castle Gorge Trail gains 875 feet in the next 1.5 miles. After .5 mile, the trail goes through an extensive boulder field known as the Bare Rocks, and a ridge near the rim of the gorge has an impressive stand of Catawba rhododendron and mountain laurel. From Grassy Knoll back to the campground the trail parallels the Parkway and presents views of Rock Castle Gorge, the Piedmont, and the countryside north of Floyd, Virginia. The trail to Rocky Knob is narrow and steep, and affords outstanding views. Just downhill from Rocky Knob, a rustic shelter serves as a reminder that the Appalachian Trail used to pass along this part of the Blue Ridge Parkway before its relocation to the west. Black Ridge Trail (blazed with blue) A moderate 3-mile loop that can be easily accessed from the Rocky Knob Visitor Center. Passing through a second growth forest to a seldom-used gravel road, it includes good views to the north from atop Black Ridge, and then crosses the Parkway to join the Rock Castle Gorge Trail for its return to the visitor center. There are excellent views from this section of trail into Rock Castle Gorge and the Piedmont. Rocky Knob Picnic area Trail (yellow blaze) Aneasy 1-mile loop and offers a pleasant walk through a mature forest of large oaks, ashes, hickories, Fraser magnolias, hemlocks, and other native trees and shrubs. The area is excellent for bird watching, particularly in the nesting season. Smart View Trail Located several miles north of Rocky Knob (Milepost 154.5), the Smart View Trail, is an easy to moderate 2.6-mile loop around the Smart View Picnic area (14.5 miles north of Rocky Knob Visitor Center), offers good views into piedmont Virginia. The trail is level for the most part and is generally dry and smooth underfoot. For most of the 2.6 miles, the trail passes through mature woods and has a good display of wildflowers in April and May. Several signs mark access points from the picnic area to the trail. Allow two hours for this hike. Primitive Camping For the more adventurous, backcountry camping is permitted at the designated site in Rock Castle Gorge. A permit is required and can be obtained by calling the District Ranger Office at (540) 745-9661 or at the campground at Milepost 167. Primitive camping regulations: Camping and campfires are only allowed in designated areas. Only dead firewood may be gathered for fuel. Pack out all trash. Do not use soap or shampoo in any streams. Toilet facilities must be at least 200 feet from water supplies.",
