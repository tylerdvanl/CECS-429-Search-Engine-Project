Less common sightings might include butterflies, praying mantises, or the cicada-killer wasp (Sphecius speciosus). However, with a park emphasis that includes the maintenance of historic structures, Lincoln Home National Historic Site experiences conflicts with the indigenous insect population not present in a natural setting. While perfectly innocuous in their natural habitats, insects like termites, carpenter ants, carpet beetles, silverfish, and the omnipresent cockroach, pose a significant risk to the historic resources. To protect these sensitive and invaluable resources, these threats are monitored and controlled.",
