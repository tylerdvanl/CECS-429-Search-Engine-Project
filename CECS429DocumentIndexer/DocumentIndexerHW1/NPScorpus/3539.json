Before Glen Canyon Dam was built, the Colorado River was so full of silt that only suckers, bonytails, and chubs could survive in its murky waters. While the need to protect these native endangered fish is the highest priority, abundant gamefish now thrive in the clear waters of Lake Powell. Introduced species such as bass and crappie as well as walleye, bluegill, and catfish challenge the avid fisherman. Fishing Information Know the rules and regulations before heading out with your fishing pole. Mercury Advisory Some fish in Lake Powell have high enough mercury levels that we advise that they not be consumed. Non-Native Fish None of the sport fish originated here, but their journey to Lake Powell is fascinating. Endangered Fish The fish that lived here before Glen Canyon Dam was built are being pushed out of their habitat. Take care if you see one. Related Documents: Fish Checklist (99kb pdf)",
