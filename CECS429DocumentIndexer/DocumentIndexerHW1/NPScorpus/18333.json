Children may pick up a program guide at the visitor center and complete walking at least three designated trails and complete five activities. They will then return to the park visitor center to receive an award pin. \"Let's Move Outside\" is a national program to promote activity in the outdoors. Numerous studies have shown that exercise has many health benefits and just being in a natural setting has been shown to lower blood pressure. This program is sponsored by the National Park Foundation, Unilever, and Eastern National. Bring your kids for a walk in the park!",
