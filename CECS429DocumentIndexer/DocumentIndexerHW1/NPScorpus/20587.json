The segment planning approach helps NPS effectively understand the local resources, opportunities, and partner capacities in each segment. The James River segment was the first stretch of the Captain John Smith Chesapeake NHT to undergo segment planning. The National Park Service worked with the James River Association, Chesapeake Conservancy, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Commonwealth of Virginia in a collaborative planning process to identify resources, specific actions, and partnerships required to develop and manage the trail in the segment between Richmond and the Route 17 Bridge, including the free-flowing tidal portion of the Chickahominy River. Five focus areas were identified and a set of strategies developed for enhancing visitor experience along the James River segment of the Trail.
