The collection is a tangible link to the diverse stories through educational programs, research opportunities, and through both virtual and onsite\/offsite exhibition. Images from the museum collection are available on Flickr.  Museum and Archives collections have an important place in the mission of the National Park Service. Nearly every unit of the National Park Service has some form of a museum and archives collection. These collections may include historic objects, natural history specimens, archeology, and archives. Museum and archives collections offer tangible evidence of who we were and who we are as a society. Museum and archives collections are available to the public through exhibitions, web exhibits, and research. For more information about museum collections in the NPS, please click here.  Â    Donations How do I donate my story, archives, and\/or artifacts to the collection? All objects are reviewed prior to full acceptance into the museum and archives collection. For more information on donating your archives, artifacts, and\/or written memories for the collection, email the museum collection staff with information regarding your possible donation.
