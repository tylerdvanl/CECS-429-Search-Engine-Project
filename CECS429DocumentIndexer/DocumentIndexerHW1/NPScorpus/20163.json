Back to top Facilities Historic fort. Visitor center, with bookshop, video and small museum. Seventeen-minute video on the history of Fort Pulaski shown every half-hour. Picnic area. Nature trails. Back to top Food There is a picnic area, with covered tables and rest rooms, in the park. The picnic area is a three- or four-minute drive from the Fort parking lot (or about a 3\/4-mile walk from the parking lot). In order to maintain the historic character of the Fort, picnicking is not allowed inside the Fort. There are no restaurtant facilities in the monument. Back to top Safety The fort is two stories. There are no railings on the upper level. Small children need to be very closely supervised on the upper level of the fort. While much of the fort is under cover, walking from place to place will take your group outside. And even when you are under cover, there is no climate control. So plan on being outdoors. Insects are common at any time of year, depending on the temperature. Back to top Accessibility The first level of the fort (including restrooms) is accessible to wheelchairs, but the top level of the fort is not accessible to wheelchairs. The visitor center and its exhibits are wheelchair-accessible. The picnic area is wheelchair-accessible. Back to top Restrooms There are restrooms inside the historic fort, at the visitor center and at the picnic area. Back to top",
