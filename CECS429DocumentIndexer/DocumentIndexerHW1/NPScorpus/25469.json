The Historic Architecture Program manages the region’s historic structures inventory and prepares Historic American Building Survey (HABS) and Historic American Engineering Record (HAER) projects. The park is home to several historic structures, including Fure's cabin on Naknek Lake and the Fisheries Building at Brooks Camp. A cultural landscape is a geographic area with special natural and cultural significance. Areas that are designated and managed as cultural landscapes are usually associated with an historic event, activity, or person, or have other extraordinary cultural or aesthetic values. Alaska Regional Office staff are currently documenting the cultural landscape of Brooks Camp. Recognizing these special places in the Katmai area helps us preserve and share the region's history.",
