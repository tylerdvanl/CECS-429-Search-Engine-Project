It is the story of the Cold War and how it affected our lives. It is the story of the Air Force's role in the defense of our nation. It is the story of the people of South Dakota and other states who lived alongside military installations...\" - Mr. Tim J. Pavek - testifying for the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site Establishment Act before Congress on September 14, 1999   Minuteman Missile National Historic Site was authorized by Congress in 1999 to preserve Launch Control Facility Delta-01 and Launch Facility (Missile Silo) Delta-09, as nationally significant examples of the Minuteman II missile defense system. The park's mission is to interpret the historical role of that system as a key component of America's strategic commitment to preserve world peace in the broader context of the Cold War. Minuteman Missile must balance the competing demands of its dual mission: providing for a fulfilling visitor experience while protecting and preserving the historic resources located here. Please explore this section for information on statistics and employment, to learn how park staff are planning for the future of the park for our visitors, applicable laws and policies and to learn how the park is preparing for the National Park Service's 100th anniversary in 2016.",
