    "body": "Support Your Park       The Star-Spangled Banner Trail was created to commemorate and protect historical events and places, but its modern-day success depends on how we preserve, protect and use the trail. Getting out on the trail is the first step toward understanding how the Chesapeake Bay region has changed in the last 200 years. We are all responsible for how future generations will experience the region's natural and cultural heritage.  Here are some of the ways you can get involved in the trail today: Experience the Trail  Get out and explore the sights and sounds of the Chesapeake region on the trail's 560 miles of scenic byways, water trails, bicycle routes and hiking trails.  To plan your own itinerary, use My Adventure Planner or download the Chesapeake Explorer App.   Join Others in Restoring the Chesapeake Bay The Bay's future depends on the actions of every person who lives, works and plays in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Simple changes in how we treat our backyards and public spaces can improve the quality of the Bay and its rivers now and for future generations.   Learn some simple tips for helping the Bay from the Chesapeake Bay Program.   Join community action and volunteer projects at your favorite local Bay site.
