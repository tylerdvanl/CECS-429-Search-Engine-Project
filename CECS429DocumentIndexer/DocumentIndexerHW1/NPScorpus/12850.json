    "body": "Explore This Park    Learn About the Park     Nature     Plants               Plants      Whiskeytown is home to a vast array of both vascular (wildflowers, trees, shrubs, grasses, and ferns) and non-vascular (mosses, liverworts, and hornworts) plant species. This diverse assemblage of species is due in part to the park's location within the Klamath Mountian physiographic province and its proximity to the Cascade Mountains, Coast Range, and Sacramento Valley. The park's broad range in elevation, rugged topography, numerous soil types, and history of natural and human disturbance also contribute to its species richness.  The park's many plant communities often intergrade with one another forming indistinct boundaries across the landscape. In general, these communities can be lumped into seven broad categories:      Knobcone Pine    Chaparral    Mixed Oak Woodlands    Blue Oak Grasslands    Ponderosa Pine    Mixed Conifer    Riparian       Â   To learn more about the park's major plant communities, visit our virtual tour.",
