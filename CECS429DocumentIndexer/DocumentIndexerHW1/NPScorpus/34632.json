Limberlost Trail Limberlost Trail (milepost 43) is a circuit hike of 1.3 miles. It passes through forest and a stand of mountain laurel--stunningly beautiful when in blooms in June--and across a boardwalk and bridge. Limberlost Trail is now fully accessible. Since 1996, several organizations have donated labor, equipment, supplies, and funding to help Shenandoah staff make the trail accessible. Recently, Park staff and volunteers adjusted the grade and added benches and over 20 resting areas.
