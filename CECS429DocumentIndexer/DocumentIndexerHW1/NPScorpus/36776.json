We Appreciate your patience and understanding.                 Bryce Canyon offers several day-hiking trails. Because many of these are interconnected, our most popular hikes are combinations of two or more of these basic trails. The hiking trails are divided into three categories of difficulty:   Easy Moderate Strenuous   Keep in mind that all trails below the rim involve steep climbs out of the canyon. Here are a few more hiking reminders;  Wear hiking boots with good \"lug\" traction and ankle support. Carry plenty of water; 1 quart (liter) per 2-3 hours of hiking for each person Park elevations reach over 9,000 feet (2774 meters). Even mild exertion may leave you feeling light-headed and nauseated. Some trails are also shared by horses\/mules April to October. Hikers must yield to horses\/mules. Hiking clockwise reduces your chances of encountering horses\/mules. Stay on maintained trails. DO NOT use \"social\" trails. Be respectful of others; keep noise levels down - no yelling. Do not feed wildlife. Remember, ultimately, you are responsible for your own safety. In winter, Crampons and ski poles are advised for extra grip and support.           Pets Pets are only allowed on paved trails and viewpoints, roads, campsites, and picnic areas. The section of Rim Trail between Sunset and Sunrise Points is open to pets. They must be leashed at all times and you are required to clean up after your pet.

The Riggs Spring Loop Trail (8.8 miles round trip) from Yovimpa Point has four backcountry sites. Both trails drop below the rim of the plateau and lead through forested areas. A backcountry permit is required for all overnight hiking. Permits are available at the Visitor Center. Click Here for detail information and maps. Permits must be obtained in-person and are issued at the park visitor center from 8:00 a.m. until one hour before the Visitor Center closes. No phone or e-mail reservations will be accepted. In-person reservations may be made up to 48 hours in advance. Park staff reserves the right to refuse permits to parties that fail to demonstrate the necessary preparedness that Bryce Canyon's high and dry backcountry demands. Bryce Canyon's backcountry is a primitive area managed according to regulations that protect its wilderness values. Camping is allowed on a limited basis and ONLY at designated campsites. NOTE: Open fires are NOT PERMITTED in Bryce Canyon's backcountry!         LIGHTNING SAFETY Lightning is a year-round danger – especially during summer storms! If you can hear thunder, lightning is within 10 miles (16 km) and you need to seek the shelter of a building or your vehicle immediately. Click Here for more information.",
