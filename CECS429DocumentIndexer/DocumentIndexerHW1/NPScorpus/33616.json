N.P.S.       Purchase items in the park's new Country Store and a percentage of the profits go to support visitor and interpretive programming. The country store represents the many General Stores that once inhabited the lands that are now contained within the park. Some of those stores, such as the General Store on the Taylor Farm, supplied more than food and housewares to area residents. They were a local gathering place for news and gossip. Folks would gather at the store to have their letters read for them or to hear the local news rag read aloud to a crowd.       Items sold in the Visitor Center Country Store include National Park-themed items, park T-shirts, nature instruction books and guides, and items relating to the 1930s and 40s.           Eastern National is the Prince William Forest Park's cooperating association. They operate the General Store in the park visitor center to broaden the public's understanding of the park and its stories. Eastern National donates a portion of the store proceeds to visitor services and interpretation projects. They also help the park provide publications that it couldn't otherwise. Visit the Eastern National webpage for more information on their partnership with the National Park Service and to shop online.        The cover of Prince William Forest Park: Where History and Nature Unite.
