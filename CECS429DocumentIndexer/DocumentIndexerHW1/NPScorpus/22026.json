Official News Release      Hovercraft remain prohibited in all Alaska National Parks and Preserves As the boating and hunting seasons get underway in Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve and other areas with the National Park System in Alaska, visitors are reminded that a recent court case has not changed the regulations which prohibit hovercraft on navigable waters. In March, the Supreme Court unanimously decided to return the case of Sturgeon v. Frost to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.Because the court did not invalidate any of the current NPS regulations, the regulation on hovercraft and others remain in effect until a court rules otherwise.More information on the Court's March 22, 2016 decision can be found at: http:\/\/www.supremecourt.gov\/opinions\/15pdf\/14-1209_kifl.pdf Official News Release      Proposed Herbicide Treatments Targeting Invasive Plants.
