    "body": "Online Curriculum - Identification (Unit 4)         Basic morphology of an aspen leaf.   Leaves are good indicators of climatic conditions in terrestrial environments. Their shape and the patterns that their veins and edges form provide important information about the environment in which they lived. Let's take a moment to familiarize ourselves with leaf identification. You can also download a printable PDF version of each of these identification guide pages to help you complete the exercise. Basic Leaf Terminology  Lamina - the expanded, flat part of a leaf or leaflet. Apex - usually the upper ~25% of the lamina. Base - usually the lower ~25% of the lamina. Margin - the edge of the lamina. Petitole - the stalk of the leaf. Primary vein - the widest vein of the leaf and any others of like width and\/or course. Secondary veins - the next widest class of veins after the primary, originating from the primary or primaries.
