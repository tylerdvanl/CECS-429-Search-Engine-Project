    "body": "People       There have been people shaping the history of the Outer Banks for hundreds of years. Some like the Native Americans and the everyday Bankers lived their lives and passed into the mists of time leaving behind place names and local industries such as fishing. Others like the lightkeepers and surfmen have stood out and made their presence known to the point where history vividly remembers their deeds. Finally, others such as Billy Mitchell and Reginald Fessenden not only impacted the local area but also helped change the world through the experiments they conducted on the seashoreâ€™s islands. Though many of these people have passed on, leaving names, memories, and stories, their impact will continue to influence the area. In time, others will come add their mark on the heritage of the Outer Banks.",
