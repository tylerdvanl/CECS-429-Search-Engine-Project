Species of special concern that occur within the park include the common map turtle, eastern river cooter, broadhead skink, eastern worm snake, and rough green snake. Fence lizards, five-lined skinks, black rat snakes, garter snakes, ringneck snakes, copperheads, and eastern box turtles are all commonly seen throughout the park.  Hikers will occasionally encounter a copperhead or timber rattlesnake, the two venomous snakes found in the park. They are not normally aggressive if you keep away and give them a chance to escape.
