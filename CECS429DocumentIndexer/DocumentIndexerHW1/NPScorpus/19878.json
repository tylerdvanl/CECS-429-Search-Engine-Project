The Creeks (prominently the Yamacraw tribe) favored British over Spanish interests, and were instrumental in aiding Oglethorpe's new settlement of Georgia.  The following links contain these stories:         John Worth’s “Georgia before Oglethorpe” When plagues and slave raids destroyed early chiefdoms, Spain and England conducted war by proxy for this land. Anthropologist John Worth's site has several chapters to explore.         Spanish Missions in Georgia From New Georgia Encyclopedia Online The Spanish chapter of Georgia's earliest history is the mission era, from 1568 - 1684. Catholic missions were used to assimulate Georgia's native chiefdoms into the Spanish colonial system on the frontier of Spanish Florida.         Tomochichi (ca. 1644-1739) From New Georgia Encyclopedia Online This chief of the Yamacraw Indians, is a prominent character of early Georgia history. He served as the principal mediator between the native population and the new English settlers during the first years of settlement.         Mary Musgrove (ca. 1700-ca. 1763) From New Georgia Encyclopedia Online Coosaponakeesa (Creek name) served as a liaison between colonial Georgia and her Native American community in the mid-18th century. Used her status to promote Creek interests and expand trade.         Native Americans in the \"Trustees of Georgia\" Painting Discussion paper by Donald Panther-Yates In Verelst's work, the Georgia Trustees were identified by the painter, but the visiting natives depicted were not.
