National Park Service, Weir Farm National Historic Site       Thank you for your interest in supporting Weir Farm National Historic Site. There are several ways to support the park:            Volunteer The National Park Service Volunteers-In-Parks Program (VIP) was authorized by Public Law 91-357 enacted 1970. The VIP program provides a vehicle through which the National Park Service can accept and utilize voluntary help and services from the public. The major objective of the program is to utilize this voluntary help in such a way that is mutually beneficial to the National Park Service and the volunteer. Volunteers are accepted from the public without regard to race, creed, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, or disability.           Donate The park may accept donations from individuals, families, organizations, foundations, corporations, businesses, associations and other entities. Your contribution will be used to acquire art historically associated with the site and support the preservation and programs of the only national park in the country dedicated to American painting. No other federal agency relies as heavily on the generosity and kindness of its visitors, and we thank you for your past support and look forward to future cooperation.           Cooperating Association Eastern National runs Weir Farm National Historic Site's museum store. They are a 501(c)3 non-profit cooperating association, operating in more than 150 national parks and other public trusts. They are dedicated to the preservation and use of the parks for the benefit of all Americans, visitors from all nations and future generations.",
