It is acknowledged as the premier Wilderness park in the national park system and serves as the headwaters for six Wild Rivers.  It protects a functioning arctic, mountain ecosystem in its entirety and provides habitat of world importance for naturally occurring plant and animal populations.In consultation with local rural residents Gates of the Arctic protects habitats and resources to provide subsistence opportunities on lands that have supported traditional cultures and local residents.  While the park provides visitors with opportunities for solitude and challenging wilderness adventures within a remote and vast arctic landscape, it also preserves and supports a 12,000-year record of human cultural adaptations to high latitude mountain environments and an unbroken tradition of living on the land. While it may seem untouched, you are not the first one to travel here. That said, traveling in a remote wilderness park requires visitors to be self sufficient and flexible. You're on your own. This is the number one message preserve visitors must know and apply to their visit to Gates of the Arctic. There is no cell phone service and there are no amenities or services in the preserve.
