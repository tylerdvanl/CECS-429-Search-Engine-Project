Few ships or aircraft pass to disturb the natural tranquility. Occasionally military or Coast Guard helicopters fly low over the beach, but these disappear quickly. The only major sources of noise are the vehicles and infrequent portable stereos of visitors near the Malaquite Visitors Center. Few of these venture farther than a few miles south of the end of the park road at the entrance to South Beach.",
