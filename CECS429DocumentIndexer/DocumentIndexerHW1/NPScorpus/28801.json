    "body": "Living History Programs       Living History programs are a different way of experiencing a National Park. These programs allow you to \"step back in time\" to a lost era and learn with someone from the past.  Steamtown offers four Living History Programs, including: a depression-era hobo, a World War II Military Policeman protecting the vital transportation network, a Mail Clerk serving on a Railway Post Office car, and a 1920s Yard Worker. To learn about the Living History Programs that may be available during your visit, visit our Guided Tours page. Due to staffing and equipment availability, the Guided Tours page is updated on a monthly basis, with each month's schedule posted about a week before the start of the month.",
