Please call us at 301-344-3944 to sign up.  Come and help Greenbelt Park. Join us each first Saturday of the month to help remove invasive plants from the park. This partnership with the University of Maryland involves identifying and removing different invasive plants in the park. This hands-on volunteer project is going strong thanks to Volunteer Leader Tom Crone.  Thanks to the efforts of volunteers and the University of Maryland students, Greenbelt Park is preserving the park for future generations.  It is not a difficult or dangerous task. Please bring insect and\/or tick repellant.  Our volunteer leader will teach and show the invasive plants to be removed. This is time consuming and numerous hands are needed.  Thanks to this project and the many volunteers, Greenbelt Park is a prime example of removing invasives before they can take over and destroy the native plants. Participants meet at the Sweetgum Picnic Area at 11:00 a.m. on the first Saturday of each month. Large groups, please call ahead at 301-344-3944.  2016 Saturday February 6 Saturday March 5 Saturday April 2 Saturday May 7 Saturday June 4 Saturday July 2 Saturday August 6 Saturday September 3 Saturday October 1 Saturday November 5 Saturday December 3",
