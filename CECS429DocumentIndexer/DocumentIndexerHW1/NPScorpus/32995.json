By 1890 Naturalist John Muir, Washington Congressman James Wickersham, and Lieutenant Joseph O'Neil, who led the first well-documented exploration of the peninsula's interior, each respectively proposed creation of a national park on the Olympic Peninsula.          Click here to learn more about exploration of the Olympic Peninsula   In 1897 the area received its first national designation, as Olympic Forest Reserve, by President Grover Cleveland in response to concern about the area's disappearing forests.

An additional area of Pacific coast was added in 1953.        World Heritage Site dedication   Olympic National Park's outstanding attributes have also led to international recogn­ition. In 1976 the park was designated an International Biosphere Reserve in the Man and the Biosphere Program by United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). International recognition came again in 1981 when the park was declared a World Heritage Site by the World Heritage Convention, joining it to a system of natural and cultural properties that are considered irreplaceable treasures of outstanding universal value.          Click here to learn more about tribes of the Olympic Peninsula   Local communities are closely and directly linked to the park in culture, heritage, and tradition, and also provide important historical information and meaning to the park's landscape.
