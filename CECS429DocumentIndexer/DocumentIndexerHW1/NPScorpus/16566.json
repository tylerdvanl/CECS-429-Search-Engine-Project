NPS\/Peaco  Xanterra Parks & Resorts offers horse rides of one and two hours in length which are available at Tower-Roosevelt and Canyon. Advance reservations are recommended. In addition, they also offer horseback or wagon rides which take visitors to a cookout site for a steak dinner. Advance reservations are required; call (307) 344-7311 or 866-439-7375. TDD service (Telecommunications Device for the Deaf) is available at 307-344-5395. Online reservations are not available at this time. Guided stock trips into the backcountry (horse or llama) may be arranged with one of the stock outfitters licensed to operate in Yellowstone. Private stock can be brought into the park. Overnight stock use is not permitted prior to July 1, due to range readiness and\/or wet trail conditions. Horses are not allowed in frontcountry campgrounds, but are permitted in certain backcountry campsites. For information on planning a backcountry trip with stock please see the online Backcountry Trip Planner or call the Backcountry Office at (307) 344-2160.
