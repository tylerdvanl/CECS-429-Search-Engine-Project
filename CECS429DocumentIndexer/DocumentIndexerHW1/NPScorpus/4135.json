    "body": "South Florida Collections Management Center       The South Florida Collections Management Center (SFCMC) manages the museum collections for Big Cypress National Preserve, Biscayne National Park, De Soto National Memorial, Dry Tortugas National Park, and Everglades National Park. Combined, the museum collections from these five parks comprise over 6 million objects, archival documents, and specimens. The SFCMC is the central museum service provider for these five south Florida NPS units, functioning as an integral part of each park's operations and programs. It provides high-quality, professional museum collection management services, ensuring preservation and accessibility in the most responsive, efficient and cost-effective manner. The mission of the South Florida Collections Management Center is:  to collect, document and make accessible appropriate objects, specimens and archival material, while ensuring their preservation for future generations;  to preserve, document and support scientific research related to the units' cultural and natural resources; to support, facilitate and remain responsive to the museum needs of the south Florida units; to educate the public by documenting and supporting the units' interpretive programs and resource themes; to contribute to the scientific body of data through research, accessibility, and dissemination of information; and  to document and preserve the administrative history associated with the management of the units and preservation of their resources.   The SFCMC staff coordinates cataloging and preservation of specimens and data collected under research permits in the south Florida parks. All specimens collected inside the parks are the property of the US Government and become part of the museum collection. All collectors have curatorial responsibilities for the specimens and data collected. Finding aids are available for selected collections in the museum archives. Cataloging of the collections is still in progress. Museum collections are available to legitimate researchers for study, per the museum access and use policy. Researchers interested in learning more about the SFCMC collections should contact the Museum Curator by telephone at 305-242-7826; or for archival research contact the Archivist by e-mail or telephone at 305-242-7804.",
