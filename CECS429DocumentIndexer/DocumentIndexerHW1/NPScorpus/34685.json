    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Operating Hours & Seasons              Operating Hours & Seasons      Shenandoah National Park is always open. However, portions of Skyline Drive, the only public road through the park, are periodically closed during inclement weather and at night during deer hunting season, mid-November through early January. Visitors can still enter the park on foot to hike even when the Drive is closed. Current facilities schedule. Most visitor facilities and services begin operating in March and close down completely in late November.  Lodging and restaurant facilities are operated by Delaware North at Shenandoah National Park, the park's official concessionaire. There are several campgrounds and picnic grounds throughout the park. Visitor Centers offer exhibits, videos, park bookstores, and general information about Shenandoah National Park. For more information call the park's recorded information line: (540) 999-3500 SeasonsFour distinct seasons make Shenandoah a new and exciting place to be each and every month.  Although best known for its vibrant fall foliage, the park is no less spectacular (and a lot less crowded) in spring when the wildflowers and trees are in full bloom. Summer brings lush greens and welcome relief from the valley temperatures. The park's elevation encourages as much as a 10 degree difference. That same difference can bring dramatic changes in winter. When surrounding lowlands are experiencing rain, the park can be blanketed in snow and ice. But the clear skies and bare trees of winter make the park's vistas magnificent and wildlife tracking and viewing particularly rewarding. It's always a good idea to be prepared for changing weather if you're planning to visit Shenandoah. Wear layers in the winter and remember that facilities are closed. In summer, check the weather forecast for lightning before heading out and always bring plenty of water.",
