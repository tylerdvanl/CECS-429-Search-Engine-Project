Over two hundred years later, visitors can retrace the Expedition's path by following the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail. Among the more than 100 sites along the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, only five are National Park Service sites. Today's Trail is the product of many diverse groups: federal, tribal, state and local agencies, and public and private organizations. These groups work together across more than 3700 miles of the Trail to provide opportunities for visitors to experience and learn about the Lewis and Clark Expedition and its many stories.
