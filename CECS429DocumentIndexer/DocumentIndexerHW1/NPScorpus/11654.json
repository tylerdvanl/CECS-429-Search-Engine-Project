Point Reyes is host to 13 species of ferns from six different fern families. Ferns are by far the largest group of living seedless vascular plants. Vascular plants have stems, roots, leaves, and vascular systems that transport water, minerals, and food. Other seedless vascular plants include horsetails and club mosses. Ferns have a worldwide distribution on all continents except Antarctica and most islands. Keep your eye out for ferns along creek banks and in moist places; you’ll be rewarded with views of the delicate five-finger fern, California maiden-hair, wood fern, bracken, and more.View Fern and Fern Allies of Point Reyes species list (9 KB PDF, Adobe® Acrobat Reader® required)",
