One of the easiest and most rewarding is to volunteer. Each year people across the country donate millions of hours to protect and preserve our National Parks. Interested? Just contact the park at (270) 358-3137 or e-mail us If you are interested in volunteering at another park go to: http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/volunteer      Leave No Trace   What is Leave No Trace?  Leave No Trace (LNT) is about attitude and ethics. It’s about taking personal responsibility to respect and care for our limited wildland resources and the experiences of other outdoor enthusiasts. Low-impact skills and knowledge are also an important part of LNT, but without the right attitude and ethic, they are useless. You must commit yourself to apply them, to practice good stewardship.       Interagency Pass Program The new Interagency Pass Program combines the benefits of existing recreation passes from five Federal agencies into one comprehensive pass. For additional information or to purchase a pass go to http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/fees_passes.htm or stop by any National Park Site or other federal land agencies that charges an entrance fee.",
