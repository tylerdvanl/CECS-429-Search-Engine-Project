    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit           Plan Your Visit      For centuries, people have lived along the Alagnak and depended on its rich natural resources for survival. Given the lack of services along the corridor, visitors to the Alagnak today should also plan on being self-sufficient. For the prepared visitor, it is these very characteristics that can make for the adventure of a lifetime. Visitors are encouraged to (and should expect to) invest a significant amount of time and energy in planning their visit. For more information, contact Alagnak Wild River headquarters in King Salmon, AK. The King Salmon Visitor Center, in partnership with Alaska Geographic, offers maps, books, and other useful trip planning literature.",
