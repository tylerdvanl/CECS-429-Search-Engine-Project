    "body": "Planning       Park planning begins with you. Director's Order #75A on Civic Engagement and Public Involvement sets forth the policy commitment of the National Park Service to civic engagement and describes the distinctions between civic engagement and public involvement. More specifically, civic engagement is about creating, facilitating, and maintaining relationships with communities of interest, both near and far. Click here to learn more. The National Park Service prepares a variety of planning and environmental documents to help guide it in managing park resources such as our park Foundation Document. These documents can range from site-specific impact analyses on facility locations to broader park-wide plans for future use and management of a park. Current park planning efforts include:  Kingsley Plantation - Ribault Club Interpretive Tram Tour   Environmental Assessment for Seawall at St. Johns Bluff  Visit the Planning, Environment, and Public Comment (PEPC) site to review and remark on those projects within the preserve available for comment.",
