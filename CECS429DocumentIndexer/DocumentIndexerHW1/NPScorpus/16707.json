The historic site recognizes the destructive effect gun violence has had on park neighbors with the recent shooting at Mo's Express. The vigil will also provide an opportunity for park staff to honor the memory of National Park Service Ranger Margaret Anderson, who died in the line of duty on New Year's Day. Anderson was shot to death at Mount Rainier National Park as she attempted to stop her eventual killer from proceeding into a crowded park with multiple firearms. These two tragic events are sad reminders that gun violence can affect any community and any neighborhood. January 8 also marks the one-year anniversary of the shooting of Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and others in a Tucson area shopping center that resulted in six deaths.

Elliott,the lawsuit would later become one of the five cases brought before the U.S. Supreme Court under the name Brown v. Board of Education.The watershed decision ruled that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional and initiated massive changes in race relations.

Moton High School in Farmville, Virginia. Protesting the dismal conditions of segregated schools, the student strike lasted two weeks and resulted in a lawsuit that would become one of the five cases heard by the U.S. Supreme Court as part of Brown v. Board of Education. In defiance of the court order to desegregate, Prince Edward County, Virginia closed its public school system for five years, leaving 1700 African American students without public education. Three plaintiffs from the Davis v. Prince Edward County case will share their experiences and memories of the 13 year struggle for equal education in a free public program at Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site at 3 p.m. on Sunday, February 27. The free public program will begin with a screening of the documentary film, Farmville: An American Story. Following the screening, case plaintiffs Joy Speaks, John Watson, and Joan Johns Cobbs will speak about their involvement in the historic case and its effects on the local community. The participants will be joined by Dr. Terence Hicks for a panel discussion and question and answer session. Himself a graduate of Prince Edward County High School, Dr. Hicks is also an associate professor of research in the Department of Educational Leadership at Fayetteville State University in North Carolina. He is co-editor of The Educational Lockout of African Americans in Prince Edward County, Virginia (1959-1964). Books will be for sale and available for signing by program participants immediately following the program. To RSVP by February 25, please e-mail the Brown Foundation by clicking here or call (785) 235-3939. Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County is unique among the five lawsuits heard by the U.S. Supreme Court as part of Brown v. Board of Education. The case was the only one initiated by students. The struggle for equal education in Prince Edward County unfolded over thirteen years: from the student walkout in 1951, to the landmark Brown decision declaring segregation unconstitutional in 1954, to Prince Edward County's five year school closure beginning in 1959, to the re-opening of the public school system in 1964. The closure of the county's schools was part of the South's \"Massive Resistance\" to court ordered desegregation and drew attention from across the nation. In a speech commemorating the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation in 1963, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy eloquently stated, \"We may observe with much sadness and irony that, outside of Africa, south of the Sahara, where education is still a difficult challenge, the only places on earth not to provide free public education are Communist China, North Vietnam, Sarawak, Singapore, British Honduras and Prince Edward County, Virginia. Something must be done about Prince Edward County.\" This program is co-sponsored by Brown v.

In Celebration of Women's History Month Park Features Quilt Exhibit and Dramatic Play, The Hillsboro Story 　 Release date: February 28, 2011 Contact: Justin Sochacki Phone number: (785) 354-4273 Topeka, KS – In celebration of Women's History Month, Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site will feature two exciting public programs. On display beginning March 1 is Sankofa: Lessons Learned, a spectacular exhibition of quilts created by local quilt artist, Marla Jackson. In commemoration of the 55th anniversary of the Hillsboro, Ohio desegregation case, the park will also host a performance of the dramatic play, The Hillsboro Story at 3 p.m. on Sunday, March 6. All programs are free and open to the public and will take place at Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site. From March 1- March 30, the park will feature Sankofa: Lessons Learned. Each of the sixteen quilts on display represents women as they move through their lives, learning lessons of joy, loss, family, and love. Originally from Royal Oak Township in Michigan, Jackson spent many weekends and summers with her paternal grandparents, Rufus and Zelma Crum and her formerly enslaved great-grandmother, Lucille Crum. Her artistic direction was influenced by her family's stories, and her quilts depict scenes and themes that capture the pride, spirit, pain, and joy of the African American experience. The primary goal of her work is to reveal the untold stories of heroes that history has overlooked, forgotten, or hidden. The exhibit is free and open to the public daily from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. and will also be open for the First Friday Art Walk on March 4, from 5:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. The Hillsboro Story is a powerful drama that opens in Hillsboro, Ohio on July 5, 1954 when the town's segregated elementary school erupts into flames. Despite an 1887 law outlawing segregated schools in Ohio, the Hillsboro school board created a segregated school when it transferred all African American students in the integrated Webster School to Lincoln Elementary School in 1939. With the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, parents assumed their children would be able to attend the all-white Webster and Washington schools. When the school board resisted integration, one man set fire to the all-black Lincoln school, in hopes of hastening an end to segregation. The action sparks a two-year battle resulting in Clemons v. Hillsboro Board of Education. Playwright Susan Banyas was a third-grader in Hillsboro when this powerful story began to unfold. Her play weaves together spoken word, movement, monologue, and visual imagery that is culled from historical research and interviews with individuals at the center of the story. Seating is limited for this performance. Please RSVP by March 4 via email by clicking here or by calling (785) 235-3939. Programs are co-sponsored by Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site and the Brown Foundation for Educational, Equity, Excellence, and Research and are part of the 2010-2011 program series titled Commemorating Our Nation's Struggle for Freedom: From Civil War to Civil Rights.

Board of Education National Historic Site for the staging of a dramatic play entitled The Hillsboro Story. At the conclusion of the 90-minute play, the cast and playwright facilitated a 45-minute talkback session, allowing audience members to ask questions about The Hillsboro Story and share their own thoughts on race, education, and history in their own lives and communities. The play opens in Hillsboro, Ohio on July 5, 1954 when the small town's segregated all-black elementary school erupts in flames. Despite an 1887 law outlawing segregated education in the state of Ohio, the Hillsboro school board created a segregated system in 1939 when it transferred all African American students from the integrated Webster Elementary School to the predominantly black Lincoln Elementary School. When the U.S. Supreme Court struck down segregated public schools in Brown v. Board of Education, parents in Hillsboro assumed that children would be able to attend the school closest to their home. When the school board failed to integrate, local resident Philip Partridge set fire to the all-black Lincoln School in an attempt to hasten the process. The continued delays on the part of the school board and the conviction and imprisonment of Partridge sparked a two-year struggle that saw the organization of the Marching Mothers, peaceful demonstrations, and the creation of home and church schooling program for African American children. In 1956, the courts decreed in Clemons v. Hillsboro Board of Education that any child not in public school be granted immediate admittance on a non-segregated basis. Playwright Susan Banyas was a third grader in Hillsboro and remembers these actions literally taking place outside her classroom window. Most of the text for The Hillsboro Story was developed from more than 50 interviews conducted in the last six years with the primary participants in the event, their families and friends, and from national voices representing the civil rights movement. The dramatic recreation of this piece of Ohio history powerfully illustrates both the local and national impacts of the Brown decision. The lively talkback session took a dramatic turn even for the cast and playwright, when they learned that sitting in the front row were Leola Brown Montgomery and Linda Brown Thompson, the wife and daughter of the case's namesake, Oliver Brown. The Hillsboro Story continued on a Midwestern tour, which included stops at Hillsboro Middle and High Schools and the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati, Ohio.      Civil War Symposium to Feature Four Renowned Civil War Historians Release date: March 20, 2011 Contact: Justin Sochacki Phone number: (785) 354-4273 Topeka, KS –The 150th anniversary of the Civil War will be commemorated across the nation from 2011-2015.

Board of Education National Historic Site in Topeka, Kan. This new assignment takes effect July 3.    \"David is an ideal selection for this leadership position at Brown v. Board,\" said George J. Turnbull, acting director for the NPS 13-state Midwest Region. \"The breadth of David's park experience, as well as his service to Congress and in the NPS Washington, D.C., Office as a Bevinetto Congressional Fellow will serve him very well,\" he added.

What an honor to be entrusted with this story and to be able to share it with the next generation of Americans.\" Born and raised in San Diego, Calif., Smith graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1990, earning his Bachelor of Arts degree in Development Studies. During his time at the Grand Canyon, he completed his Masters of Science in Resource Interpretation at the Stephen F. Austin University.

Board of Education Date: May 5, 2011 Contact: Justin Sochacki Phone: (785) 354-4273 Topeka, KS – A new exhibit entitled Argument: The Attorneys of Brown v. Board of Education is now open at Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site. The exhibit presents the stories and viewpoints of the trial attorneys who argued their cases in what would be one of the most transformative U.S. Supreme Court decisions in American history. The exhibit is free and open to the public daily at Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site through May 30. Representing parents and students in four states and the District of Columbia, a team of dedicated African American and white lawyers attacked segregation in public schools and the institution of segregation itself. While the Brown decision did not immediately end segregation in the nation's public schools, the ruling was a powerful symbol of using law for social change. The case inspired and provided a model for generations of future lawyers in the civil rights movement. On the opposite side of the courtroom, lawyers defended the segregation laws of their states and districts. Some defenders of segregation were renowned attorneys and politicians, while others like Kansas Assistant Attorney General Paul E. Wilson were making their first appearance before the nation's highest court. The exhibit was created by Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site staff and commemorates the 60th anniversary of the filing of the Brown v. Board of Education lawsuit in Topeka. The exhibit is part of the 2010-2011 program series titled Commemorating Our Nation's Struggle for Freedom: From Civil War to Civil Rights.

NPS\\Cheryl DeShazer  Forging Freedom's Pathway Date: June 24, 2011 On June 11, visitors leisurely strolled five blocks with uniformed park rangers from the historic Ritchie House to the formerly segregated Monroe Elementary School, meeting six costumed reenactors along the way. Beginning at the home of prominent abolitionists and operators on the Underground Railroad and ending at a formerly segregated elementary school, visitors walked symbolically through time from the birth of the Civil War to the birth of the civil rights movement. Operated by the Shawnee County Historical Society, the Ritchie House was home to John and Mary Jane Ritchie, early settlers of Topeka who immigrated to Kansas Territory in 1855 to aid the free state cause. The Ritchies were comrades of John Brown and active in the Underground Railroad. After the Civil War the Ritchies gave away and sold land to African Americans seeking a new start in Kansas. This led to a predominantly black neighborhood that came to be known as Ritchie's Addition. Built in 1926 as part of a massive school expansion project, the Monroe Elementary school was built on land once donated by Ritchie. Monroe was one of the four African American elementary schools operating in Topeka in 1951 when the Brown v. Board of Education lawsuit was filed. The restored school now serves as the visitor center for the national historic site. Beginning with abolitionist Mary Jane Ritchie in 1854, visitors met six characters that portrayed evolving views of race and freedom in Kansas. Other characters included David Rice Atchison, a pro-slavery Senator from Missouri; Clarina Nichols, an abolitionist and women's suffrage activist; Nathan Holder, an African American Civil War veteran and Topeka resident in the 1880s; and Chester Woodward, a member of the Topeka Board of Education in 1930. The concluding character, portrayed by Ranger Joan Wilson, was Julia Roundtree, an African American educator and activist in Topeka who discussed the lawsuit filed in 1951 that would end legal segregation. Though visitation was not as high as hoped, the event received excellent coverage by local print, radio, and television. Local PBS affiliate KTWU was onsite and is producing a segment for their popular program, Sunflower Journeys, to air later this year. The segment will focus on the story of Julia Roundtree. The program was a cooperative effort by the National Park Service, the Shawnee County Historical Society, the Lecompton Reenactors, and Western National Parks Association. Period Civil War music was provided by the Kaw Valley Cornet Band and an acoustic trio featuring park staff and volunteers provided Civil War and Civil Rights era music. Park rangers from Harry S Truman NHS and Tallgrass Prairie NP also provided assistance before and during the event.             Topeka Connection to Tulsa Race Riots of 1921 Remembered in Free Public Program Release date: July 12, 2011 Contact: Justin Sochacki Phone number: (785) 354-4273 Topeka, KS - Ninety years ago, a violent race riot in Tulsa, Oklahoma ended with the deaths of nearly 300 African Americans and left thousands homeless when the Greenwood neighborhood was burned to the ground. Victims received no compensation for their losses. African American attorneys, like Topeka's Elisha Scott, worked on behalf of victims who lost homes and relatives. A documentary film entitled The Tulsa Lynching of 1921: A Hidden Story will be shown, followed by a discussion of Elisha Scott's efforts to assist riot victims, at 3 p.m. on Sunday, July 17 at Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site. The program is free and open to the public. Please RSVP to the Brown Foundation by July 15 by clicking here or calling (785) 235-3939. The Tulsa Lynching of 1921: A Hidden Story was produced, written, and directed by Michael Wilkerson and initially released in May 2000. The film includes interviews with survivors of the riot and the continuing struggle for compensation. Following the film, National Park Service historian Thom Rosenblum will discuss the role of African American attorney Elisha Scott of Topeka in seeking justice for African Americans who lost homes and loved ones. Elisha Scott also argued numerous cases to end segregation in public schools. His two sons, Charles and John Scott, were lawyers in the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case. Rosenblum is currently writing a book on the Scott family lawyers and their civil rights legacy. The film screening and discussion are cosponsored by the National Park Service and the Brown Foundation for Educational Equity, Excellence and Research and is part of the 2010-2011 program series entitled Commemorating Our Nation's Struggle for Freedom: From Civil War to Civil Rights.
