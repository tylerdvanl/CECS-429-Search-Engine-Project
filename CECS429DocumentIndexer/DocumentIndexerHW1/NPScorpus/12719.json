The fire was finally contained 99 days later on November 6 and was declared out in the month that followed. At one point, there were over 3,700 fire personnel assigned and the fire grew over 10,000 acres per day.  Along with support from staff and volunteers, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks created an interactive map to share the story of the Rough Fire.  The interactive map is a way that the public can learn and share the story of the Rough Fire. As users click through the days, they can see pictures from the fire and see a map showing how the fire grew over the course of 99 days.   View full screen.",
