    "body": "Laws & Policies       FIREARMS As of February 22, 2010, a new federal law allows people who can legally possess firearms under applicable federal, state, and local laws, to legally possess firearms in Devils Postpile National Monument. It is the responsibility of visitors to understand and comply with all applicable state, local, and federal firearms laws before entering this park. As a starting point, please visit the California Attorney General's Website. Federal law also prohibits firearms in federal facilities including the Devils Postpile Ranger Station. Facilities will be marked with signs at all public entrances.      UNMANNED AIRCRAFT Launching, landing, or operating an unmanned aircraft from or on lands and waters administered by the National Park Service within the boundaries of Devils Postpile National Monument is prohibited except as approved in writing by the Superintendent.    This restriction is to protect the public from hazards and preserve the monument's natural, aesthetic, an scenic values. The use of unmanned aircraft potentially presents unacceptable risks to visitors (collisions between unmanned aircraft and visitors, the uncontrolled fall of unmanned aircraft, contact with spinning propellers or rotors of unmanned aircraft). The use of unmanned aircraft adversely impacts the visitor experience.      SUPERINTENDENT'S COMPENDIUM For monument specific rules and regulations, check out the Superintendent's Compendium.
