Fire Island is without a doubt one of the best birding locations in the New York area, particularly during the spring and fall migrations. Located along the Atlantic migratory flyway, Fire Island plays host to a wide variety of both migratory and resident bird species. The island's rich mosaic of forest, dune, and marsh habitats offers feeding and nesting opportunities for a wide array of shorebirds, songbirds, raptors, waterfowl, and waders. Fire Island National Seashore is one of more than 40 National Park Service sites that are recognized as \"Globally Important Bird Areas\" by conservation organizations. The Seashore's Atlantic coastline is a part of the American Bird Conservancy's designated Long Island Piping Plover Nesting Beaches.      Learn More  Birds of Fire Island  Checklist Migratory Birds in National Parks Migration of Birds (USGS publication) Threatened and Endangered Species Birdwatching in the National Parks Birdwatching at Fire Island National Seashore       You can watch the fall migration of raptors (hawks, etc.), viewed from the raptor-viewing platform (just east of Robert Moses State Park, Field 5). The Fire Island Raptor Enumerators (FIRE) is a group of dedicated individuals who collect data and keep records on the numbers of raptors and their flight patterns in this region. Raptors tend to fly in a pattern across the island near the raptor-viewing platform.",
