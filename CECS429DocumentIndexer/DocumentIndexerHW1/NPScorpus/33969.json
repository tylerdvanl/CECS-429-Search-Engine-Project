    "body": "Virtual Tour Stop, Chewning Farm        On the high plateau in the background of this photo lay the Chewning Farm, another small farm dotting the Wilderness landscape. The farm stood on key ground between General Richard Ewell's Confederates on the Orange Turnpike and General A.P. Hill's Southerners on the Orange Plank Road.         A dirt lane leads from the parking area to the site of the Chewning House and plateau.         On the morning of May 5, General Samuel Crawford's Union division followed the Parker's Store Road southwesterly onto the Chewning Plateau. They looked down upon General A.P. Hill's Corps advancing eastward on the Orange Plank Road. Instead of slamming into Hill's column or fortifying this key ground, Crawford's men were recalled to support the attacks on the Orange Turnpike.         Confederates of A.P. Hill's Corps later occupied the Chewning Plateau, but were soon directed to reinforce Hill's men on the Orange Plank Road. On May 6, General Ambrose Burnside's Corps was ordered to retake this key ground, but were unable to do so.           Coninue to Virtual Tour Stop, Tapp Field",
