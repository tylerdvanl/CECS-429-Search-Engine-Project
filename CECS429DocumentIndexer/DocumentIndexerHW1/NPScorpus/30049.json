Completed in 1858 near the site of its 1826 predecessor, the current Fire Island Light is still a beacon attracting thousands of people each year. With a focal plane of 168 feet above the level of the sea, can be seen more than 20 miles away. Accessible Year-Round by Car (Take Robert Moses Parkway) The Fire Island Lighthouse is on the western part of Fire Island National Seashore, adjacent to Robert Moses State Park. The Fire Island Lighthouse area offers exhibits, a nature trail, interpretive programs and curriculum-based fourth grade education programs (school groups by reservation only). There is walking access to the Lighthouse Beach (no lifeguards). The Fire Island Lighthouse is operated by the Fire Island Lighthouse Preservation Society under a cooperative agreement with the National Park Service. The light, still owned by the United States Coast Guard, is now maintained and operated by the Society as a private aid to navigation.
