NPS photo       The very first suggestion of a \"nation's park\" came from artist George Catlin in 1832. Artists have always played a vital role in preserving our nation's treasures. Catoctin Mountain Park, Cunningham Falls State Park and the Catoctin Forest Alliance, Inc. (CFA) support this tradition today through the Artist-In-Residence program. Artists help our national parks with their root mission: conservation and enjoyment. Historic records and technical drawings may help preserve the nuts and bolts of a national park, while the hand of an artist will preserve the park's soul. The artist's work draws the public closer to the park's resources, so that they enjoy it on a deeper level and help to preserve it. Mission Statement: The Catoctin Mountain Artist-In-Residence (AIR) program, under the auspices of the Catoctin Forest Alliance, Inc., offers visual, literary, and performing artists an opportunity to work in a natural and historic setting to advance art, nature, and history education and appreciation. To learn more about the Catoctin Mountain Artist-in-Residence (AIR) program or to apply, visit the Catoctin Forest Alliance website.                   Catoctin Mountain Artists-in-Residence Gallery   26 Photos  Catoctin Mountain Artists-in-Residence Gallery",
