    "body": "Explore This Park    Get Involved     Support Your Park             Support Your Park        Every year Cumberland Island relies on the generosity of visitors and volunteers alike-- each supports our operations in their own way. Hundreds of volunteers donate thousands of hours in service to the Seashore supporting our interpretive programs, providing trail maintenance and staffing our museum. Every visitor who makes a purchase through our cooperating association, Eastern National directly supports Interpretation and Education programs here at Cumberland Island. A percentage of sales remains in the Park to support these programs. Visitors also support our Park by following the universally accepted Leave No Trace Principles which include... 1.) Plan Ahead and Prepare 2.) Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces 3.) Dispose of Waste Properly 4.) Leave What You Find 5.) Minimize Campfire Impacts 6.) Respect Wildlife 7.) Be Considerate of Other Visitors",
