Although few written records about the activities of the North West Company and their trade at Grand Portage survive, one important document that has survived to greatly benefit research on the site is an inventory of goods present at the depot in June 1797.

The following are just some examples:   150+ axes 3,000+ awls 250+ files 20 firesteels 14 hammers 24 garden hoes 204 scissors 1,300 thimbles     The following examples in the gallery were collected during archeological excavations at Grand Portage and the Quetico-Superior Underwater Archeology Project.
