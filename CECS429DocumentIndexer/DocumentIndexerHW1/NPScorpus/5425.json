Pets are allowed on a leash on the trails in the lower canyon: Silver Spur Trail, Faraway Ranch, Bonita Creek, and the trail connecting the visitor center and the campground. A good rule of thumb is that a pet may go anywhere a car may go: roads and road shoulders, picnic area turnouts, campground, and parking lots. Where are pets not allowed? Pets are not permitted on hiking trails in the park (exceptions are listed above), or inside visitor centers or other park facilities. Are there regulations regarding pets in the park*?  Pets must be on a leash at all times. Pets should not be left unattended in vehicles. Hazardous conditions exist, such as hot weather, which can endanger an animal. Please clean up after your pet and take responsibility for its behavior.  *The regulations do not apply to Seeing Eye dogs accompanying visually impaired persons or other guide animals for disabled individuals. Why are activities with pets in the park limited? As a national park unit, Chiricahua National Monument protects the wildlife and habitat within its boundaries. Pets can create conditions that may disturb these protected resources.  The territorial scents dogs leave behind disrupt the behavior of native animals that this park has been set aside to protect. Dogs are predators that could chase, scare, kill, and transmit diseases to wild animals. Wild animals can transmit diseases to pets (and then to humans).  Are there areas outside of the park where I may take my pet? Coronado National Forest surrounds Chiricahua National Monument. The National Forest areas allow pets with limited regulations.",
