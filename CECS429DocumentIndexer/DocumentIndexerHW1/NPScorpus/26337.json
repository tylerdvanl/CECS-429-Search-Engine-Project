    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility             Accessibility       Service Animals The cave includes steep, open-grate stairways, spiral staircases, and irregular low ceilings.  Service animals have not been able to safely perform assistance functions in the cave due to their unwillingness or inability to negotiate in this environment.  For these reasons, no animals, including service animals, are permitted on a regular guided tour.  Special arrangements can be made with the National Park Service to provide cave access for visitors covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act. Contact the Monument as soon as you know of your visit so that arrangements can be made. All arrangements are subject to visitor safety and resource protection considerations. Canes The use of a cane, staff, or other walking assistance device on a cave tour must meet all safety considerations and be approved by the Superintendent or designee. Canes or walking devices must have stem diameters greater than one inch or they will present a safety hazard. Wheelchairs Only the first room of the cave is accessible for wheelchairs. The Visitor Center at the Monument and the historic Chateau lodge are wheelchair accessible via a mobile ramp. Both buildings are the original structures constructed in the 1920s and 1930s. Oregon Caves is in the process of completing a study on providing better access to the buildings and has requested funding for the necessary rehabilitation and repair projects. Trails We are currently working on developing wheelchair accessible trails.",
