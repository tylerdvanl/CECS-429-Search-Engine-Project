Â    Everglades Fire Management Partners With Missoula Fire Lab to Improve Fuel Models Everglades Fire Management in partnership with Missoula Fire Lab, United States Forest Service, is working to understand how fire acts on the landscape in Everglades National Park.  Revised three-dimensional fire behavior models now incorporating environmental factors such as water depth, water quality, and fuel availability will aid fire managers in planning for future wildfire response and prescribed fire treatments in Everglades National Park.   In late 2014, crews from Missoula Fire Lab and Everglades Fire Management worked to establish pre-burn study plots.  Sawgrass and marl prairie communities were clipped, dried, and weighed to quantify the fuel loading (biomass of vegetation) in study plots.  The team will use data collected before, during, and after prescribed fires to improve our understanding of fire in the dynamic Everglades ecosystem.
