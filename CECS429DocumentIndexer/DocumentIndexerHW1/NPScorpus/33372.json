    "body": "Native Grasses        Roemer's fescue (above) and other native grasses were cultivated in 2010 in a demonstration garden located in front of the American Camp visitor center. Mike Vouri   Â    Native grasses   One of the park's major projects at San Juan Island NHP is to restore the grasslands to native vegetation at American Camp. This is critical to restore the health of the ecosystem as well as support native wildlife. Native Grasses are critical for many species. For example, the streaked horned lark, which was once a common breeder on the Cattle Point Peninsula, is no longer found here because it nests at the base of bunchgrass, which has been crowded out by non-native plant species.   Some of the native grasses that are being planted as part of the program are Sitka brome (Bromus sitchensis var. sitchensis), Jepson's blue wildrye (Elymus glaucus ssp. Jepsonii), and Roemer's fescue (Festuca roemeri).",
