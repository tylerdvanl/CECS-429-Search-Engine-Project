The success of this program is measured not only in the number of campers, but in the quality of their experience. Each year we encourage participants and group leaders to share how their experience at Lassen has impacted them. We use this feedback to measure our level of success in meeting program goals and to expand and improve the program for the next year. Here is what campers and group leaders have shared: This place will give me a lot of memories and when I have kids I would bring them here - I would want them to see this.  Nothing can prepare you for a first experience in a wonderland of geothermal features. The kids could not believe their eyes or their noses.  This trip was important to my life because I became a better leader. It was also important because I learned to like the outdoors more.  I had never seen a volcano in my life, so it was very special for me to see that.  I believe this trip blew their worlds wide open…New interests were discovered and a profound respect for the environment was gained.  We climbed Mt. Lassen today and boy, it was rough, but I made it and it was fun.  One of the most profound activities occurred when all of the kids sat around the campfire and spoke of their dreams of college…a campfire is a wonderful place to dream.",
