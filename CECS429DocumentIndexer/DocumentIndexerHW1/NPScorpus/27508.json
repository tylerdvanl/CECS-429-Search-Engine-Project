    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Permits & Reservations     Picnic Area                Picnic Area         Eight picnic tables are available near the park entrance NPS  The park has nine picnic tables available for use on a \"first come, first serve\" basis. Eight picnic tables are in a designated area between the Visitor Center and the Stockade Fort; two are ADA accessible. These tables do not have any shelter structure above them but are situated in the shade. Receptacles for trash and recycled materials are nearby. The ninth picnic table is at the Star Fort Pond and is placed under a small shelter. Parties of more than 15 people must obtain a special use permit. Use the special use permit application to reserve for organized picnics of 15+ individuals. Unfortunately, we cannot hold dates. The picnic area is available from dawn to dusk. Please read and sign the application and return with the requisite fees. This can only be done in person between 10 am and 4:00 pm at our physical address below or via U.S. Postal Service. When we receive the complete application and fees, you will be notified if it has been approved and asked to sign a binding permit at that time.   After the application has been reviewed and a permit granted a non-refundable check for the fee of $35 (for reservation of the picnic area) is required for groups of 15- 50 people. The fee is $60 for groups of 50-75 people. The area cannot accommodate more than 75 people. Payment must be made in the form of a check to the National Park Service. The area is not reserved for your group until the payment is received in our office. The fee is waived for curriculum-based school groups and the military. This permit is for the picnic area only, not all surrounding grounds or area. Parking is allowed only in marked spaces. It is expected that the area, including restrooms, will be left clean and orderly at the conclusion of your use. Adherence to all the rules and regulations governing the battlefield in addition to permit conditions will insure the continued privilege of using the picnic area.   Please call the Permit Coordinator at 864-543-4068 for more information.",
