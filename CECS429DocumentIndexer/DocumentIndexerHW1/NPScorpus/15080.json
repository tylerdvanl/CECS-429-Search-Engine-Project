This outstanding outdoor education program has been teaching winter ecology, snowshoe basics, and winter survival to school groups for over 20 years. Each program is tailored to meet the learning objectives of each class\/grade, and meet the appropriate curriculum standards. Programs are offered Wednesday - Friday, January 22 - April 5, 2014 at the Kohm Yah-mah-nee Visitor Center near the Southwest entrance of the park. Programs are generally 2-3 hours in length, however longer programs are available. Depending of snow conditions a Winter Survival and Snow Shelter program will also be offered in February and March. The park supplies snowshoes for students and adults for use during the snowshoe walk program. There is no cost for the program and entrance fees will be waived. However, we do request a $1.00 donation per participant for maintenance and replacement of our snowshoes. All programs are by reservation only.
