Please note the following cautions. • Please be alert when crossing the street from the parking area. Saint-Gaudens Road is a through street and frequented by local residents. •   Because of the historic nature of the site, pathways and grounds may be uneven. The brick walkways and marble steps may also be slippery when wet. • Poison ivy is found in several areas of the park, especially along the forest edge and in parts of the lower field. Signs mark many of the locations, though not all. The ranger at the entrance station can show you how to identify the plant. • While not common, bees such as yellow jackets are sometimes found in the park. Those with bee sting allergies should be prepared with the appropriate medications. • If you have an accident in the park, or injure yourself, please contact a ranger immediately. The park has well equipped first aid kits and can assist you. The local rescue squad and ambulance service will also respond quickly to any major medical emergencies.  During the off season months,November-April, most areas of the park are not maintained for public use. Visitors should take care as many pathways and trails may be snow covered and slippery. Trails are also not regularly patrolled during the off season.",
