A skink is a type of lizard that can tolerate a temperate climate and enjoys living in building foundations, under logs, and in rock walls. They are extremely fast and you must be quick to see them out in the open. The young skinks have bright blue tails that will detach to help them escape from predators. They have very smooth skin and are sleek in appearance.        Sean McCann  Eastern Fence Lizard These lizards can be even harder to spot than skinks!  They have amazing camouflage and lightning quick speed. Fence lizards are most often seen on trees or possibly scurrying under a bush.  They have a more typical 'lizard' appearance, with rough scaly skin.",
