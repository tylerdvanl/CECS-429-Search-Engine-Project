They are actually alliances between two very different organisms: fungi and algae. Lichens can be found throughout Whiskeytown growing on boulders, trees, and decomposed granite soils. While a complete inventory of lichens in the park has never been conducted, a preliminary survey was undertaken in 2003 by the California Lichen Society. This two day survey documented 22 lichen species in the park and was a great first step to gaining a more complete understanding of these little known organisms.",
