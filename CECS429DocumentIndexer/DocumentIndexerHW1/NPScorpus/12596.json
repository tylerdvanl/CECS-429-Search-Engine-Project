But more importantly, it is something we simply cannot live without. NPS Photo   Â    Educational outreach is a large component of the air program of these Parks. Informational talks are given as training to park employees who in turn provide information to visitors to these Parks. Air pollution issues are presented to school groups, various organizations, and the media. Education focuses on different types of air pollution present in the Parks, the sources of Park air pollutants, air pollution monitoring efforts by Park staff, possible effects of air pollutants on living things within the Parks, and actions that people can take to help prevent and reduce air pollution.
