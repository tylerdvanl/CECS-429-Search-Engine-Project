We also know that in places like Big Bend National Park, fire is a normal part of a healthy natural environment. Based on that understanding, the National Park Service, like most land management agencies, has radically changed its policy on fire management and fire suppression. Restoring Fire in Big Bend We will always have fires in Big Bend. We have learned that our original policy of total fire suppression not only made drastic changes in the local ecosystem, it also led to a hazardous buildup of dead wood and brush.  The new policies and attitudes towards fire management will restore and reinvigorate Big Bend's plant and animal communities to more natural conditions. Proper fire management will also enable us to more easily contain future fires that threaten human life, property, and precious resources.",
