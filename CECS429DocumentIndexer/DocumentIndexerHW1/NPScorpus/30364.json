Lawson Waterman purchased the property between 1844 and 1878. Also known as the Bishop Farm, Heritage Farms illustrates many of the trends associated with Cuyahoga Valley farming, including a long history of self-sufficiency, diverse products, and appeal to local markets.       Lawson Waterman in front of his farmhouse. NPS Collection       The Landscape At one time, the farm included three homes and 19 other buildings. Today, only two original structures remain standing: the barn-in continual use since its construction in 1846-and the farmhouse on top of the hill. Each generation made changes to the property to meet the needs of their growing business. They added and removed buildings, timbered woods, and cleared pasture lands.          In Their Own Words Click the topic to hear a story about Cuyahoga Valley life. Click here to read the text file.

Lawson Waterman and his wife Angeline operated a general farm with a large flock of sheep, a dairy, and fields of potatoes. Lawson also owned a boat yard on the Ohio & Erie Canal. Later, nephew Charles E. Bishop inherited the farm. With his wife Kate, Charles expanded the dairy to 50 milking cows. Robert Poole Bishop (Charles' grandson) and his wife Jeanette took over the farm in 1948. They replaced the dairy herd with Aberdeen Angus beef cattle and planted Christmas trees. A fifth-generation Bishop farmer, Carol Haramis and her husband Kim currently own and operate the farm. Heritage Farms sells Christmas trees, pumpkins, daylilies, and maple syrup; hosts seasonal events, including Peninsula Farmers' Market and Pumpkin Pandemonium; and rents space for meetings and events.       Lawson Waterman's descendant Carol Haramis and her husband now operate Heritage Farms on the property where they sell daylilies and other products. ©Jeffrey Gibson       Click on the links to discover more:    Former Coliseum Property Conrad Botzum Farmstead Point Farm Welton Farm Heritage Farm",
