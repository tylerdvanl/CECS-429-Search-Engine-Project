    "body": "Be A Junior Ranger          The Junior Ranger program at Tuzigoot National Monument is a group of fun activities which focus on archeology and preservation in understanding our past and our present. The program is available at the Tuzigoot Visitor Center, or you can download it here and turn it in to a ranger when you visit.  Completing the book takes some work, but the rewards are tremendous. Junior Rangers earn a shiny badge and certificate! Special Note: There is no age limit to become a Junior Ranger. That means everyone is eligible to become an official Junior Ranger as long as they do the work and earn it!",
