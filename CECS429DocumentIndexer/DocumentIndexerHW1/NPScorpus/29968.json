Occasional layers of heavy mineral sands-which include grains of garnet and magnetite-appear as colored bands among the predominantly white sediment. There are also small amounts of feldspar, tourmaline, mica, and other minerals. Occasionally, you will find pebbles or fragments of shell on the beach.       Dynamic Beaches  The size and shape of the beach is always changing. While sediment is constantly being moved more or less perpendicular to or from the shoreline by tidal and wave action, the predominant net movement of sediment is along Fire Island's coast, parallel to the shore through the effects of longshore currents. The movement of sediment along the shoreline is called longshore sediment transport.       Learn More  Fire Island Shoreline Dynamics Long Island's Dynamic South Shore Coastal Geology in our National Parks Ocean and Coastal Resources Coastal Processes Coastal Geology",
