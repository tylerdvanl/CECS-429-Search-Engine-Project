    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Operating Hours & Seasons              Operating Hours & Seasons       Crater Lake National Park is open year-round, 24 hours a day. Some roads, trails, and facilities, however, are closed seasonally due to snow. Much of the year, the park's North Entrance Road and Rim Drive are closed to cars. They close for the season on November 1 (or earlier if there is significant snowfall). Crews begin plowing these roads in April, but opening dates vary. The North Entrance and West Rim Drive tend to open in late May or early June. The East Rim Drive typically opens in early July. Highway 62 is open year-round. The road to Rim Village is also open year-round, except during periods of heavy snow. Visit the Current Conditions page to find out what's open in the park today.",
