As the Arkansas River was not always navigable, it was difficult for them to receive supplies.  When they weren't drilling they farmed and tended livestock in order to ensure an adequate food supply for the fort.  The soldiers had been sent to help establish peace between the Osage and Cherokee Indians. They were able to do so without engaging in any direct military confrontation. The closest they came to open hostilities was in April of 1821 when the Osage came to the fort demanding gunpowder to fight the Cherokees. The incident became known as the Bad Tempered Buffalo Affair.",
