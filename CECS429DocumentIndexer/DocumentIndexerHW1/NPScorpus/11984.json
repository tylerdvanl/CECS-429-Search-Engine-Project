Do not attempt to pass equestrians until you have alerted the riders and asked them for permission. • Park off the trail, even in remote areas, to keep trail clear for other users or emergency vehicles. Resource Protection • Do not cut switchbacks or create new trails. • Do not disturb wildlife. • Leave gates as you found them (open or closed) or as signed. • Avoid muddy trails, avoid skidding, and reduce your speed in corners during turns. • Pack out what you pack in.",
