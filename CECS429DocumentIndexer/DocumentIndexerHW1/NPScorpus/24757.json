The Senate passed a new Park Concessions Bill, S. 1693, Public Law: 105-391 (11\/13\/98), also known as the \"Thomas Bill\", improving the management of national parks. This bill is the first major change in more than three decades in the way concessions contracts are awarded and ensures that all important future contracts will be awarded through competitive bidding, which will provide better service to the visiting public and a better return to the taxpayers. New concession regulations needed as a result of this bill are in the works.
