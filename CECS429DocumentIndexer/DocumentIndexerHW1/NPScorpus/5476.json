    "body": "Bald Eagle          Haliaeetus leucocephalus According to the Breeding Bird Survey, Maryland has increased its bald eagle population since 1989. Habitats for these  birds can be found in National Park Service sites in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, including Oxon Cove Park. Oxon Cove Park provides an excellent breeding habitat for the bald eagle. The Potomac River provides a food source of fish, waterfowl, and seabirds.  Tall coniferous, deciduous trees, or cliffs near water provide a perfect nesting  and roosting area for these birds. Protection of existing nest sites and maintaining suitable habitat throughout tidal waterways are critical to the continued existence of the Bald Eagle.",
