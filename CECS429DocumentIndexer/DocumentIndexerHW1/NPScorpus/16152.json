On Monday, July 4, at 11 a.m., Dr. Jeremy Tewell will present \"A Self-evident Lie,\" a program examining the extent to which Civil War-era Northerners and Southerners agreed with the proposition that \"all men are created equal.\" While some pro-slavery supporters denounced the Declaration of Independence as a \"self-evident lie,\" some Northerners, most notably Abraham Lincoln, held that the only effective safeguard to individual liberty was universal liberty. Lincoln and others argued that as long as Americans believed that all men, at least in principle, were endowed with such inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, everyone's liberty would be self-evident, regardless of social standing or circumstance.
