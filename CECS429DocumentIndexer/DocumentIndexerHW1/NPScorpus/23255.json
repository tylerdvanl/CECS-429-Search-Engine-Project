NPS L. Cartmell  Have you ever wanted to be a park ranger? Now is your chance! By participating in Capulin Volcano National Monument's Junior Ranger and Ladybug Hunt programs, you can help real park rangers by learning what makes Capulin Volcano so special and how you can help protect it for future Junior Rangers.   Junior Rangers (Ages 6 and up)  What kind of volcano is Capulin? What animals make their homes here? You will find out the answers to these questions and many more while completing the Junior Ranger activity book.  Children ages 6 and older are invited to pick up a Junior Ranger activity book at the visitor center upon arrival to the monument. Don't forget to watch the park film and ask a ranger which programs are being offered while you are there. After completing the activities, bring your book to a park ranger and show them what you have learned. If you think you are ready, the ranger will swear you in with the Junior Ranger Pledge and present you with your very own Junior Ranger badge to take home!  Can't wait to get started? You can download a copy of the Junior Ranger book here and get a head start on finishing the activities before you arrive.   Junior Junior Rangers (Ages 5 and under)  1, 2, 3? How many ladybugs do you see? Children ages 5 and under are invited to participate in the Capulin Volcano Junior Junior Ranger program, an educational activity book. If you come at the right time of year, you might even get to see the famous Capulin Volcano ladybugs! All participants are rewarded with a certificate and ladybug badge upon completion. Can't wait to get started? You can download a copy of the Junior Junior Ranger book here and get a head start on finishing the activities before you arrive.  Let's Move Outside!  In addition to the Junior Ranger and Ladybug Hunt programs, all children are encouraged to take part in the national Let's Move Outside! program. By simply hiking the 1-mile rim trail at the top of the volcano, you can earn a special patch in addition to your Junior Ranger or Ladybug Hunt badge.",
