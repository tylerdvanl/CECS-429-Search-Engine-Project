Some are large urban park areas, such as Folger, Lincoln, Marion and Stanton parks. Others are squares and triangles created by Pierre L'Enfant's 1791 plan for Washington, DC (and subsequent modifications to that plan). Seward Square, Twining Square, the Potomac Avenue Metro Station, and the median and center parking areas along Pennsylvania Avenue are also some of the areas.",
