    "body": "Mountain Biking       Riding the backcountry and primitive roads of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area is a great way to enjoy the scenery of the Colorado Plateau. As more and more people turn to biking as a means to reach these scenic areas, it’s important to keep in mind some safe and ethical riding practices.      Respect the Land Bicycles are vehicles and can do much damage to fragile desert soils and vegetation. Help us protect this special place by not riding cross-country, across slickrock, or on foot trails or closed roads. STAY ON DESIGNATED ROADS AT ALL TIMES. There are NO AREAS where you may ride a bike along or from the shoreline of Lake Powell. Overnight camping along roads within Glen Canyon National Recreation Area is permitted. You may also HIKE away from roads to camp without your bike. Carry a lock to secure your bike on the road. Riding or pushing your bike off road is not allowed. Remember always to carry all of your trash back out with you. PACK IT IN; PACK IT OUT!      Be Prepared Carry plenty of water - a MINIMUM of 1 gallon (4 liters) per person per day. You should also have a repair kit, extra tire tube and pump, and a first aid kit. Be prepared for temperature extremes and sudden storms. Carry raingear and polypropylene or wool outerwear for strong winds. In summer, ride early or late in the day to avoid intense midday heat. ALWAYS wear a helmet and gloves for safety. Terrain here can be extremely rugged. Watch out for other cyclists and vehicles. Use extreme caution on steep descents. Frequent snacking on easily digested, high-energy foods is much better than eating two or three large meals a day. Some good choices might be bananas and citrus to replace electrolytes, breads, granola bars, fruit and nut mixtures, and similar items.
