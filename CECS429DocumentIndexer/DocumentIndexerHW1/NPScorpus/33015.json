Exhibits, an orientation film and friendly staff will help you make the most of your time at Olympic.  After your visitor center stop, you might consider one of these options:   A 45-minute drive from Port Angeles to Hurricane Ridge brings you from the lowlands blanketed with old growth forests to treeline, where clumps of subalpine firs give way to open meadows.  On a clear day, views of the Olympic Mountains and Strait of Juan de Fuca are spectacular. From Port Angeles, drive about 30 minutes west to Lake Crescent where you can stroll along the shores of the 12-mile long, glacially-carved lake. From Forks, a 20-minute drive will bring you to Rialto Beach, where you can walk along a beach amidst drift logs and stones, watch waves crash onto offshore islands, and perhaps spot a bald eagle soaring overhead.      One Day  With one long day, you'll have time for a quick visit to each of Olympic's major ecosystems, the mountains, the forest and the coast.    You can reach nearly a mile in elevation with a trip to Hurricane Ridge, where you'll find a visitor center and nature trails.  Beginning early in the morning will increase your chances of seeing wildlife and help avoid the larger number of visitors later in the day.   From Hurricane Ridge, a three-hour drive to the west will bring you to the Hoh Rain Forest.  A visitor center, picnic area and short nature trails can enhance your rain forest visit. After leaving the Hoh, an hour and a half drive toward the northwest will bring you to Rialto Beach on the Pacific Ocean in time for sunset.  Grocery stores, restaurants and other amenities are available in the towns of Port Angeles, Forks and at other locations along Highway 101 and the park access roads.      Two or More Days  With more time, you can explore more of Olympic's diversity.  Perhaps you'd like to spend a few hours or longer hiking one of the park's trails, or visiting a lesser-known area like Deer Park or the Quinault Valley.  You'll find more ideas in the Places to Go section of this site.",
