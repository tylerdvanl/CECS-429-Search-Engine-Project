    "body": "Rules of the Trail                 The International Mountain Biking Association (IMBA) developed the following Rules of the Trail to help promote responsible and courteous riding on shared-use trails.  Ride Open Trails: Respect road and trail closures- ask for clarification if you are uncertain about the status of a trail. (Maps and information about all mountain bike trails in the park are available here) Leave No Trace: Be sensitive to the dirt beneath you. Wet and muddy trails are more vulnerable to damage than dry ones. Don't cut switchbacks. Be sure to pack out at least as much as you pack in. Control Your Bicycle: Inattention for even a moment could put you and others at risk. Obey all bicycle speed regulations and recommendations, and ride within your limits. Yield Appropriately: Do your utmost to let your fellow trail users know you're coming- a friendly greeting or bell ring are good methods. Try to anticipate other trail users as you ride around corners. Bicyclists traveling downhill should yield to ones headed uphill. Bicyclists should always yield to pedestrian traffic. In general, strive to make each pass a safe and courteous one. Never Scare Animals: Animals are easily startled by an unannounced approach, a sudden movement, or a loud noise. Give animals enough room and time to adjust to you. Plan Ahead: Know your equipment, your ability, and the area in which you are riding and prepare accordingly. Strive to be self-sufficient: keep your equipment in good repair and carry necessary supplies for changes in weather or other conditions. Always wear a helmet and appropriate safety gear.",
