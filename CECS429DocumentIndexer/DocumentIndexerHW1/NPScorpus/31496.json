They are open to park visitors during park hours, except for special services, such as weddings and funerals.        The dam (top), acequia irrigation ditch and aqueduct (bottom) make up part of Mission Espada's 270-year old irrigation system.   Things To See and Do, Briefly  When visiting San Antonio Missions National Historical Park, plan to spend at least a couple of hours - four hours if you have the time. Free guided tours, movies, and demonstrations are scheduled throughout the week.  Besides the four historic missions and their churches, check out the grist mill at Mission San José, and the 270-year old Espada acequia (irrigation system) with its dam and aqueduct. The San Juan Demonstration Farm has recently come on-line, with programming periodically scheduled during the year.  The Spanish missions were established on the frontier and there are still portions of native habitat excellent for birding. A section of the original river can be viewed from the nature trail at Mission San Juan.  Finally, the San Antonio River Authority has completed Mission Riverwalk, which extends from just south of downtown San Antonio to beyond Mission Espada. The 10+ mile trail is perfect for both walkers and bikers interested in a natural view of the river. Portals indicate Mission Riverwalk exits to each mission.       The park has over 180 species of birds, including the hummingbird and ibis.",
