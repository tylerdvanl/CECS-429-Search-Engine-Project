Also known as Salt cedar, this aggressive shrub has impacted all the major river systems in the western United States. The Chihuahan Desert \/Southern Shortgrass Prairie Exotic Plant Management Team has provided significant support for this project. As of June, 2004, all 350+ acres that originally infested the park had been eradicated.   Other weeds of concern on site are Russian knapweed, Canada thistle, Whitetop, Kochia, and Bindweed, but are controlled using Integrated Pest Management principles.",
