NPS\/Johnson       Civil War Washington Teacher Fellows Program Explore the Civil War through the lens of the Nation's Capital. During this summer program, teacher fellows spend a week at Ford's Theatre, Tudor Place, President Lincoln's Cottage, and the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site. At each site, teacher fellows focus on both the content and different techniques (oratory, performance, primary sources, etc.) for incorporating that knowledge into the classroom. It is an amazing week with some of the best teachers from around the country. You will leave this program familiar with an array of virtual tours and the oratory skills necessary to get your students on their feet performing speeches by Lincoln and Douglass. You will feel comfortable taking students on content-driven experiential learning adventures and excited about using classroom drama to help historic characters come alive!  The dates for summer 2016 will be announced soon. Visit Ford's Theatre's website to apply and to find more information.",
