    "body": "Wildflowers        A cluster of camas blossom on the redoubt at American Camp. Islanders and visitors are on the alert for this plant, which is of cultural significance. Mike Vouri   Â    One of the most enchanting times to visit San Juan Island NHP is in spring, when native wildflowers bloom. Purple camas and sprays of spring gold blanket American Camp's open prairie, along with hooked spur violets, small flower woodland-stars, and buttercups. Along the bluffs, look for tiny blue-eyed Marys, seashore lupines and chocolate lilies. The area on the Redoubt looks like a wedding bouquet, with red sorrel, purple camas and white Death camas. On the ridge of Mt. Finlayson, you'll find Miner's lettuce, desert parsley (around the parking lot), sheep sorrel, prairie saxifrage, and two varieties of brodiaea. At English Camp, follow a trail of fawn lilies on your way up to Mt. Young, and look off the trail for smatterings of purple shooting stars. Efforts are underway to restore native wildflowers through eradicating invasive, non-native plants. Pick up a free wildflower guide at the American Camp visitor center.
