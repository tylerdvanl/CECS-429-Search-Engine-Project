    "body": "Field Trip Safety and Equipment       Trip planning and preparation are key to a safe and fun educational experience. Be advised that the weather can change quickly and dramatically so program participants should be prepared for a variety of weather conditions at any time of year. Please note that although the weather at your school or home may be fall- or spring-like, it may be winter conditions at the park.  Please have your students dress in layers with warm waterproof clothing, and plan accordingly for everyone's comfort and safety. WEATHER Check the parkâ€™s weather forecast before leaving school. WINTER DRIVING Washington State Law requires all vehicles (even all- or four-wheel drive) to carry the correct tire chains during winter travel. Be sure that your bus driver is carrying chains. A WILD & DYNAMIC LANDSCAPE Mount Rainier is an active volcano and a dynamic natural landscape. A visit to the park may involve exposure to volcanic and other natural hazards such as debris flows, floods, eruptive events, earthquakes, wildlife encounters, slips, trips, falls, exposure to extreme weather conditions, and others. The best thing you can do is be prepared and ensure that your students are prepared and follow all park regulations and staff instructions. We look forward to working with you and your students and providing a safe and fun educational experience.",
