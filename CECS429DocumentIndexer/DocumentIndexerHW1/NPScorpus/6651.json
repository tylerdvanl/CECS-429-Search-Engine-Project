    "body": "Hunting & Fishing         Turkeys are popular game birds on private land along the Niobrara NSR. NPS Photo    Game birds, waterfowl, white-tailed deer, and various other wildlife provide excellent hunting opportunities along the Niobrara National Scenic River. There is limited public land for hunting along the Niobrara; most hunting occurs on private property. Individuals who wish to hunt on private property must be granted access by the landowner. All state hunting regulations apply on public and private property.  Angling opportunities are abundant along the Niobrara National Scenic River and its many tributaries. Rainbow and brown trout are present in several spring-branch canyon tributaries, and can provide a challenge for any avid fly fisher. Anglers interested in using the more popular bait or lure methods can try their hand at channel catfish, carp, bluegill, green sunfish, grass pickerel, and many other fish species. A valid Nebraska fishing license is required, and all state rules and regulations apply on the Niobrara.",
