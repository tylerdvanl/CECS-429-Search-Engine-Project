This is the largest oil spill in the San Francisco Bay since the Cape Mohican incident in 1996. An Incident Command Team was established and appropriate measures were put in place. By Friday, November 9, park staff and visitors began to find oil and oiled birds at Point Reyes National Seashore. Beaches, esteros, and other areas will be closed to the public if oil is discovered at those locations. Check below for the most recent list of closures. Please observe and obey posted signs. ATTENTION: Please do not approach or pick up bunker fuel or an oiled animal! Bunker fuel is an extremely toxic substance and is dangerous to all animals, including humans. ONLY hazardous materials-trained and equipped personnel should handle bunker fuel or oiled wildlife. If you locate an oiled bird or a glob of oil within Point Reyes National Seashore, please immediately report it to the Point Reyes National Seashore Dispatch office at 415-464-5170.

Park biologists, park rangers, and volunteers are monitoring Limantour, Palomarin, RCA, Agate, Wildcat, and Great Beaches for oil and oiled birds. Some very small globules of oil have been found on Drakes Beach. Limantour was found to be clean of oil this morning. RCA and Agate Beach have a \"fairly significant number\" of globules of oil. RCA and Palomarin Beaches were temporarily closed today. The Limantour Estero Boom (1500 feet+) was installed yesterday, but failed last night.

Approximately 2,500 feet of boom is on site at Drakes Estero. Winds are from the northwest today. Thus, movement of oil is predicted to head south away from Point Reyes. A contract crew is on site at Bolinas Lagoon to install additional boom structures.
