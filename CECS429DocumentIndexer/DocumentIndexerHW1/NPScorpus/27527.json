    "body": "Riding With Forrest         General Nathan Bedford Forrest   As a prisoner, William Holland was assigned to Dr. James Cowan, General Forrest’s chief surgeon, as a “waitman” or servant. Holland remained with Forrest’s soldiers for three months, until after the Confederates were defeated at Franklin and Nashville. In early 1865, he somehow made it back to Union lines. Unfortunately, Holland did not leave any more details about his time riding with Forrest’s raiders. We can only assume that he spent most of his time tending to the sick, dying and wounded and maybe to Dr. Cowan’s personal needs. How Holland got away and rejoined his unit also remains a mystery.      NEXT PAGE",
