Major annual events along the Anza Trail include:          October In October 1775, the Anza Expedition departed the Tubac Presidio to become the first overland colonizing expedition to Alta California. Volunteers and organizations mark this anniversary with re-enactment rides, heritage events, and festivals at historic sites in Santa Cruz and Pima Counties such as the Tubac Presidio State Historic Park and Museum, Tumacácori National Historic Park, and the Historic Hacienda de la Canoa.         June The families of the Anza Expedition arrived at their destination to establish the Presidio of San Francisco on June 27, 1776. Every June, descendants of these families gather in San Francisco to honor their ancestors, and the Anza Trail and partner organizations sponsor heritage events to explore the history of Early California.",
