Â    People for a Golden Gate National Recreation Area (PFGGNRA) Papers GOGA 35304 (1.1MB pdf) This collection is shaped around the work of the ad-hoc committee People for a Golden Gate National Recreation Area (PFGGNRA) from 1970 to 1994. The organization's original goal was to establish the GGNRA, and it continued to oversee the expansion of the park and the implementation of the enabling legislation.  These papers were amassed by Amy Meyer, founding member and co-chairman of the committee.   Presidio of San Francisco Historical Real Estate Files GOGA 35159 (pdf 492K) Historical real estate documents, maps, and plans for the military lands comprised of the Presidio of San Francisco and surrounding environs such as Fort Baker and Fort Mason. The files contain permits and licenses granted by the Army to individuals and companies for the use of military buildings and lands as well as agreements between the Army and various parties negotiating boundaries, water usage, rights of way, and utilities. A significant portion of the permits and agreements are with the Panama-Pacific International Exposition Company for use of Presidio lands during the Panama-Pacific International Exposition and with the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District giving them permission to run a state road through the Presidio and Fort Baker. There are also the titles and deeds for the acquisition of Lobos Creek and the Wherry Housing apartment complex.",
