We will be hiking every 2nd and 4th Saturday from January through April - for 8 total day hikes until they complete all 69 miles of the trail! We'll be exploring the park along the Backbone Trail, or BBT as it is affectionately called, a network of trails made up of federal, state, and other local parklands. Visit the Backbone Trail Homepage and learn about the history of the BBT and how through partnerships we can connect our parks together along the crest of the mountains.
