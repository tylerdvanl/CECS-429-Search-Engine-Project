This unique site stands on Pennsylvania Avenue near the halfway point between the White House and the Capitol. The Old Post Office Tower ranks third in height among the buildings of the Nation's Capital, soaring to a majestic 315 feet. At the 270 foot level, there is an observation deck allowing visitors an awe-inspiring view of Washington D.C. and the surrounding area. Beneath the observation deck is the tower clock, now more than a century old. On the tenth floor are the beautiful Bells of Congress. These bells are replicas of those at London’s Westminster Abbey and were a Bicentennial gift from the Ditchley Foundation in England.
