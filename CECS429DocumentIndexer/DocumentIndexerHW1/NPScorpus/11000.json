The same legislation also extends the authorization of the John H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor for six years, through the end of Fiscal Year 2021, and adds the Town of Auburn, Massachusetts, and additional portions of Providence, Rhode Island to the Heritage Corridor.   The Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park was established to help preserve, protect, and interpret the nationally significant resources that exemplify the industrial heritage of the Blackstone River Valley. The park will also support the preservation, protection, and interpretation of the urban, rural, and agricultural landscape features (including the Blackstone River and Canal) of the region that provide an overarching context for the industrial heritage of the Blackstone River Valley.  In addition, the park will interpret the nationally significant sites and districts that convey the industrial history of the Blackstone River Valley, and work to support the network of partners, related resources, and facilities throughout the John H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor.         Blackstone Canal and the Kelly House in Blackstone River State Park    While the final boundaries of the Park have not yet been established, the Park will include:    The Blackstone River State Park in Lincoln, RI  Old Slater Mill National Historic Landmark District in Pawtucket, RI   Slatersville Historic District in North Smithfield, RI   Ashton Historic District in Cumberland, RI   Whitinsville Historic District in Northbridge, MA   Hopedale Village Historic District, in Hopedale, MA   The Blackstone River and tributaries of Blackstone River   The Blackstone Canal          The Little Red Shop and the Draper Corporation Loom Shop in Hopedale.   This legislation is just the beginning of the Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park. There is much work to do before the vision of the legislation comes to life. Now National Park Service professionals in park planning, land acquisition, interpretation, and administration –with input from communities and partners –will begin to take the steps necessary to get a new park in operation.   The general management plan for the Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park will be completed within three years of the date on which funds are made available. The National Park Service looks forward to working with all of you over the next few years on the planning and development of YOUR new National Park.        Click here to see the legislation that created the Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park   Click here to see the legislation that extended the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor",
