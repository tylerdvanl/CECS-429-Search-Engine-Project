    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility             Accessibility      Restroom FacilitiesWe have three types of restroom facilities at Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area:Wood-sided pit toilets: These are the oldest facilities in the park. There is no running water but are open all year long. They are technically ADA accessible. We are in the process of replacing all of these with new CXT (see below) vault toilets. CXT cement vault toilets: These facilities also do not have running water but are open all year long. They are ADA accessible.  Comfort stations: These are the facilities with flush toilets and running water located in our campgrounds and day use areas. They are only open during the summer season. They are ADA accessible. CampingWe have a limited number of ADA accessible campsites at our larger campgrounds. These can be reserved through Recreation.gov. Reservations are strongly recommended between Memorial Day Weekend and Labor Day Weekend. The rest of the year they are available on a first come, first served basis. None of our campsites have hook-ups. There are several full service RV parks scattered throughout Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area.BoatingDue to varying lake levels some of our boat launches and docks are more accessible than others. Please feel free to send us an email or give us a call  at 509-754-7800 before you come to find out which ones we recommend.
