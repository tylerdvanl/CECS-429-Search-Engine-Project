A group of bats cling to the roof of a cave.   The importance of bats to ecosystems around the world is well established. Many species consume insects that would otherwise affect human health or damage crops and forests. Without bats to control insect populations, farmers would be forced to use more pesticides. This, in turn, would result in an increase in the price of certain foods. It is estimated that by eating insects, bats save the agricultural industry over $23 billion each year. Other bat species are valuable in the pollination of plants and the dispersal of plant seeds.",
