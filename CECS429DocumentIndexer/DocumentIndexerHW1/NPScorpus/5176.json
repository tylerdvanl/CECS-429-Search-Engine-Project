Grills are not provided anywhere in the park, but you are welcome to bring your own, except to Kittatinny Point. Ground fires are prohibited throughout the park. Do not bring wood from outside the park for any purpose;it may contain invasive insects and other organisms that threaten the survival of local plant and animal life.
