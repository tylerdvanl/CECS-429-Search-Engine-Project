It is surrounded by forest but offers partial views to the south of Tolmie Park. The trail begins at Carbon River entrance on the Carbon River Road trail. 3.6 miles up the trail, the Green Lakes trail leaves the road at Ranger Creek. The trail leads through a forest of massive old-growth trees on its moderate ascent to the lake. One mile up the trail is Ranger Falls. Beyond the falls the trail ascends another .8 mile to Green Lake. NOTE: Always check current trail conditions before heading out. Log footbridges frequently wash out during the winter or other conditions could be affecting the trail.  Along the Trail Eight hundred year-old Douglas fir trees can be found along the route to Ranger Falls. Backpacking Camping is not permitted due to the lake's popularity with day hikers and its proximity to the trail. Current trail conditions are available park-wide from wilderness information centers, ranger stations, and visitor centers. Fires are prohibited. No pets on trails. Treat water before drinking.",
