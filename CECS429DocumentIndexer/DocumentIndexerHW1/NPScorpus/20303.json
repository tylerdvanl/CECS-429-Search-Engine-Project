Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park offers a total of seven different trading cards:          Emma Stephenson  Watching Over Her Soldiers Forever Formerly enslaved Emma Stephenson served as a 17th Army Corps nurse. She fell ill while caring for white soldiers and later died. She was first buried at the Army Corps hospital, but was later interred at the Marietta National Cemetery with \"her soldiers\". Surviving soldiers who had received her care never forgot her kindness.          Austin Gilmore Dying for Duty  Austin Gilmore, formerly enslaved from Tennessee, enlisted in the 111th Illinois Infantry to fight for freedom. A stretcher bearer, Austin removed bodies of wounded and dead soldiers during the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain. He was mortally wounded rescuing a soldier, died four days later, and was buried in an unmarked grave.            Henry Cole and the Underground Railroad   New Yorker, business owner, and Union spy Henry Green Cole gathered information from free and enslaved blacks. He was known as the \"most dangerous man in Georgia\" and his home became a stop on the Underground Railroad. A tunnel led from his house into the woods that presently comprise Marietta National Cemetery.             Colonel Dan McCook From a Family of Fighters   Ohio's \"Fighting\" McCooks sent many of their sons to fight in the Civil War. Thirteen served in the Union Army, six becoming generals during the conflict. Colonel Dan McCook died at the Dead Angle at Kennesaw Mountain. In 1914, fifty years later, a monument to the McCook Brigade was dedicated near where he fell.          A Picture Speaks a Thousand Words Combat artists' drawings were used to illustrate newspaper and magazine articles throughout the war. One of the most famous combat artists was Alfred Waud. His accurate drawings, like \"Kennesaw's Bombardment, 64\", helped people understand the horrors of war. Many of Waud's works were featured in the popular illustrated magazine Harper's Weekly.          Fire on the Battlefield A Humanitarian Act  During the savage fighting at Cheatham Hill, a small brush fire became a full blaze. The screams of wounded Union soldiers trapped by fire were heard above the roar of battle. Confederate officer Lieutenant Colonel William H. Martin waved a white cloth, ordering his men to stop fighting and help rescue the Union soldiers.          The Battle of Kennesaw Mountain Delaying the Advance on Atlanta  In late June 1864, General Joseph Johnston's Confederate forces delayed the Union's advance towards Atlanta for two weeks. Fortunately for the Union Army commanded by General William T. Sherman, the delay was not enough. The fall of Atlanta on September 2 helped ensure the re-election of President Abraham Lincoln in November of that year.  Back to Top",
