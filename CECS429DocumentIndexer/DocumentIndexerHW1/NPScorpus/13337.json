    "body": "Hetch Hetchy        Hetch Hetchy Reservoir Clarisa Flores       Hidden in Yosemite National Park’s peaceful northwest corner, Hetch Hetchy Valley is a treasure worth visiting in all seasons. Located at 3,900 feet, Hetch Hetchy boasts one of the longest hiking seasons in the park and is an ideal place for thundering spring waterfalls and wildflower displays. High temperatures prevail in summer months, but that is a small price to pay for the reward of vast wilderness filled with stunning peaks, hidden canyons, and remote lakes.      To Get There   Car: The Hetch Hetchy parking lot is 38 miles (1 hour, 15 minutes) from Yosemite Valley. The Hetch Hetchy Road begins just outside of the park on Highway 120, near the Big Oak Flat Entrance Station. This road has seasonal hours corresponding roughly with daylight hours. There is no access to Hetch Hetchy trailheads when road is closed.   Bus: There is no public transportation to Hetch Hetchy.        Activites  Backpacking (spring to fall) Birdwatching (all year) Fishing (all year) Hiking (spring to fall) Stock Use (spring to fall)       Points of Interest          The O’Shaughnessy Dam was completed in 1938. Today the 117-billion-gallon reservoir supplies drinking water to 2.4 million Bay Area residents and hydro-electric power generated by two plants downstream.          Wapama Fall is reached via a five-mile, round-trip hike that follows the shoreline of the reservoir with moderate up and downhill hiking. The trail includes spectacular views of Tueeulala and Wapama Falls. To begin the trail, cross the dam and pass through the tunnel.          Smith Peak (7,751 feet) is the highest point in the area and offers outstanding views. It has two trailhead options. One route begins six miles beyond the entrance station. This trail is 13 miles round-trip with 3,700 feet elevation gain. The other route begins at the entrance station and is 16 miles round-trip with 3,300 feet of elevation gain.           The Poopenaut Trail begins at a signed trailhead four miles past the entrance station. This strenuous 2.5-mile, round-trip hike to the Tuolumne River has 1,229 feet of elevation gain.",
