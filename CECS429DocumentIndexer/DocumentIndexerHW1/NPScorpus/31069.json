    "body": "The Longest Stretch of Undeveloped Barrier Island in The World  Padre Island National Seashore separates the Gulf of Mexico from the Laguna Madre, one of a few hypersaline lagoons in the world.  The park protects 70 miles of coastline, dunes, prairies, and wind tidal flats teeming with life.  It is a safe nesting ground for the Kemp’s ridley sea turtle and a haven for 380 bird species.  It also has a rich history, including the Spanish shipwrecks of 1554.                History and Culture   Visiting the vast beaches, dunes and coastal prairies of Padre Island National Seashore can be like traveling back in time.         Birds of Padre Island National Seashore   Some birds live in the seashore year round, others seasonally, and many visit for just a few days on their way north or south.        Protecting Sea turtles   Padre Island National Seashore is a part of the global effort to help recover populations of threatened and endangered sea turtles.",
