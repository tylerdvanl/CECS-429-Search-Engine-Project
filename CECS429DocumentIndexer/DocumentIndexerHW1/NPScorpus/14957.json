From the grassroots efforts—spearheaded by the Manzanar Committee that created the site to the Congressionally-authorized Manzanar Advisory Commission and scores of community meetings and comments, a broad spectrum of experiences and perspectives have shaped Manzanar. Many of Manzanar's planning efforts have focused on site preservation and development. Others relate to exhibits, audio-visual media, and publications to help visitors understand the site and its stories. Friends of Manzanar www.friendsofmanzanar.org has pledged to partner with the National Park Service to fundraise to reconstruct the women's latrine in Block 14. Current buildings in Block 14 include two reconstructed barracks and a restored World War II-era mess hall. All three feature exhibits on the challenges and changes Japanese Americans faced on a daily basis. We invite you to take an active role in park planning. Since 2005, the National Park Service has been using a web-based public comment site Planning, Environment, and Public Comment (PEPC), where you can read about proposed projects and plans in parks, and add your comments electronically. In January 2015, Manzanar staff embarked on a Foundation Document development process. A Foundation Document articulates a shared understanding of important resources and values and provides a basis for planning. Along with Manzanar's 1997 General Management Plan, the Foundation Document will help guide park planning and management. Park staff are hosting a series of \"Open House\" meetings in Los Angeles, the Owens Valley, and Las Vegas to review the draft Foundation Document. Those wishing to submit written comments can do so via email to e-mail us or by writing to Superintendent Bernadette Johnson, Manzanar NHS, PO Box 426, Independence, CA93526. Comments are requested no later than September 15, 2015 Completed Planning Documents  In June, 2015, we invited stakeholders to review a draft of our new park brochure. The brochure is intended to be evocative as well as informational. We appreciate all those who took time to share their insights and suggestions. The final brochure will be available in Spring 2016.          Manzanar's Museum Management Plan (2012) identifies the key collection issues facing the park, and presents a series of recommendations to address those issues. The Orchard Management Plan (2010) provides objectives and guidance for the management of park orchards. Recommendations call for the restoration and rehabilitation of portions of five town-era orchards. Manzanar's Long Range Interpretive Plan (2007) provides interpretive direction for the park that was developed with public input and involvement. The park is engaged in the long-term process of realizing the visions outlined in this plan, as well as in the site's General Management Plan (1996). Manzanar's  Cultural Landscape Report (2006) provides recommendations for the park landscape as a whole. These recommendations provide a broad framework for future treatment with some specific examples.",
