On the weekend of August 29-31, 2014, a total 287 species of plants and animals were identified by a group of 57 professional scientists, naturalists, citizen scientists, volunteers, and park staff. The total number and diversity of the species documented were only limited by the number of taxonomic experts leading survey groups and a relatively abbreviated planning period. Volunteer interest level was high for such a small-scale BioBlitz event and participant comments indicated it was an enjoyable and productive outing that yielded many stories of wildlife encounters and backcountry adventure.
