    "body": "Henry Kyd Douglas Collection          Henry Kyd Douglas was on Gen. Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson's staff in the Maryland Campaign. He was a great asset to the Confederate leadership at Antietam because he grew up about four miles from the battlefield. His childhood home \"Ferry Hill\" still stands above the Potomac River and is owned by the C.& O. National Historic Park. Douglas served throughout the war in the eastern theater, was captured at Gettysburg and reached the rank of Colonel. After the war Douglas worked as a lawyer in Hagerstown, Maryland, and was active in the Maryland National Guard. He wrote his memoirs, \"I Rode With Stonewall\" and was instrumental in the creation of the Confederate Cemetery in Hagerstown where the Confederate remains on the battlefield were re-burried. Douglas died in 1903 and is buried in Shepherdstown, West Virginia.  Â                 Douglas Collection   3 Photos  Images of Henry Kyd Douglas, Confederate Staff Officer, artifacts.
