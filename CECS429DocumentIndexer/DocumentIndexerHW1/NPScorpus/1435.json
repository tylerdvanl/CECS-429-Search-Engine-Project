    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Permits & Reservations     Scattering Ashes                Scattering Ashes       A permit is required from the Chief Ranger's Office to scatter ashes in the park. There is no charge for the permit. The guidelines below need to be keep in mind when filling out the request:  1. There are no designated sites for scattering of ashes, but the location you choose must be away from developed areas (parking lots, trailheads, campgrounds, picnic areas) and at least 200 feet (70 adult steps) from any water source such as a lake or stream.  2. Discretion should be exercised in spreading ashes;doing so is generally a very private moment and care should be given not to disturb other park users.  3. Ashes should be spread about and not buried or placed in a pile.  4. No markers, cairns, displays, signs, or plaques may be placed in the park.  5. We suggest early in the morning as a good time of day for your memorial as the afternoons are usually more crowded and afford less privacy and solitude.    Once you receive the letter we ask that you keep it with you during your duration in the Park. If you are unfamiliar with Rocky Mountain National Park, we have listed a few scenic areas to have a scattering of ashes ceremony.   Recommended meadows: Upper Beaver Meadows, Mill Creek Basin, Moraine Park, or Horseshoe Park (note: seasonal closures).   Recommended Areas on Trail Ridge Road (closed mid-October to June): Ute Trail, Medicine Bow Curve.   You must still be 200 feet from water at these locations. Other sites may be requested;these are just a few recommendations.     Download an Application for Scattering Ashes.    Please email questions.",
