They must be leashed at all times and their waste disposed of properly. Picking up after a pet is not only one of the rules, but also a kind gesture to other hikers and wildlife living in the area, to whom pet waste can be harmful. Pet Waste Stations with disposal bags are conveniently located at the visitor center and campground. Pets are not permitted in the visitor center.",
