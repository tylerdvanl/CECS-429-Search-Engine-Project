    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Things To Do     Outdoor Activities     Bicycling                Bicycling      Bicycling is permitted along Skyline Drive and on paved areas in the park. Bicycling (road and mountain bikes) is not permitted on trails, unpaved roads or in grassy areas.* Because Skyline Drive is a two-lane road with steep hills and numerous blind curves, bicyclers are urged to use extreme caution. Visitors should be prepared to operate their bicycles during periods of low visibility, or while traveling through a tunnel, or between sunset and sunrise, by exhibiting on the operator or bicycle a white light or reflector that is visible from a distance of at least 500 feet to the front and with a red light or reflector visible from at least 200 feet to the rear.  During periods of fog, reflectors will not provide necessary safety for bicyclists.  Lights on both the front and rear of the bicycle are required.   Mountain areas can experience dramatically different weather than what is being experienced in the lowlands, so be prepared! *Bicycling from Skyline Drive is permitted on Rapidan Fire Road for approximately one mile. At the end of this mile, there is a sign indicating no bicycles are permitted beyond that point. Several commercial businesses are permitted to offer guided bicycle trips in Shenandoah National Park.",
