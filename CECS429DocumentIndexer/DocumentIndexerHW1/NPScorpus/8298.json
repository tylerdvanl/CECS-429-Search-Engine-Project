The start and end of the loop is at the Buxton Woods Picnic Area.        Open Ponds Trail National Park Service  Open Ponds Trail 4.5 miles one direction (9 miles round-trip)  This trail, part of the Mountains to Sea Trail, traverses dunes, shrub thickets, and maritime forests of Hatteras Island as it winds its way between British Cemetery near the Buxton Woods Picnic Area and Trailhead and the Frisco Campground.        Boardwalk at the Pamlico Sound National Park Service  Hammock Hills Trail 3\/4 mile loop  This trail, found just across from the entrance to the Ocracoke Campground, leads you from the dunes and scrub thickets, though the maritime forest, and to the salt marsh and views of the Pamlico Sound, before looping back through the forest.",
