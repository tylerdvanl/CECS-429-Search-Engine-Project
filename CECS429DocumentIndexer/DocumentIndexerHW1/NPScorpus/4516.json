Due to time constraints, Ferry and seaplane day visitors will not have time to visit Loggerhead Key.   To visit other areas of the park you must have your own mode of transportation and file a free boat permit with the park when you arrive.   Bringing your own boat to the Dry Tortugas National Park will provide you with the most opportunities to explore this remarkable national treasure.   If you plan on camping consider bringing a kayak or canoe. This will provide you with access to other areas of the park such as Loggerhead Key and great snorkeling sites. If you plan to take the Yankee Freedom Ferry, all camping plans including bringing a kayak must be coordinated through the ferry.  There are no boat rental services of any kind available in the park.",
