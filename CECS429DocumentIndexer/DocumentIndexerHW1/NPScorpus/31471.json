Updated: 11\/8\/2013 Mission Portals connect San Antonio's four historic missions – Mission Concepción, Mission San Jose, Mission San Juan and Mission Espada – to the San Antonio River. These connections feature historic and artistic interpretations of the story of the missions and highlight their social and cultural importance to the area. This reinforces the importance of the river to the missions and encourages visitors to circulate between the Mission Riverwalk and the river. Project planners worked closely with the National Park Service to ensure that there would be a seamless transition between the Mission Riverwalk and the historic missions. Ask a Ranger or Docent at one of the missions for additional information. Transportation map Mission Riverwalk map        Calboxes on trail   Wending along side the San Antonio River, through old neighborhoods and farmlands, the Mission Hike and Bike Trail provides respite from the daily pressure and grind of city life. From Mission Concepción to Mission Espada, eight (8) miles of dedicated paved pathways are reserved for the hiker and biker. An easy walk or ride, it is suitable for even young members of the family. The trail is not a loop, so the round-trip path is actually 16 miles. However, walkers and bikers can start at any of the four missions and travel to the next mission, making the round trip only six (6) miles. Water is available at each mission. Food is available near Missions Concepción and San José, but not near Missions San Juan and Espada, so plan accordingly. For safety, please wear a helmet",
