This plan will provide direction for managing the park and preserve over the next 15 to 20 years.  As part of the general management planning process, we invited comments on the preliminary alternatives that were developed last summer. Many of you read newsletter #2 in the fall of 2010, attended a public meeting during the fall or winter, or wrote a letter to share you opinions on the preliminary alternatives. In newsletter #3, a summary of the comments that you shared is provided, along with a description of how your ideas are being incorporated into the draft alternatives.  In addition, newsletter #3 provides some information on the wilderness study that is part of our planning efforts. We describe the components and process for this wilderness study, and have included maps that show you where the wilderness study options are located. Like the preliminary GMP alternatives, the wilderness study is in draft form.
