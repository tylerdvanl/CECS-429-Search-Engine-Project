Watch this Oregon Field Guide episode for an excellent introduction into the Bull Trout problems at Crater Lake National Park:    The \"Saving the Bull Trout of Sun Creek\" segment was first broadcast in 2001.    Sun Creek, a headwater stream in Crater Lake National Park, contains a population of Endangered Species Act listed, native Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus) recovering from decades of competition with nonnative Brook Trout (S. fontinalis). The National Park Service (NPS) eradicated Brook Trout from upper Sun Creek during the early 2000s. Bull trout have gradually expanded to occupy vacant habitat in the stream, but many areas that once contained high densities of Brook Trout remain only sparsely populated by Bull Trout. Current management actions will eradicate nonnative trout from the lower portion of the Sun Creek watershed and create additional vacant habitat for Bull Trout.",
