    "body": "September 14, 1901       President William McKinley succumbed to his injuries at the John Milburn home on September 14, 1901. His death was attributed to \"gangrene of both walls of the stomach and pancreas.\"  Theodore Roosevelt arrived in Buffalo at 1:30 PM. He was met at the train station by Ansley Wilcox and brought back to this home. After  a visit to the Milburn home to pay his respects to Mrs. McKinley, Roosevelt returned to the Wilcox house for the inauguration. This site was chosen by Roosevelt as the most appropriate place for the ceremony. It took place in the Wilcox library at approximately 3:30 PM. A small crowd was assembled including a few newspaper reporters who were allowed to take notes. The photographers were barred from the room until after the ceremony. Roosevelt wore formal clothing borrowed from some of the guests who were present. The oath was administered by Federal District Judge John R. Hazel. Immediately following the swearing-in, Roosevelt held a brief cabinet meeting in the library and then proceeded to the morning room to issue his first presidential proclamation.",
