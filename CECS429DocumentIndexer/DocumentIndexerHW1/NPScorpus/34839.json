Visitors may see mule deer browsing, hear the falling notes of a canyon wren, or smell the sweet aroma of spring wildfl owers. To guard these experiences for future generations, please observe the following regulations:      Pets are not allowed on hiking trails.  Do not climb or walk across the bridges. Protect cryptobiotic soil crusts by staying on trails.  Writing or carving on rocks is graffiti and is illegal. Leave water for wildlife: do not disturb pools or intermittent streams by bathing or swimming.  Do not enter archeological sites, touch rock art, or disturb artifacts. Once removed from context, the story they can tell is gone forever. Camping is permitted only in the campground.  Vehicles and bicycles must remain on designated roads.  Vehicles may not be left unattended overnight along the loop road.  The use of unmanned aircraft (drones) is prohibited to protect public safety, minimize visitor-use conflicts, and prevent unacceptable impacts to scenic values, natural soundscapes, and wildlife.   Additional laws & policies guiding the management of Natural Bridges may be found here.",
