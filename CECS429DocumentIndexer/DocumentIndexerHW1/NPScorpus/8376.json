    "body": "Commercial Use Authorizations       Commercial use authorizations (CUAs) are one method of authorizing commercial visitor services.  The maximum term for CUAs at CALO is one year. There is no right or guarantee of renewal. Permittee must reapply for a new CUA for succeeding periods upon expiration of the current CUA. CUAs are issued for a yearly fee. The current fee is $475. An application fee of $75 applies. (non-refundable) CUAs are not considered concession contracts. These services need not be \"necessary\" but are \"appropriate\" services that may enhance the visitor experience, and have been determined to have minimal impact on resources and park values. Commercial business activity is prohibited within the park unless a CUA has been granted by the park (36 CFR Sec. 5.3).    CUA Directory -- Find contact information for current Commercial Use Authorization (CUA) holders           Commercial Use Authorization Information Park-Specific Provisions CUAs apply only to those federal parks, preserves, monuments, and historic sites administered by the National Park Service (NPS). CUA Fees The authority for the National Park Service (NPS) to impose user charges to recover and retain costs associated with managing special park uses is found in 31 U.S.C. 9701 and 16 U.S.C. 3a. Fees for CUAs are non-refundable. Monitoring fees may apply. The monitoring fee is determined by tracking how much it actually costs the park to monitor and\/or perform needed functions to properly manage the commercial use. If applicable, you will receive a bill for collection for the monitoring fee. CUA Application and Yearly Fees: This fee covers the costs associated with the administrative process of preparing and issuing the CUA, including National Environmental Policy Act and cultural compliance approval if applicable. This fee includes the cost of operating. The CUA fee and application fee should be submitted along with your application form. Make your remittance payable to the National Park Service. The 2015 fee is $475. All CUAs will be written to expire on December 31, 2015. Liability Insurance The NPS requires all permittees to carry liability insurance. A sample certificate is available in the list below. Reporting Requirements Annual Survey Report: The annual survey report (Attachment D of the permit) for 2014 CUAs is due by January 15, 2015 (submit this form after your season of operation).
