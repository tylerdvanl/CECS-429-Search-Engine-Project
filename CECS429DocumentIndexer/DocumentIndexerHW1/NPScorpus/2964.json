    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility     Service Animals              Service Animals         NPS  Service animals are allowed in national parks. For a definition of a service animal, please see the Americans with Disability Act (ADA) defnition. For information on animals that do not qualify as service animals, please see our information on pets in the park. Anywhere that you wish to go, your service animal may go, too. Fully-trained service animals are permitted in all park facilities, along park trails, and in the wilderness area. A service animal must be under the control of its handler at all times. Trash cans for disposing of animal waste are found throughout the park; however, there are no plastic bags provided, so please remember to bring your own.",
