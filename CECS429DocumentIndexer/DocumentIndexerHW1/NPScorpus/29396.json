    "body": "Outdoor Activities       TOURING GREEN! Bicycling is a fantastic way to view the battlefield. As a vehicle, it allows you to cover the entire battlefield tour with relative ease (OK, some of the hills and rolling terrain may offer a bit of a challenge), while also bringing you closer to the environment through which you travel. And, bicycles are healthy for the cyclist and the environment alike. If you'd like to learn more about touring the battlefield by bicycle, and even about traveling to the battlefield by bicycle, a local organization, \"Bike Saratoga,\" offers some ideas.  REMEMBER: entrance fees for touring the battlefield ALSO apply to bicyclists. Stop at the Visitor Center to get your pass before doing the battlefield tour.",
