    "body": "Whiskeytown Is More Than A Beautiful Lake  Whiskeytown Lake’s beautiful crystal-clear waters, surrounded by mountain peaks, are perhaps the most prominent feature of the park.  However, water-based recreation is only a small part of what the park has to offer. The 39,000 acres surrounding the lake hold four waterfalls, pristine mountain creeks, 70 miles of trails, and opportunities to explore the history of the California Gold Rush.                Every Kid in a Park   Whiskeytown NRA invites all 4th grade students to visit the park for free as part of the White House's new Every Kid in a Park program.
