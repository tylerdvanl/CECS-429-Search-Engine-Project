In small tributaries, the most abundant species of fish include minnows, darters, bass, and bullhead catfish. This pattern shifts in larger tributaries, which are dominated by channel, blue, and flathead catfish; sunfishes; largemouth and spotted bass; and crappie. During droughts, several saltwater fish species may be seen below the Neches River saltwater barrier on the eastern boundary of Beaumont as salty ocean waters push their way up the Neches above Sabine Lake.",
