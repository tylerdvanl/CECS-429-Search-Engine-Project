Photo by Raptor Biologist Gavin Emmons  Raptor Advisories Have Been Lifted For 2016; Temporary Closure Still In Effect At Machete Ridge All raptor advisory areas are open to visitors as of the effective date of June 25, 2016. PLEASE NOTE: The temporary closure at the south end of Machete Ridge is still in effect. For more information on advisories at Pinnacles, please visit the Friends of Pinnacles and Mud N' Crud websites. This season, 19 prairie falcon young fledged from 5 nests and one additional nest failed, likely due to predation. Twenty-eight additional raptor nests were documented this year, including 2 peregrine falcon nests, 7 red-tailed and 3 red-shouldered hawk nests, 3 Cooper's hawk nests, 2 long-eared owl nests, and a great horned owl nest. Prairie falcon productivity in 2016 was lower than the 31-year average for the raptor monitoring program at Pinnacles, and climbers and hikers did an excellent job of assisting park managers in the protection of  the spectacular birds of prey at Pinnacles. For more information about raptors at the park, please view the breeding season report below. 2015 Breeding Season Report - Falcons. 2014 Breeding Season Report - Falcons. 2013 Breeding Season Report - Falcons. 2012 Breeding Season Report - Falcons. 2011 Breeding Season Report. 2010 Breeding Season Report. 2009 Breeding Season Report. 2008 Breeding Season Report. 2007 Breeding Season Report.

Photo by Raptor Biologist Gavin Emmons  Raptor Advisory Information To maximize the potential of successful nest establishment, Pinnacles National Park requests that all visitors refrain from rock climbing and off-trail hiking in sensitive areas during the advisory periods. These protective measures usually remain in effect until June or July. However, as nesting activity is monitored by Park staff, additional sensitive areas may be identified and listed. Some areas may also be opened. Please check with a ranger or carefully examine the Climbing Information Bulletin Board as you plan you climbing and hiking trips. This advisory does not affect hiking along the Park's primary trail system. All designated trails will remain fully accessible by park visitors. Climbers should continue to use designated \"Climber Access Routes\" in all areas of the Park. Special care is requested for those areas most heavily impacted by climbing: Discovery Wall, Elephant Rock, Machete, Upper Crust, the Camel, and the Sisters. Please remember that intentionally disturbing wildlife nesting, breeding, and other activities is a violation of Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations (Section 2.2 (a) (2)). The Raptor Advisory System has been in effect since 1988. We would like to thank you for your assistance in protecting these magnificent birds. By coming to Pinnacles and following these recommendations, you become a partner in managing the Park's resources. You are a vital component to the success of maintaining raptors. Without your cooperation, park staff could not protect the natural resources. You help make Pinnacles a special place.",
