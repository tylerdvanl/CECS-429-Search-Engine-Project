The Thomas Condon Paleontology Center is named for the first man to recognize the importance of the John Day Fossil Beds. Thomas Condon, an early Oregon minister and self-trained scientist, was the first person to identify this region as a world class paleontological site. He first learned of the area's abundant fossils from soldiers in 1862 Condon ministered to at a church he had established in The Dalles, Oregon. In 1865, he visited the basin for the first time and started excavating fossils. The specimens he sent to eastern museums for verification ignited scientific interest, and in recognition of his scientific work, Condon was appointed the first Oregon State Geologist in 1872. He would later become a professor of geology at the University of Oregon. He held the position until his death in 1907.  Â      \"Evolution was simply Gods method of working, and therefore not atheistic or infidel.\" - Thomas Condon   The Pioneer Missionary as Scientist Thomas Condon believed that religion and modern science went hand in hand - that science was a means to understand the spectacular nature of Gods creation. \"The Hills from which these evidences were taken\", he wrote in reference to the evolutionary record of the fossil beds, \"were made by the same God who made the hills of Judea, and the evidences are as authoritative. The Church has nothing to fear from the uncovering of truth.\"",
