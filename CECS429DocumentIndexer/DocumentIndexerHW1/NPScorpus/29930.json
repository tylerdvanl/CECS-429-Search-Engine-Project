In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act, the NPS will prepare a Breach Plan\/EIS to provide a thorough evaluation to determine the potential benefits and consequences of management strategies prior to making a decision on how to manage the wilderness breach.  A public scoping period was open from August 31 through October 8, 2015. Public scoping is the first step in the EIS planning process and informs the development of a draft plan. A Draft Plan\/EIS is expected to be available for public review and comment late summer, 2016.  Your participation is vital at each step of the process to ensure that we consider all stakeholders' issues and concerns, and to be sure that we capture all issues regarding the comprehensive preservation and management of park resources-both for today and for future generations.
