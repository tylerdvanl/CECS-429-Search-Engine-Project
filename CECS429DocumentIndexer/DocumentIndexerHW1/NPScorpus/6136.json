    "body": "Explore This Park    Get Involved     Support Your Park             Support Your Park       Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site is a wonderful place to visit, but visiting the site is not the only way to benefit from it. If you are interested in taking a more active role in supporting the park, there are multiple opportunities for you to become more involved.  The Friends of Saint-Gaudens The Friends of Saint-Gaudens was formed by the Saint-Gaudens Memorial to help support the park and celebrate the life and work of Augustus Saint-Gaudens. The Friends work with the National Park Service to create interesting and exciting events for visitors to attend, such as the Sculptural Visions event, sculpture workshops, summer concerts, contemporary art exhibits, and even special bus tours. To find out more about the Friends organization, please see their website at www.sgnhs.org. Volunteer-in-the-Park The Volunteer-in-the-Park (VIP) program is a great way for those wanting to donate their time, energy, resources, and talents to the park. Saint-Gaudens provides some exciting volunteer opportunities to learn more about the history of Saint-Gaudens as well as practical work skills and knowledge and venues to meet new people.  Donate The park may accept donations from individuals, families, organizations, foundations, corporations, businesses, associations and other entities. Your gift will be used to support the preservation and programs of the only national park in the country dedicated to American sculpture. No other federal agency relies as heavily on the generosity and kindness of its visitors, and we thank you for your past support and look forward to future cooperation.  Eastern National Bookstore The Eastern National Bookstore, the park's museum shop, sells a variety of items that not only promote the park's history and culture, but also concern art, children's activities, wildlife, music, and much more.",
