Miller  Parashant National Monument remains one of the most remote areas in the contiguous United States. The monument and surrounding geographic region are recognized for remarkable combinations of high elevation plateaus, excellent air quality, sparse population and prevalent cloud-free weather all of which provide for some of the best opportunities to visually observe and enjoy dark night skies. Natural darkness and dark night skies are important resources and recognized monument objects of Parashant. Dark night skies are a rapidly disappearing resource around the world as inefficient and ineffective light sources increase. By working with the National Park Service Colorado Plateau Dark Sky Cooperative the monument was able to produce an inventory of the existing night sky conditions and obtain a Gold-tier status from the International Dark-Sky Association. Data from this inventory and future studies will be used for future monitoring on the monument.   Astronomical Calendar",
