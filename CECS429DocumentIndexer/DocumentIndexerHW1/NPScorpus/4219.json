Boaters can view birds, dolphins, manatees, and other wildlife as they travel the waters. The Wilderness Waterway Trail begins here.  This water trail is used by canoers, kayakers, and powerboaters.  The trail is 99 miles long and terminates at Flamingo.  Most paddlers allow at least eight days to complete the trip.  All users should remember that it is a wilderness trail that should only be used by experienced boaters.  It can be confusing and difficult to navigate as the mazes of mangrove-lined creeks and bays all begin to look the same. For more information, consult nautical charts and the parks Wilderness Trip Planner.  For shorter paddling trips, canoers and kayakers can paddle up Halfway Creek, Turner River, over to Sandfly Island and through the Ten Thousand Islands.  There are no hiking trails at the Gulf Coast Visitor Center, although nearby areas such as Fakahatchee Strand Preserve and Big Cypress National Preserve offer some wonderful trails.",
