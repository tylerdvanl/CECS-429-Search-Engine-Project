There are five climatic zones ranging from alpine areas to high desert. These zones create climatic conditions where a wide range of animals thrive. Everything from magnificent herds of Pryor Mountain wild horses to the park's namesake Bighorn sheep, visitors can see an array of wildlife in a relatively small area. Consider these facts: Did You Know?  Bighorn Rams, which weigh up to 300 pounds, can reach speeds up to 40 mph when clashing during mating season. Mule deer can jump an 8 foot fence and can perform a running long jump up to 25 feet. Black bears do not hibernate during the winter, but they do enter a deep sleep. Pryor Mountain horses have strong Spanish ancestry and are considered a unique genetic resource since horses of this type are no longer present in Spain.  Click on the above links to learn more!
