    "body": "OZ-Operation Zero          Ahoy! Experience Lake Mead in a way you never have before. Join the “OZ CREW” and be a hero, take pollution down to zero. Come enjoy a day on the lake with your co-workers, friends, or family while helping protect your park and environment with Operation Zero, Citizens Removing & Eliminating Waste. The OZ CREW goal is to engage community groups and families to experience Lake Mead National Recreation Area while working together to keep our national park clean. Aboard OZ we will travel to a cove accessible only by boat, and spend 2-2½ hours picking up and bagging litter. On the day of the voyage, the journey begins in the morning.  NPS staff will provide an overview of the day including vessel safety and instructions. During the clean-up the OZ CREW will have an opportunity to explore the area or just take in the majestic scenery, including the mountain coves, and wildlife. The excursion will end early in the afternoon when OZ returns to the launch site, the bags of trash are disposed of, and the boat is cleaned and readied for the next trip.
