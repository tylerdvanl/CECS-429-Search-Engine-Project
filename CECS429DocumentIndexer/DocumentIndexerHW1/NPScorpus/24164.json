    "body": "Shedding Light on the Mogollon Culture  For thousands of years, groups of nomadic people used the caves of the Gila River as temporary shelter. In the late 1200's, people of the Mogollon Culture decided it would be a good place to call home. They built rooms, crafted pottery and raised children in the cliff dwellings for about twenty years. Then the Mogollon moved on, leaving the walls for us as a glimpse into the past.                Plan Your Visit   Getting here is half the fun! Give yourself time to reach the park and enjoy the scenery! Better yet, plan on staying for a few days.
