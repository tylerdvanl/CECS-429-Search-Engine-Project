NPS Photo \/ Mike Plummer-Steen   Â    Grand Portage National Monument has a wealth of opportunities for teachers, scout and youth leaders. Whether you're planning a park visit for your students or looking for other resources to use in your classroom or home, or hoping to have a ranger guided program, we've got it.   Think of your National Parks as off-site classrooms! There are many ways to utilize America's treasures as teaching tools. After all, we have \"the real thing,\" and we love to work with you to teach students the importance of the special places we all work together to preserve and protect for the future.",
