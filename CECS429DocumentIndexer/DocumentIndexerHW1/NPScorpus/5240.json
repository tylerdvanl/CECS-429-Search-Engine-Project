We also want you to treat the resources here with care, so that future generations may enjoy them as well. DESERT SAFETY The desert can be a harsh and unforgiving environment, especially if you are not accustomed to it. Make sure to drink plenty of water, at least a gallon per person per day. Make sure to eat during the day to help electrolyte replacement. Wear a hat, sunglasses, light clothing and comfortable shoes. Use sunscreen and avoid strenuous activities during the hottest parts of the day. FLASH FLOODS Flash floods do occur in the canyons of the park.  Travel into the canyons may be restricted due to flash floods or high water levels.  Even if the skies above you are clear, a storm just miles away may trigger a flash flood. Check the local weather forecast and water levels before entering the canyon at your own risk.",
