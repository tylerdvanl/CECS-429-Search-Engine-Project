Explore the dunes and enjoy the silence and solitude of the dunefield with its stunning views of the surrounding mountains. The trails vary in terms of difficulty and scenery. Plan ahead to ensure you have a great and safe hike. If you are new to the monument, consult with rangers at the visitor center before heading out on your hike. Rangers will provide advice about trails as well as recommendations for different fitness and experience levels. It is recommended that you do not start a hike if the temperature is at or above 85°F (30°C). Each of our trails is marked with a specific colored post (i.e., green, blue, orange, or red) and a symbol (i.e., hearts, clubs, spades, or diamonds). Please familiarize yourself with these colors and symbols to help orient yourself to the trail before you start your hike. This information will be critical if you become lost. The Interdune Boardwalk is the only trail with no colored posts or symbol.          NPS Photo  Hiking Safety Tips Exploring the outdoors comes with risks.
