    "body": "Service Learning Opportunities       There are opportunities for students to learn from and work with park staff as part of a service learning project. These projects are a great way for students to acquire skills, practice stewardship, and learn first-hand about park resources and the importance of protecting and restoring them, and meet their community service graduation requirements. Previous service learning projects include working with the park's revegetation and invasive plant eradication crews to replant damaged areas or removing invasive plants, working with the park's trail crew to construct, repair or maintain trails (one class from Seattle helped finish the last mile of the Wonderland Trail), and litter collection to protect wildlife. Smaller groups can participate in resource inventory and monitoring projects, translating scientific research for the general public, and web- or technology-based projects. Project availability is determined by park needs and staff availability. Free camping is available for groups participating in a service learning project. When planning a project, consider your students' age(s) and their physical abilities. While rewarding, service learning projects often involve physical labor. Call the Education Office at (360)569-6038 to explore the options.",
