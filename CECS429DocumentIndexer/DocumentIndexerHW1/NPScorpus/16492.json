    "body": "Yellowstone In Depth Video Series       What have we discovered about Yellowstone's wildlife, geysers, and other natural features? How can we learn from the park's history to help us protect its future? In this video series, explore Yellowstone's most popular questions and important issues with park rangers, scientists, historians and park visitors. Discover more about the world's first national park: experience Yellowstone In Depth.           Predicting Old Faithful Old Faithful was once called \"Eternity's Timepiece\" because of the regularity of its eruptions. However, this geyser has never erupted at exact hourly intervals as many believe. Ranger Darlene Bos explains how we predict eruptions for this popular geyser.            Watershed Down Snowfall in Yellowstone melts into rivers that span the continent from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean. Scientists are documenting significant changes in the amount of snow that falls here as well as the intensity and timing of spring runoff. These trends could affect everything you see when you come to the park, as well as everyone and everything living downstream.            Bison Yellowstone preserves the most important bison herd in the United States. Learn more about the near extinction and recovery of these remarkable animals, how they make it through harsh winters, and what their survival says about our ability to share the landscape with another species.             Geysers With over half the world's geysers, Yellowstone offers tremendous opportunities to see these geologic wonders in action. Explore the mechanics of geysers, their role in the park's history and what they teach us about the world in which we live.           Mountain Goats in Yellowstone The mountain goat is not native to Yellowstone: it entered the park from areas to the north where it was introduced for hunting purposes. In this video, researches reveal how mountain goats have become a threat to bighorn sheep and alpine vegetation since migrating into the park.            Voices of Yellowstone Many people come to Yellowstone to see the fantastic landscapes. Wise visitors also come to experience the amazing soundscapes. This video provides some insight into the value of natural sounds in wild places and how the park is monitoring those sounds as well as the sounds created by humans.           Generation W: The Generation of the Wolf Kids these days rule their world.

Discover how this generation of wolves is transforming our understanding of the natural world.            Bears - A Yellowstone Love Story Everyone loves the bears in Yellowstone. In the park's early years, people fed them along the roadside and they learned to beg and scavenge at hotels, campgrounds, and the park's garbage dumps. But was the era of the \"beggar bear\" ultimately good for the people or the bears? Find out how this love affair has evolved over time.           Troubled Waters On the surface, Yellowstone's waters look placid and pristine. But look closer-things aren't quite what they seem. There's trouble in the waters: Aquatic invaders-including fish, parasites, and snails-are moving in on native species. Follow three scientists as they search for answers in restoring health to Yellowstone's lakes and rivers.           Yellowstone's Restless Giant The Yellowstone supervolcano is one of our planet's restless giants. For scientists, the question is not one of whether it will erupt again, but rather, when. Are there signs this giant is reawakening? Could it erupt in our lifetimes? Discover how geologists are monitoring the pulse of the Yellowstone volcano.",
