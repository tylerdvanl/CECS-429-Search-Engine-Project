Lee during their first invasion on the North. The success in holding back Union General George B. McClellan's army allowed Lee time to regroup his forces at Sharpsburg, where the Battle of Antietam occurred a few days later.Gettysburg National Military Park The small town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, was the site of the largest battle ever waged in the Western Hemisphere. Fought during July 1863--just 10 months after the Battle of Antietam--this battle resulted in a Union victory that marked a major turning point in the war. Never again would Lee be able to mount such an offensive attack. Over a three-day period 51,000 soldiers were killed, wounded, or captured.Monocacy National Battlefield  The Battle of Monocacy took place on July 9, 1864, and marked the last time that the Confederacy invaded the North. Although technically a victory for the South, the delay caused by the battle allowed Washington to be reinforced against further invasion.Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historic Park This 185-mile canal towpath, constructed shortly before the Civil War, acted as a superhighway of the 1800s and provided access between the 3.5 million residents living west of the Allegheny Mountains and Washington, D.C.Civil War Medical Museum In addition to the Pry House Field Hospital Museum located at Antietam, the main Civil War Medical Museum is located in nearby Frederick.
