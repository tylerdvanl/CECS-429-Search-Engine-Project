    "body": "Directions       Getting to Denali  Address Many rural locations in Alaska use a mile marker on a road to denote their physical address. Denali's entrance is at Mile 237, Highway 3. For people who wish to use a GPS device to navigate their way here, you may need to input the latitude and longitude of the park entrance: 63.728443, -148.886572. You could also try the park's mailing address, of PO Box 9, Denali Park, AK 99755, though this might just drop a location pin in a random spot instead of exactly at the park entrance.   By Car There is one road entrance into Denali. The entrance is along Alaska Highway 3 (also called the George Parks Highway) about 240 miles north of Anchorage, 120 miles south of Fairbanks, and 12 miles south of Healy - the nearest year-round community.  In Talkeetna, about 100 miles north of Anchorage and 140 miles south of the park entrance, you'll find Denali's mountaineering headquarters.   By Train Alaska's state-owned railroad connects Anchorage to Fairbanks, and runs directly through the entrance of Denali. For more information please visit the Alaska Railroad.   By Plane Air travel to either Anchorage (ANC) or Fairbanks (FAI) is the easiest entry to Alaska. Then you'll want to use a car, bus or train to reach Denali. If you are flying your own airplane to Denali, see our pilot information.   Other Transportation In summer a variety of private bus and van services operate daily from Anchorage and Fairbanks. Contact a travel agent or search the web for available companies operating along Highway 3.    Getting Around in Denali The Denali Park Road is open to private vehicles for 14.8 miles to the Savage River Bridge. If you are here without a car, use a free courtesy bus to travel around the entrance area.  Vehicular travel in summer to destinations farther into the park requires shuttle and tour bus services, for which costs vary depending on the nature of the trip. Visitors in spring or fall may find anywhere from 3 to 30 miles of the road open to drive, depending on conditions.  Bicycles and pedestrians are permitted to travel on any part of the park road, barring temporary, wildlife-related closures.   Check out park maps to help orient yourself to the layout of Denali. Though there is just one main road in the park, there are a few side-roads around the park entrance (near the visitor center, train depot and dirt airstrip). Locations on the road are generally referred to by their mile marker as measured from the park entrance (e.g., the Denali Visitor Center is at Mile 1.5 of the road, meaning it is just 1.5 miles from the entrance).    Â    Travel Throughout Alaska  Alaska is a vast landscape, with many popular national parks and other public lands. Check with the Alaska Public Lands Information Center for help planning your journey to other parts of the Great Land.",
