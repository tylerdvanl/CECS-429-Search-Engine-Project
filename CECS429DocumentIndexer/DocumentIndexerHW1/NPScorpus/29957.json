Teachers share their knowledge and perspective with park staff, enhancing future park programs, too.    Â    Fire Island National Seashore's barrier island resources and cultural heritage make for fascinating, place-based study and discovery. The National Park Service-wide Teacher-Ranger-Teacher program links teachers to national parks, providing an opportunity for educators to expand their knowledge base, gain first-hand experience with park rangers and research scientists in the field, and to spend time developing lesson plans for their own classroom. The partnership benefits the participating school district, the educator, and the National Park Service. At Fire Island National Seashore educators work alongside park rangers, interact with visitors, and assist with updating our educational materials and web-based resources. This professional development opportunity requires a minimum time commitment during the summer months, and a stipend is provided. Housing is not available.
