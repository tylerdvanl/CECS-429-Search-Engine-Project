    "body": "Explore This Park    Learn About the Park     Kids & Youth     Be A Junior Ranger              Be A Junior Ranger      Manzanar's Junior Ranger program offers a great opportunity for children to interact with National Park Rangers, experience exhibits, watch the 22-minute film and explore the site. Participants in the program will complete an activity booklet consisting of a dozen activities including a scavenger hunt, word puzzle, word search, mapping and writing activities. These activities highlight Manzanar and Owens Valley history and introduce the peoples who lived at Manzanar.  While many children struggle with the concept of internment, the Junior Ranger program offers one way for them to connect with the story. Children who complete the program will earn a Junior Ranger badge and certificate. Activities are tailored for children between the ages of 4 to 15; however, anyone is welcome to participate.  The Junior Ranger booklet is designed to be done on-site at Manzanar as most activities relate to what you see and hear at the site. However, the Junior Ranger booklet and modified activities could be mailed out if you choose to complete the program from home. Once you have completed the booklet, mail it back to Manzanar National Historic Site, where a Park Ranger will review your booklet and sign your certificate. They will then mail your booklet back to you along with the Manzanar Junior Ranger badge. You can also become a National Park Service WebRanger. .",
