In 2007, Wrangell-St. Elias National Park chose Jona to create their ornament for the White House Christmas Tree. Jona enjoys using native materials, like moose hide, and salmon skin, to create art that reflects her passion for Alaska’s wild places. Jon and Jona Van Zyle are proud to support Glacier Bay national Park’s 2010 Coloring and Creativity Contest. Jon and Jona are both working artists living near Eagle River, Alaska, where they also raise and train Siberian Huskies. Combining art and their love for Alaska, they were chosen to be the first husband and wife team to be Artists-In-Residence at Denali National Park (2004), and Wrangell-St. Elias National Park (2006). Alaska Limited Editions is a proud supporter of our contest. If you would like to learn more about the Van Zyle’s artwork visit: www.jonvanzyle.com.",
