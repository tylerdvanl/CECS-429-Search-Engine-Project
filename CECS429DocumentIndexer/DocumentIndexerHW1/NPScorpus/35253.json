    "body": "Pets and Other Regulations        A hiker enjoys a walk with her pets along the Fremont River Trail. NPS\/Erin Whittaker   Â    Pets are allowed on leash in the developed areas of the park: along paved and dirt roadways, in the picnic area, in the orchards when open, and in the campgrounds. Pets are not permitted on hiking trails, in public buildings, or in the backcountry.  Pets must be restrained at all times on a leash 6 feet (1.8 m) or less in length. There are no kennels in the park and pets may not be left unattended in the campground. Kennel boarding may be found in the surrounding communities. Consider your plans carefully before bringing your pet with you.  Please clean up after your pet and dispose of waste in a dumpster. Important! The desert can be deadly for pets. Car temperatures rise quickly in the sun, even on cool days. Your pet can easily die of heat exhaustion. If you are leaving a pet in a car, crack the windows as much as possible and leave water to drink. We recommend you not leave pets in the car when temperatures are above 68 degrees, even with the windows cracked.  Service Animals Service animals are allowed in national parks. For a definition of a service animal, please go to www.ada.gov\/service_animals_2010.htm.  Service animals are permitted everywhere at Capitol Reef. Owners are encouraged to identify their working service animal, such as with a vest. Identification is not required, but helps prevent unwarranted \"dog on trail\" complaints from other visitors.",
