The first was with the founding of the park in 1933, when the it acquired the collection of the Washington Association of New Jersey.   Twenty-two years later, the park was again the beneficiary of another significant contribution when Lloyd W. Smith bequeathed his substantial archival and book collections to the park. Mr. Smith, an investment banker from Florham Park, NJ, spent nearly half a century collecting and bringing together representative samples of virtually every aspect of our western European cultural heritage.   In addition to the library holdings donated by the Washington Association of New Jersey, Mr. Smith's bequest in 1955 enables the park today to boast a library collection of nearly 50,000 volumes and an archive of nearly 250,000 manuscripts, journals, diaries, account books, letter books, military orderly books, inspection returns, muster lists, and other documents.
