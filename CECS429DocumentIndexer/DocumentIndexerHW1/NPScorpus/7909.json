Volunteers of all ages give of their time and expertise to help achieve the National Park Service mission. In fact, volunteers are vital to the success of the National Park Service! The Volunteers-In-Parks (VIP) program at Blue Ridge Parkway works to preserve the cultural heritage, history, and natural resources of the Parkway through the support of education, interpretation, and resource protection activities. The VIP program helps Parkway staff accomplish more than we could on our own. Volunteers are involved in virtually every aspect of park operations. The Blue Ridge Parkway is divided into four management districts along its 469 mile route through Virginia and North Carolina. Volunteers work regularly in all four districts:  Ridge District (Milepost 0 - 106)  Plateau District (Milepost 106 - 216) Highlands District (Milepost 216 - 331) Pisgah District (Milepost 331-469)  While volunteer needs vary from district to district, the following are examples of some of the types work volunteers can participate in on the Parkway.
