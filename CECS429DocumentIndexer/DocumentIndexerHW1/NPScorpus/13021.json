This also provides a viable foundation for the very rich oak\/hickory forest known as the Snavely Woods. Running through the woods is Antietam Creek, the body of water from which the battle received it's name.Efforts are currently underway to inventory and monitor the water resources, forests communities, plants, animals and soils that comprise Antietam's historic landscape.",
