    "body": "Visitor Services Project         Wind Cave National Park Visitor Center NPS Photo  The Visitor Services Project (VSP) is an ongoing research project of the National Park Service (NPS) Social Science Program that provides superintendents with usable knowledge about visitors. The VSP uses customized questionnaires during a 7- to 10-day period (occasionally longer) that is chosen by park managers. Wind Cave National Park had such a study completed in 2010. Click here for a copy of the report. As part of the VSP project, the park also had an Economic Impact Analysis done. The report uses the Money Generation Model 2 (MGM2), developed specifically for the National Park Service by Dr. Daniel Stynes at Michigan State University, to estimate the economic impacts of park visitor spending. MGM2 uses visitor expenditure data collected in VSP visitor studies along with a county-level, input-output economic model (IMPLAN) to model how money spent by visitors flows through the economy supporting local jobs and businesses.
