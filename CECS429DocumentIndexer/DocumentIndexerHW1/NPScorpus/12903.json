Illustrations by Restoration Design Group for American Rivers   Â     Unhealthy Meadow: Factors of a degraded meadow include: reduced natural storage of water; lowering of groundwater table; flood flows confined to channel with no inundation during floods; disconnect of channel from meadow floodplain; reduced percolation; xeric (or dry) vegetation; incised stream channel with increased sediment transport; and compacted soils.",
