    "body": "Visitor Services       The purpose of the National Park Service’s interpretive and educational programs is to provide memorable educational and recreational experiences, and to foster the development of a personal stewardship ethic. The park’s programs aim to reach this goal by forging connections between park resources, visitors, the community and management. We recognize the enjoyment of the park and its resources is a fundamental part of the visitor experience. That experience is heightened when it progresses from enjoyment to an understanding of the reasons for the park’s existence and the significance of its history.   Interpretive services and facilities are to be developed and operated in accordance with the NPS Organic Act and Strategic Plan, and each park’s enabling legislation, general management plan, strategic plan, resource management plan, and comprehensive interpretive plan (CIP). A park’s CIP will be closely related to its general management plan and. The CIP will include the long-range interpretive plan, the annual interpretive plan, and the interpretive database.
