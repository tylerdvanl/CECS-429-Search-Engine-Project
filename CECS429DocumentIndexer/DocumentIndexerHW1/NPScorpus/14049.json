    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility             Accessibility       Three overlooks within the park are accessible by way of short paved trails from parking lots. The views of the Big South Fork River from above the gorge change throughout the seasons, providing excellent photographic opportunities. East Rim Overlook and Honey Creek Overlook are located in the Tennessee portion of the park and Devils Jump Overlook is in Kentucky. The Blue Heron Overlook, which is located on the same road as Devils Jump Overlook, provides a nice view of the coal tipple at Blue Heron but the paved walk to get there is steep and moderately difficult.  Use the map on your park brochure for driving routes to these panoramic views. If you prefer to watch scenery through a window while leaving the driving to somebody else, consider taking a ride on the Big South Fork Scenic Railway, a national park concessionaire. Board the train from the historic depot in Stearns, Kentucky, and enjoy the landscape as the train rolls by houses, farms and through the forest on its way to and from the Blue Heron Coal Mining Community.",
