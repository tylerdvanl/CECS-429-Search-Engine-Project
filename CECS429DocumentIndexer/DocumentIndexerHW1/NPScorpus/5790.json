Help us make it a pleasant and safe experience.         Where Can I Ride? Bicycling within the national preserve is allowed on the following roads and trails:  Fire Prairie Trail Established roads Designated off-road vehicle trails Nobles Grade (Nobles Grade is the raised road north of Mile Marker 63) Levee 28. You can access Levee 28 from Mile Marker 51, off I-75 and from the S-12A structure off US-41 at the preserve's eastern boundary.       Other Considerations  There are no repair stations within the preserve, so please plan to fix your own flats and other common problems. Big Cypress is remote, and there are few places to refill your water. Our visitor centers are open daily. Make sure you carry sufficient water, as dehydration can happen quickly. Obey all area closures and treat wildlife the same as if you were on foot -- you cannot run faster than a bear, and you cannot cycle faster than a bear. Plan for many types of weather at any time in the park. Sun, heat\/humidity, rain, and high wind are all possible in the summer.",
