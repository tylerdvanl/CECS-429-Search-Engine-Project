Both H.P. Williams and Kirby Storter Roadside Parks provide the opportunity to recharge your batteries and appreciate the beauty of this special place.  Both parks are midway between Miami and Naples along the Tamiami Trail.         H.P. WILLIAMS ROADSIDE PARK This small roadside rest area is named for Homer P. Williams, an engineer, who worked for Barron Collier during the construction of Tamiami Trail in the 1920s. Please click here for more information.               KIRBY STORTER ROADSIDE PARK Approximately halfway through your drive across Big Cypress along Highway 41 is Kirby Storter Roadside Park. Named after one of the area's pioneering families, Kirby Storter worked for several years as a carpenter and electrician for Barron Collier, and later oversaw construction of South Florida roads (including Tamiami Trail) for the Florida Roads Department.
