    "body": "Mazes and Marvels - The Solders' Home       Recognizing the sanitary excellencies, health-giving springs, and splendid scenery in Hot Springs and vicinity, the visitor asks no questions relative to the reasons for locating the Soldiers' Home here. Surroundings speak in no uncertain tone. The visitor scarcely arrives in the city without inquiring, \"What stately building is that yonder on the heights?\" Being informed that it is a tribute to the heroic citizen soldiery of the Republic, a resolve is registered to visit it. Many a soldier dwells there, profoundly thankful for the nation's gratitude. An effort has been made to get a bill through Congress appropriating a quarter of a million dollars to erect a National Hospital for invalid soldiers in connection with the Soldiers' Home. Tests have been made by government officials, proving that Hot Springs is the ideal spot of the states for preserving the nation's defenders. All honor to the nation that is not unmindful of services rendered.",
