Activity Update  A bear obtained food from backpackers twice along the John Muir Trail out of Yosemite Valley (Half Dome Junction and Clouds Rest Junction). Campers at the Snow Creek footbridge reported that a bear rolled their food storage canister away from their campsite. At Happy Isles in Yosemite Valley, a bear obtained food from visitors after they walked away from their food for a short time. Remember—bears are active day and night throughout Yosemite. Protect your property and bears by always storing food in a secured food storage locker or food storage canister when camping. Additionally be vigilant when you are preparing food or hiking and always remain within arm’s reach of any food that is out.   Slow Down! This year, 11 bears have been hit by cars! (37 bears were hit by cars last year.) Six of these bears were killed on impact, including a mother bear that was hit this week, orphaning her three cubs. These cubs were taken to Lake Tahoe Wildlife Care Inc. where they will be cared for until they are old enough to be released back into the park. Please protect wildlife by obeying speed limits and paying attention while driving.  Let us know if you see a bear, no matter where it is or what it's doing. Call 209\/372-0322 or send an email.

Note: A bear incident occurs when a bear causes a monetary loss to a person--that is, if the bear causes property damage or obtains food. Bear incidents also include cases of bears causing injury to a person (which are fairly uncommon).",
