Boney Mountain -Â  Rancho Sierra Vista \/ Satwiwa The area of Rancho Sierra Vista \/ Satwiwa has been inhabited by people for thousands of years. From the Chumash that made this area their home to the ranchers that raised livestock to the many park visitors that come here today; the mountains that rise above have been viewed upon for generations.In May 2013, the park experienced one of its largest wildland fires in nearly 20 years. The Springs Fire burned over 24,000 acres and burned from the U.S. 101 Freeway all the way to the ocean. While the top of the mountain did not burn, the lower hills in the foreground did. Over time, we will be able to watch the recovery and rebirth of this iconic park landscape.    View webcam",
