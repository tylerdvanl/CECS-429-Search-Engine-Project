Bob Bowen Collection       Halfway down Funston Avenue, the Alameda (Spanish for “avenue”) served as the official entrance to the Presidio from the 1860’s until 1895. During this period, cannonballs lined the streets as a form of decorative curbing and soldiers stood guard at the U.S. Army’s preeminent western post. Today, little evidence of the Alameda remains other than the four large Victorian houses that border the old post entrance where Presidio Boulevard meets Funston Avenue.       Two of four large officer's quarters built on the Alameda.        Main Post main page \"Places\" main page",
