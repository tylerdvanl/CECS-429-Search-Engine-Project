    "body": "Swimming       Swimming in park waters is not recommended. At normal stage, the Green River flows at a relatively brisk 4.3 knots, or about 5 miles per hour - too strong to swim against. The flow of the Nolin River is only slightly slower. In addition, the usually opaque water may conceal deep holes or submerged snags or other hazards. Green River can be deceptively deep in places, well in excess of 10'. There is no designated swimming area in the park, and no lifeguards are on duty. If you do swim, observe weather conditions. Flooding is possible. In case of storms, leave the water and seek shelter. Swimming, wading, or bathing is prohibited within 200 feet of the Green River Ferry landings and the Houchin Ferry landings. These areas are used for the operations of the ferries, as well as the launching and extracting of small watercraft. The safety of swimmers and bathers would be at risk in these areas. In addition, swimmers and bathers in these areas would interfere with efficient ferry operations.",
