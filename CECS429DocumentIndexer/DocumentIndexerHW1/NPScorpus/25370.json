    "body": "Trip Planning Packet      Traveling in a remote wilderness park requires visitors to be self sufficient and flexible.    You need to arrive at your jumping off point with everything you need for a safe and comfortable trip.    Bush travel requires flexibility.  There are many reasons for delays going in and out of the park.  You should take enough food to remain in the park several extra days.  It is also a good idea to have a back up route plan with maps just in case.    Before you leave for your trip, contact the Park and Preserve for updates and advisories.  Visitors in the park must practice minimum impact techniques, adhere to Leave No Trace principles, follow backcountry safety guidelines, and be aware of the fragile ecosystems and private lands within the park.   Before you go into the backcountry, stop by the Bettles Ranger Station, Coldfoot Arctic Interagency Visitor Center, Marion Creek Ranger Station (near Coldfoot), or Anaktuvuk Pass Ranger Station for a backcountry orientation.   We request that you fill out the voluntary Back Country Registration Form.  You will also have the opportunity to check out Bear Resistant Food Containers (BRFCs) at these locations. BRFCs are the easiest way to meet the mandatory food storage regulations for all overnight visitors in the Park.  Also visit our Backpacking & Hiking and Wild & Scenic Rivers pages to plan your trip      Lots of information for your visit, all packed into easily downloadable and printable PDF files! Please feel free to phone (907-692-5494) or email us if you have any questions that are not answered by this material.
