    "body": "Climate Change                The Furnace Creek Visitor Center in Death Valley National Park was granted the Award of Excellence from Docomomo US.   Death Valley National Park and its partners are creating new strategies in response to an uncertain future in the face of a changing climate. From developing Action Plans that plot a course towards a “greener” National Park System, to building a LEED certified visitor center, Death Valley National Park is incorporating climate friendly behavior into its park operations, facility management, and communications. No one quite knows what the future will hold for Death Valley’s climate. As temperatures rise, precipitation patterns may change. Plants and animals in the park may be pushed to find new homes or succumb to these threats and become extinct.",
