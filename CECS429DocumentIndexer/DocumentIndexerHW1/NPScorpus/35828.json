Washington), the news was received quickly.  Booker T. Washington remembered the great day of emancipation in his autobiography, Up From Slavery. Everyone held in the bonds of slavery did not share the same sweet story.  In some areas of the country the news did not spread very quickly.  For these areas, it took months.  On June 19, 1865, General Gordon Granger arrived in Texas to issue General Order 3.  This order did what the Emancipation Proclamation intended to do in January of 1863.  All enslaved Africans were freed.  Celebrations erupted in Texas!  This is the celebration of Juneteenth.

This segment is the interpretation of what the enslaved folk felt in the winter of 1863. The enslaved residents on the farm are concerned about the increased quota system placed on Confederate families to donate more grain and food for the army and destitute families of Confederates killed or wounded in battle. This means less food for them. Many enslaved fathers, brothers and sons are being hired out and pressed into service in dangerous occupations working for the confederacy. The women are anxious about getting passes to see their husbands during the “Big Times” this year.

It is the winter of 1863 and has been the worst so far during “the War” for the Burroughs family. They have lost Billy Burroughs who was killed at the Battle of Kelly’s Ford in Culpeper, Virginia in March. In July, Ben Burroughs was wounded, captured and hospitalized. Christopher Frank Burroughs has been captured and sent to a prison in Maryland. Various discussions about Christmas and the war are going on amongst residents and visitors in the slave quarters and the big house. Talk revolves around food shortages, family members and friends who may not return home for Christmas, the “Big Times,” and hopes for the future.   Duration:10 minutes, 8 seconds",
