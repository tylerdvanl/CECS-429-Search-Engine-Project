    "body": "Explore This Park    Get Involved     Support Your Park             Support Your Park       Donations You can make a gift either directly to the National Park Service or to our nonprofit, tax exempt support organization, Los Compadres, to benefit the San Antonio Missions. If you donate to the park, your entire gift will be used for the purpose you and the park agree upon. No administrative cost is deducted from your gift to the National Park Service. Your check will be deposited in a government account and the full amount will be spent as you intended. The advantage of making your gift check out to Los Compadres, our park Friends Group, is that the amount will be deposited in an interest bearing account to assist park-prioritized requested projects or programs.  Visitors to the park can give direct cash or check gifts through our donation boxes. Unlike entrance fees, 100% of donated funds stay in this park. A donation box is located in the Visitor Center at Mission San Jos√© and at each mission contact station. You may also mail donations to 2202 Roosevelt Ave. San Antonio, TX 78210.  Historic objects, manuscripts, books and other related items that have a direct relationship with San Antonio Missions may be donated to the park's museum collection, where they are preserved for future generations to enjoy and learn. Contact Curator at (201) 534-8833 to discuss anything you are considering donating to the park's collection.",
