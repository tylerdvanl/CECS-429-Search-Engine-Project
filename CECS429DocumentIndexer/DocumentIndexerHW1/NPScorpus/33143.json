Those applying to merit promotion announcements must have permanent federal employment status as a career or career-conditional employee, reinstatement eligibility based on former permanent status, or be eligible for special appointing authorities as specified in the vacancy announcement.

If applicants can be considered from other sources, this will be clearly indicated on the vacancy announcement. The park issues public job announcements through the USAJOBS web site, maintained by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). OPM has delegated authority to Mount Rainier to conduct recruitment for some vacant positions. All qualified applicants from outside the federal service will be considered for these vacancies.   Term Employment - A term job is an appointment to a position that will last more than one year but not more than four years and that is of a project nature where the job will terminate upon completion of the project. Temporary Employment - At Mount Rainier, the summer season extends from late May through the end of September. Most temporary positions correspond to this season, although a limited number of openings may occur at other times of the year. Temporary jobs are usually announced and applications accepted from late October to late February each year. Announcements are open for periods ranging from five days to two weeks.
