NPS\/Kurt Moses          \"Explore, Learn, Protect!\" The Junior Ranger motto is recited by children around the country—each taking an oath of their own to protect parks, continue to learn about parks, and share their own ranger story with friends and family. Like many other national parks, Joshua Tree offers young visitors the opportunity to join the National Park Service \"family\" as Junior Rangers. Interested youth complete a series of activities during a park visit, share their answers with a park ranger, and receive an official Junior Ranger badge. Junior Rangers are typically between the ages of 5 to 13, although people of all ages can participate. Kids visiting Joshua Tree National Park may earn a Junior Ranger badge by completing a number of activities as they explore the park. The Junior Ranger booklet is available at park entrance stations and visitor centers. Booklet activities include drawing, writing, attending a ranger program, and picking up trash in the park. Want to preview the program before your visit? Download the Joshua Tree National Park Junior Ranger booklet (4 MB PDF). Joshua Tree also participates in national Junior Ranger programs like Junior Paleontologist, Junior Ranger Night Explorer, and Wilderness Explorer.  Can't make it to a park?
