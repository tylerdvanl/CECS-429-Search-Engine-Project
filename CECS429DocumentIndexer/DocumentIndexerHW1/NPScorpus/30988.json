This enabling legislation stipulated that the original grantors of the property retain all rights to minerals within what became the National Seashore. Therefore, the mineral estate underlying the park is either owned privately or by the State of Texas. The National Park Service is legally required to allow access to the minerals while applying stringent requirements and ensuring adherence to federal and state regulations, policies, and guidelines.

There are also local options that negate the need to distance cast at Bob Hall Pier at Padre Balli Park, Packery Channel (North and South Jetties), and many places along the Laguna Madre.
