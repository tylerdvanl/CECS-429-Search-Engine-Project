Native plant and animal species have suffered predation from the turtles and are often outcompeted for resources by the red-eared slider. The turtles are primarily introduced to the Santa Monica Mountains because of pet-releases into the wild. The red-eared slider quickly colonizes new freshwater wetland habitats, especially streams, canals and irrigation ditches.         What you can do! The Santa Monica Mountains is no place for your pet! Please refrain from releasing your pet turtle into the wild. Finding a new home for your pet in a school or neighborsâ€™ house is much better option!",
