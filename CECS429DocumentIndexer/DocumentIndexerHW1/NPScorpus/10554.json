    "body": "Harbor Connections       Harbor Connections provides curriculum development for teachers and hands-on, experiential learning for students in public schools in Boston and the surrounding area. The majority of students receive at least two classroom visits, one or two on-island expeditions, and one to two guest speakers. Through Harbor Connections, teachers incorporate the Boston Harbor Islands into their science, math, and physics lessons plans. We also work with teachers to be sure the lesson plans are aligned with the state and city education requirements. Harbor Connections was created by Capt. David Weinstein in 1997. The next year it was expanded to include the Boston Harbor Islands. It has continued to grow each year, with sponsorship by National Park Service, Island Alliance, and Thompson Island Outward Bound Education Center. For more information, contact Hugh Hawthorne, Youth and Visitor Services Program Manager at Boston Harbor Islands.",
