The river proved to be an ideal habitat for anadromous (sea-run) fish, with eleven varieties of salmon and trout spawning in its waters. For millennia these fish thrived in the river and provided food for the Lower Elwha Klallam tribe who resided along its banks.             In the late 1800s a growing nation looked to the Northwest to supply the lumber needed to build new cities.This brought rapid change to the Olympic Peninsula and especially to the Elwha River and the people of the Lower Elwha Klallam tribe. In the early 1900s, two dams, Elwha and Glines Canyon, were built on the river. The dams fueled regional growth, but blocked the migration of salmon upstream, disrupted the flow of sediment and wood downstream, and flooded the historic homelands and cultural sites of the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe.   For over a century, the web of ecological and cultural connections in the Elwha Valley were broken - then the river's story changed course. In 1992, Congress passed the Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act, authorizing dam removal to restore the altered ecosystem. After two decades of planning, the largest dam removal in U.S. history began on September 17, 2011. Six months later Elwha Dam was gone, followed by the Glines Canyon Dam in 2014. Today, the Elwha River once again flows freely from its headwaters in the Olympic Mountains to the Strait of Juan de Fuca.         Discover Elwha River Restoration         History of the Elwha and Dam Removal Discovery the history of the Elwha Valley from the glacial retreat to present day or read about the dam removal process on the Elwha River Restoration Blog.           Restoration of the Elwha River Webisode Series View a series of webisodes that chronicle the removal of the Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams. The webisodes begin with the history of the dams and continue through the dam deconstruction and ecosystem restoration process.         Current Research  The Elwha River Restoration project provides a rare opportunity for scientists to learn what happens when a dam is removed and salmon return to a wild, protected river. Learn more about Elwha River Restoration research and monitoring or read a research publication.         Giving Mother Nature a Hand A major restoration project is underway in the old lake beds. Park botanists and dedicated volunteers have begun the labor intensive task of reestablishing riparian areas by planting more than 400,000 native plants in the newly exposed sediment. Learn more on the Elwha revegetation page.         Elwha Fisheries Today Elwha River salmonids have renewed access to more than 70 river miles of pristine spawning habitat protected within the park. Learn more about anadromous fish in the Elwha, restoration approaches for each individual species, or read the full Elwha River Fish Restoration Plan.           John Gussman (c)  Where the Mountains Feed the Sea The nearshore environment, where the Elwha River meets the sea is changing in leaps and bounds. With renewed sediment flow, sandy beaches are reappearing and nearshore habitat that once provided rich shellfish beds is reemerging. Learn more on the USGS Elwha Nearshore page.        A River Gone Wild The Elwha River is transitioning from its dam-bound era to a river wild and free. The river was severely altered by 100 years of dams. Biologists say it could take a generation or more to heal. It is rare to get to watch a river reborn. Scientists are watching, measuring, monitoring and evaluating the changes in an effort to understand the river evolution processes. What we learn from the Elwha River Restoration Project will help inform future dam removal and restoration projects.       Meet the Olympic National Park partners that helped free the Elwha River.
