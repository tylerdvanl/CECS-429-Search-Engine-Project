    "body": "Donate       There are many ways to donate to your favorite park. Regardless of what form it takes, your donation is greatly appreciated!  You can make a gift to benefit our park directly to the National Park Service. The entire gift will be used for the purposes that you and the park agree upon. No administrative costs are deducted from your gift if it is made directly to the National Park Service. Your check will be deposited in a government account and the full amount will be spent as you intended. Most parks have separate donation accounts for park-specific projects and programs for which you can earmark your gift. Government accounts are non-interest bearing and cannot generate interest between the time it is deposited and the time it is spent.    Historic objects, manuscripts, photos, books and other related items that have a direct relationship to Congaree National Park may be donated to the park's museum collection, where they are preserved for future generations to enjoy and access for research purposes. Contact the Park Museum Coordinator, Theresa Yednock, to discuss items that you are considering donating to the park's collection.",
