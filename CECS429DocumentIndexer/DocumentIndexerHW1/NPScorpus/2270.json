The boundaries of the Navajo (Din'e) homeland are four sacred mountains: Blanca Peak, Mount Taylor, the San Francisco Peaks, and the La Plata Mountains. The Din'e moved into this area around 1800, and changed from hunting and gathering when the Spanish introduced domesticated animals.  Sheepherding became central to their lives.  The Din'e have a long tradition of using the area around Navajo National Monument for both sacred and economic purposes.  Â      Navajo Rugs on Display NACE  Navajo artists are famous for their weaving skills. Each summer, a weaver works in the visitor center, demonstrating her craft. She is joined by a painter, a sash weaver, and a basket maker. Come and see.",
