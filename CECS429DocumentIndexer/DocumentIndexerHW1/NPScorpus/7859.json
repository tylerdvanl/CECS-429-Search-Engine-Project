Algonquians, Europeans, and African Americans have all played their parts here. First here were the Carolina Algonquians, who farmed the land and fished the sounds. In 1584, English explorers sponsored by Sir Walter Raleigh arrived here. It was the first of three voyages in England's attempt to colonize North America. During the American Civil War, the US Army established a freedmen's colony here. The colony prepared formerly enslaved people for life after the war. Today, The Lost Colony dramatically interprets the 1580s interactions between the Algonquian and English. Welcome to Fort Raleigh National Historic Site, where the stories connected with these and other events are preserved and commemorated.",
