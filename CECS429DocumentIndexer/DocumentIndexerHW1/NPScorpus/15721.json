Nearly half of these are annual plants, like many of the wildflowers that bloom in spring. The park also has a spectacular number of trees and shrubs. Shrub assemblages here are among the most diverse vegetation types in North America. Joshua Tree is also known for its numerous species of cacti and rare plants. The park is home to many species of ferns, mosses, and liverworts—also known as bryophytes.  Many species of lichens can easily be found growing on the famous rock formations of the park. The diversity of the plant life found in Joshua Tree National Park provides ample opportunities for study and enjoyment. The park's herbarium documents nearly all of the plants found here. The herbarium's records are available to search online. With a spectacular diversity of plants and plant communities, it's no wonder the name proposed for this area in 1930 was Desert Plants National Park!                   Joshua Tree Lichens   20 Photos  Lichen species found in Joshua Tree National Park",
