    "body": "Special Use Permits       Individuals or organizations interested in applying for a special use permit may first call the park at 516-922-4271 ext. 26 for questions about Special Use Permits. If an applicant wishes to proceed, they must fill out the Application for a Special Use Permit, and send to the park to the attention of the Special Use Permit Coordinator. Unless requested use is an exercise of a First Amendment right, applications must be accompanied by a non-refundable, $50 check made out to \"The National Park Service.\" Please remember that the Park is a museum and historic site and is not designed for private parties, receptions, or recreational purposes unrelated to the park's mission. A large, indoor meeting space is not available at the park. We do have a small meeting area which is not universally accessible, but does requires a Special Use Permit as well.  For commercial photography, both still and film, an application must be submitted in advance. You may use either the short (10-931) or long (10-932) form depending on the complexity of the project. Unless requested use is an exercise of a First Amendment right, applications must be submitted with a non-refundable, $50 check made out to \"The National Park Service.\" Permit may require the payment of cost recovery charges, a location fee, and proof of liability insurance naming the United States as also insured.",
