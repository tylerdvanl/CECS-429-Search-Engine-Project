In 2004, to address these needs, Congress signed the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA) which allows the U.S. Department of the Interior to implement an interagency Fee Program in three of its agencies-the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The program also includes the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service. The program directs funds collected from park visitors towards the maintenance of the facilities they are utilizing. These funds have been and will continue to be used for maintenance, repair projects, public service programs, signage, and natural and historical resource preservation.The remaining revenue is generally distributed to parks that do not collect fees but have similar needs and to fund other servicewide initiatives.
