Even if you cannot visit the park in person, you can check out some of the newly installed exhibitry...       Rainbow Forest Museum: Blue Mesa Room This exhibit represents a slice of time in Petrified Forest's long history. A mural of a Triassic river ecosystem sets the stage. The surrounding panels and displays explain how scientists and artists know what the land was like over 200 million years ago. Information on fossils, river ecology, plate tectonics, climatology, and stratigraphy all contribute to the painting of that mural. There is even a simulated fossil dig pit, popular among young and old alike.       The Blue Mesa room at Rainbow Forest Museum NPS\/Stephanie Metzler       Painted Desert Inn Tap Room Gallery First it was the Painted Desert Inn's lobby.

The signs needed some maintenance, as well as an update of information. In a park with so much active research, we want to share the latest discoveries with visitors. Over 50 waysides are located along the roads and trails throughout the park explaining the landscape and covering a variety of topics specific to their locations.       New waysides in place (L-R): Chinde Point, The Tepees, Route 66 alignment NPS       Painted Desert Viewpoints Sometimes the park overlooks seem like exhibits in themselves. Certain roadside pullouts also feature an informative sign. Kachina Point is a great place to overlook the reds and oranges of the Painted Desert. More information...",
