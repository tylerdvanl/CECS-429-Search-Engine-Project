NPS photo by Dave BoyleThe spirit of Kaloko-Honokohau was its life, the life that flowed in its land and the water that washed upon its shore.  Like Hawaiians who found its presence elsewhere, the people of Kaloko-Honokohau let the spirit become part of their existence. They lived in such perfect harmony with it that they became a singular, total, and inseparable environment.   From \"The spirit of Kaloko-Honokohau\"-1974Drawing by Herb Kawainui KaneKaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park offers you the chance to enjoy and learn about the Hawaiian culture and the natural history of Hawai'i.
