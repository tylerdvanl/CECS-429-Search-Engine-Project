    "body": "Convento       The Spanish word convento does not mean \"convent,\" but rather describes a group of buildings or rooms built around a square and connected to a mission church. These rooms generally included a residence for the missionary, a kitchen, workshops such as a leather shop, blacksmith shop, etc., classrooms, and sometimes dormitory rooms for young, unmarried people. All that remains above ground of Tumacácori's convento is a portion of the missionary's quarters. Even that, however, requires continuous work to maintain and preserve what is left.       NPS Photo by David Yubeta",
