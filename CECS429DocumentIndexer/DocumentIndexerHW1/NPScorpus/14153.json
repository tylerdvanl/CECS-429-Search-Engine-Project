Jesus Treviño, founder of San Ygnacio, built this 100- by 140-foot sandstone home in 1830, safeguarding family and neighbors during frequent Indian raids. The house became known as Fort Treviño. Later son-in-law Blas Maria Uribe built the loop holed fort, and in 1851 he had a native stone made into a polished sundial that was set into the north wall of the fort. San Ygnacio became a center of trade by the mid-1800s, and the town was the scene of several border skirmishes throughout the years.  Jesús Treviño Fort and Ranch is a national historic landmark. Uribe’s timepiece has become a tourist attraction. Time period: 1830s Ownership: Private A Photographic Journey of the Trail - NEXT IMAGE  PREVIOUS IMAGE",
