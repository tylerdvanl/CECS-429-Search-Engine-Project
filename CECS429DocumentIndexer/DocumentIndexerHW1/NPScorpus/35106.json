Use a map instead.      Car  You will have to visit each district of the park separately; no bridges or roads connect the districts within the park.  From US 191 north of Moab, UT 313 leads to Island in the Sky. From US 191 south of Moab, UT 211 leads to The Needles. Only unpaved roads access The Maze (graded dirt or high-clearance, four-wheel-drive). These roads may become impassable when wet.   Check park road conditions. Plane Major commercial airlines serve Grand Junction, Colorado, and Salt Lake City, Utah.  By car, these cities are at least 2 and 4 hours (respectively) away from the closest park entrance (Island in the Sky). Smaller planes serve Moab, Utah, about 40 minutes from Island in the Sky. Bus Greyhound travels along Interstate 70, making stops at Grand Junction, Colorado, and Green River, Utah. Commercial vans\/shuttles operate between Moab and Salt Lake City as well as Grand Junction. Train Amtrak stops at Grand Junction, Colorado, and Green River, Utah. Commercial van services operate between Grand Junction and Moab. Public Transportation There is no public transportation to Canyonlands. Getting Around Travel to Canyonlands generally requires a car. Once in the park, each district offers different opportunities for exploration. The Island in the Sky is the most accessible district and the easiest to visit in a short period of time. All other destinations require some boating, hiking or four-wheel driving to see the area's attractions. Alternative Fuel Vehicles Do you plan to travel to the park in an alternative fuel vehicle?
