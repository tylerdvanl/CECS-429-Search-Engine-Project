In addition, regulations allow school groups and other bona fide national academic institutions to obtain a waiver for park entrance fees, provided that the visit is for educational or scientific purposes, and the resources or facilities the group proposes to use support those purposes. Fee waivers must be approved in advance of the visit and cannot be issued when a group arrives on-site. Groups without a pre-approved fee waiver will pay entrance fees. If you meet the criteria, please complete and submit the Application for Advance Reservation and Educational Fee Waiver to the address at the top of the application form. Please allow 14 days for processing. The park will contact you once the application is processed. If your request is approved, you will receive an academic fee waiver. The park will then contact you to arrange a time and date and issue instructions for your visit. The group leader must present a copy of the approved fee waiver at the park visitor center. If your request is denied, you will receive a letter from the park explaining why your group does not qualify. If the request is denied because the required material is not submitted, the park will attempt to contact and assist you. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Jeff Wade at 816-254-2720 or jeff_wade@nps.gov.",
