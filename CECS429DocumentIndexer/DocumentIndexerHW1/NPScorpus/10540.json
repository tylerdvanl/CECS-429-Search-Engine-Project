    "body": "Boston Harbor Islands Partnership: Committees       There are six standing committees of the Boston Harbor Islands Partnership, with some active subcommittees.  The standing committees are: Planning, Operations, Marketing, Education, Finance, and Nominating.  Membership on committees is open to Partners, Voting Alternates, members of the Advisory Council, and other cooperators' representatives. Each committee selects its own chairperson to be approved by the Partnership. The chairperson must be a Voting Partnership member or a Voting Alternate. Committee chairs or Partnership members may invite non-members of the Partnership or Advisory Council to participate in committee assignments as their specific expertise is needed. The standing committees meet on an \"as needed\" basis, usually in Boston. Meetings may be held at any time when called by the chairperson of the committee. A written or telephone notice of the time, place and purposes of the meeting shall be given at least five days before the meeting. All meetings are open to the public, check the meetings calendar for specifics.  Special committees may be appointed by the Chairperson of the Partnership for any purpose that does not conflict with the authority and jurisdiction of any standing committee.",
