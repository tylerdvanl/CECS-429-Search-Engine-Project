Why: One of the greatest challenges to starting your career will be finding your first seasonal job. Competition is fierce and hiring officials have the overwhelming task of choosing from a large applicant pool in a very short amount of time. Only applicants who have taken it upon themselves to attain additional experience stand out above the rest. This is where the Grand Canyon V-Unit program can benefit you.  While working alongside future peers and employers, you will gain the experiences you need to become competitive, the references needed to vouch for your capabilities, and the confidence to become a competent U.S. Park Ranger. Supervisors will help identify your career development needs and work with you to facilitate training and exposure.   But what if I'm hired by another park while volunteering for Grand Canyon?    Great! No hard feelings. While this program is designed to assist the Visitor and Resource Protection Division at Grand Canyon, our ultimate goal is to benefit the National Park Service by preparing its next generation of future Rangers.  Pay: Although this is a volunteer program, V-Units will be urged to sign up for after-hours emergency responses and will be paid as emergency hire employees when needed.
