    "body": "For Kids       In the Park Theodore Roosevelt National Park offers a number of activities for kids and families. The Junior Ranger Program for the park is a family favorite! Kids complete a field journal and several activities to earn an official Junior Ranger badge! Ask at a visitor center for a copy of the field journal. National parks around the country have Junior Ranger programs, and kids can earn and collect badges from hundreds of national park sites. Many of our guided ranger programs are designed for families. Generally programs are offered throughout the summer months. Look out for special programs for Junior Rangers on the summer weekends! Parents can check out a Family Fun Pack at the Visitor Center in either the South or North Unit. The pack includes binoculars, guide books, activity sheets and more. At Home or In the Car Visit our Park Fun page for some printable activities to do at home or in the car. You can build a model of the Maltese Cross Cabin, play bingo, or do a word search! Families or kids who are interested in learning about the park from home should check out the Kids & Youth section of our website!",
