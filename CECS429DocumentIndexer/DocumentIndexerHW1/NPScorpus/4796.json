Mammals include large animals like the javelina, coyote, Mexican Wolf, bighorn sheep, and bobcat. Smaller animals like the fox, skunk, cottontail, and jackrabbit also live here. Another mammal that lives in the desert is the bat. These animals pollinate many plants and eat lots of bugs. There are two bats unique to the Sonoran desert: the long-tongued bat and the long-nosed bat .        A Round-tailed ground squirrel at Casa Grande Ruins.
