    "body": "Explore This Park    Get Involved     Volunteer            Volunteer       Every year volunteers donate hundreds of hours to the Seashore through popular programs including our MLK service weekend, our Natural Resource Intern Program, and our Alternative Spring Break program. We could not continue these programs without the support of long term park partners such as  the Student Conservation Association and The Georgia Conservancy. The Student Conservation Association (SCA) and Cumberland Island work together to bring college age students to the Seashore for 12-16 week field based internships. In addition we also have opportunities for High School students to participate in cultural landscape restoration projects each summer. Each January, the Georgia Conservancy along with several other partners work to bring a diverse volunteer work force to Cumberland. This highly popular service weekend strives to educate new volunteers to the wonder that is Cumberland while capitalizing on the knowledge of our returning volunteers. We also work with the Atlanta area Historic Black Colleges and Universities to sponsor a backpacking\/service unit with this weekend. Learn more by going to the Georgia Conservancy's website. Alternative Spring Break. From March to May each year the Seashore is popular with those seeking warmth and a bit of hard work. Each week during this time frame we accept work parties from up to three college and universities to spend their spring break giving back to the Park. If you are interested in how your school may participate in this program, please contact us at the information listed below.
