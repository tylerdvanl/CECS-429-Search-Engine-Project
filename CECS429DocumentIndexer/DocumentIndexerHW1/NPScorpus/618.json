This is an important cultural site and the park strives to maintain the cultural landscape. Please respect this site that is important and significant to the Hawaiian people. A snorkelling area locally known as \"two step\" lies adjacent to the park, and is managed by the Hawaii Department of Natural Resources. The access road to the snorkelling area is the one way public road with a public coastal access sign just before entereing the park.  If already parked inside the park, one may easily walk out of the park past the entrance kiosk and turn left on the second road with the aforementioned street signages. Snorkellers, swimmers, and sunbathers are asked NOT to use the restrooms at the park.",
