In the distance is Pennsylvania's Pocono Plateau. NPS Photo  Hikers on the Appalachian Trail along the ridge of the Kittatinny Mountains on the park's New Jersey side and the Cliff Trail on the Pennsylvania side can discover some of the best views in the park. In the late summer and early fall with the leaves turning colors and large birds of prey migrating south through the valley, a marvelous view-scape of nature awaits those who climb these rocky trails.

The air during these periods is typically crystal clear.      Articles on Environmental Factors",
