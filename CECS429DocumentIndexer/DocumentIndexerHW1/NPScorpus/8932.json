Since 1985, researchers have found 195 species which is believed to be over 90% of the lichens present.  This amount of lichen flora is good for an area comprised of mostly hardwood forests and dry sand dunes.  The bogs and wetland areas were host to several of the northern lichens.  Trees along the forest edge, around the farmsteads, and in the abandoned orchards produced many lichens.  The woodlands on stabilized dunes near the Lake Michigan shoreline produced many lichens on both the trees and on the ground as the various lichen species took advantage of the moist, marine environment.  Interest in studying lichens as an indicator of air quality and atmospheric pollutants may lead to future research studies within the Lakeshore.",
