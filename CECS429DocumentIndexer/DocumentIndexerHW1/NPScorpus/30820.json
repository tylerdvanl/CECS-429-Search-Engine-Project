It is federally owned and managed by the National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior. The reconstructed fort was built on the footprint of the original Fort Stanwix. The site was established as a national monument in 1935, but fort reconstruction did not commence until 1974 when an archeological study by NPS was completed. The reconstructed fort was opened to the public in 1976, exhibiting a portion of the extensive archeological collections found on-site. The National Monument site occupies approximately 16 acres and is bordered by main thoroughfares surrounded by a mixture of commercial, residential, light industrial, and institutional land uses, none of which were present during the fort's period of occupation. The site of the fort, but not the reconstructed structure, is listed in the National Register of Historic Places and is a National Historic Landmark, significant for the events that transpired there during the American Revolution.  The reconstructed fort consists of an earth and timber-clad, reinforced concrete structure that surrounds three freestanding buildings. Located within the reconstructed fort, there is an original feature -- the foundation of a brick hearth. A detailed description of the fort features can be found in the Affected Environment section (Part Three) of this document. Several structures which were proposed in the 1967 master plan have not been reconstructed, including the Ravelin, Sally Port, Headquarters, and Guardhouse.  There are a number of sites located within a day's drive of the fort that are related to the siege of Fort Stanwix. They include Saratoga National Historical Park in Stillwater, NY, and Oriskany Battlefield State Historic Site in nearby Whitestown.  The reconstructed fort is closed to the public during the winter months, but the Marinus Willett Collections Management and Education Center (2005) is open year-round, 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., except for January 1, Thanksgiving Day (U.S.), and December 25. Admission to the Marinus Willett Center and Fort are free. Visitors are encouraged to start their experience at the Marinus Willett Center at the intersection of West Dominick and James Streets. A park ranger can assist you in planning your visit. For more information about upcoming events call the park at 315-338-7730.

Fort Stanwix National Monument is significant because it commemorates the broader contest of nations for economic and political control of the rich resources within the Mohawk Valley region of New York State and the Northern Frontier during the 18th and early 19th centuries.   top of page       Enabling Park Legislation After the 150th anniversary of the siege was celebrated in 1927, interest in the fort and the historic events in which it had figured was renewed.
