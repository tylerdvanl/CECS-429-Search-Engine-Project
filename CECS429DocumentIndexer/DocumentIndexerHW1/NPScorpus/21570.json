    "body": "Leave No Trace       What is Leave No Trace? Leave No Trace (LNT) is about attitude and ethics. It’s about taking personal responsibility to respect and care for our limited wildland resources and the experiences of other outdoor enthusiasts. Low-impact skills and knowledge are also an important part of LNT, but without the right attitude and ethic, they are useless. You must commit yourself to apply them, to practice good stewardship. Leave No Trace extends the National Park Service mission to you and challenges you to “…conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.” Leave them unimpaired = Leave No Trace",
