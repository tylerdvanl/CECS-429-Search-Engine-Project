    "body": "Explore This Park    Learn About the Park     History & Culture             History & Culture       Buck Island Reef National Monument was established by Presidential proclamation in 1961, and expanded in 2001, in order to preserve \"one of the finest marine gardens in the Caribbean Sea.\" The park is now one of only a few fully marine protected areas in the National Park System. The 176-acre island and surrounding coral reef ecosystem support a large variety of native flora and fauna, including several endangered and threatened species such as hawksbill turtles and brown pelicans. The elkhorn coral barrier reef that surrounds two-thirds of the island has extraordinary coral formations, deep grottoes, abundant reef fishes, sea fans and gorgonians.  Although mainly known for its coral reef and nesting sites for turtles and birds, Buck Island has a rich cultural history as well.",
