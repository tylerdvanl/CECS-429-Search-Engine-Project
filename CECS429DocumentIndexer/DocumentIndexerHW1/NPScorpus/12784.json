The road to the area is open from late spring through fall. Mineral King is connected to the rest of Sequoia National Park only by trail. RVs and trailers are not recommended on Mineral King Road and are not permitted in campgrounds here. Both campgrounds are for tent camping only and are first-come, first served. Both campgrounds have vault toilets. Supplies, showers, and food are available at nearby Silver City Resort (on private land). In 2016, both will be open from May 25 through October 26. No water will be available at either campground after October 14. Atwell Mill Campground Located amidst a once-logged giant sequoia grove, this remote campground with 21 sites is open to tent camping during the summer season. RVs and trailers are not permitted. The campground is one hour from the town of Three Rivers, one and a half hours from the the main entrance to Sequoia National Park, and two and a half hours to Giant Forest Museum.  Cold Springs Campground Situated along the east fork of the Kaweah River, this remote campground with 40 sites is open to tent camping during the summer season. RVs and trailers are not permitted. The campground is located one hour from the town of Three Rivers, one and a half hours from the the main entrance to Sequoia National Park, and two and a half hours to Giant Forest Museum.",
