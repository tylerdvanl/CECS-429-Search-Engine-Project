Due to this requirement, it can be difficult to impossible to buy gasoline in the evening or at night in the communities surrounding the monument. Fill up with gasoline before leaving major roads or communities if you will be traveling late. The fuel station in Mitchell is for cardlock holders only. For all practical purposes, for most visitors, there is no fuel available on Highway 26 between Prineville and Dayville at any time of day. It is inadvisable to travel this stretch of road with under half a tank of fuel.
