NPS Photo\/Adrienne Lindholm   Great Kobuk Sand Dunes The Great Kobuk Sand Dunes are a popular destination for hiking and camping. Aircraft on wheels can land right on the sand. Tents can be set up on any level surface and day hiking in any direction is feasible. An alternative is to land on the Kobuk River in a float plane and backpack two miles across the tundra up to the dunes. Getting there is an orienteering exercise that takes about 4 hours round trip from the river to the dunes. Contact the park visitor cent in Kotzebue for more specific route information at 907.442.3890. There is no marked route, so good orienteering skills are required. See the video on trip logistics to the dunes to help plan an excursion.    Depending on the time of year visitors are planning on traveling to the dunes, they could have some amazing experiences with the natural world. From hiking on the dunes in the summer and experiencing 100 degree Fahrenheit weather to observing the caribou migration in the fall, the sand dunes are truly a special place.",
