By combining in-class and hands-on photography experiences in the park, we will learn about compositional principles that will enable us to make more compelling photographs of wildflowers, geologic features, and grand mountain views. The workshop will consist of a two-hour in class presentation on the principles of lighting and composition, a five-hour hands-on field excursion, a one-hour optional session, and a post photo-shoot critique session. Session includes:   The camera, a tool for the heart and mind. Basic aperture, depth of field, etc.  Learning to see like an artist: documentation and interpretation. Basic principles of composition: visual weight, proportion, perspective, etc.  Seeing the light: quality and direction of light, color. From concept to portfolio: telling a story.
