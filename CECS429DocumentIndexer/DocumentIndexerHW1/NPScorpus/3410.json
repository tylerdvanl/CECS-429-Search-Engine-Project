Here's some ideas for young people:  Explore Fort Caroline & the Preserve Visitor Center and compare life in a Timucua village with life in a French fort. Take a hike or bike ride at the Theodore Roosevelt Area - keep a lookout for birds and animals! Learn about the daily life of the enslaved children who worked at Kingsley Plantation - we think you'll find it is a lot different than your life today. Match up the animal calls with the animal pictures in the exhibits at the Ribault Club. You can also learn to speak Timucuan!  While you're discovering new activities at the park, you can become a Junior Ranger! There's four program options which let you earn four different badges. We've got special brochures and activity pages for kids too!
