Some of the wonderful things to observe along the way include the mountains, trees, wildflowers, the graceful curves... and the speed limit, which is strictly enforced for your safety.  Law enforcement rangers investigate on average 200 accidents each year with half of those resulting in serious injury.          Considering its unique design, the Parkway drive is different than most and this can mean taking extra care to ensure a safe visit. \"Enjoy the view, but watch the road!\" is our way of reminding visitors to pay extra attention along the Parkway. A few specific pointers and facts may help even more.      STEEP GRADES In some places, the Parkway has steeper grades than normally found on highways. Without paying close attention, your speed can increase far more than you expect.       UNFORGIVING ROAD SHOULDERS The Parkway's road shoulders are narrow in places so that the meadows or forest edges grow close to the pavement. This is part of the beauty of the drive, but may require some extra attention.       BUILT-IN DISTRACTIONS Wildlife, wildflowers, bicyclists, and extraordinary views… all of these contribute to the Parkway experience and every traveler should be aware of these while enjoying the drive. Take advantage of the more than 250 overlooks to safely enjoy the views.       LIMITED SIGHT DISTANCES Just as there aren't many straight lines in the natural world, the Parkway was designed with gentle curves and not many straight sections. This is part of what makes the road seem to lie gently on the land and it also requires some extra care while driving.      SPEED LIMIT CHANGES The Parkway speed limit is mostly 45 mph, but occasionally it will drop to 25 mph or 35 mph.      DECREASING RADIUS CURVES Some of the tight curves on this mountain road do not have a consistent radius so that extra care needs to be taken, especially on motorcycles.      DRIVING LARGE RECREATIONAL VEHICLES Large RVs are popular means of travel on the Parkway, but be advised that going up or down steep grades can be slow. Pull over often to let faster moving traffic get by. You may want to check the heights of the Parkway's twenty-six tunnels (mostly south of Asheville) to ensure that your rig will negotiate all of them.",
