    "body": "Collection Research and Donations        The Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island exhibit program, and research on the history of immigration to the United States, rely on the museum collection as an important source of information. The supportive function of the museum collection is therefore crucial to fulfilling the Park's mission goals to preserve and interpret the history of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. At the present time, less than one percent of the museum collection is on exhibit at both islands. Research access to the museum collection not on exhibit is by appointment only. A written request clearly describing the reason for the research and the credentials of the researcher is required. All written requests must be submitted at least one week in advance of the desired appointment. Donations are accepted to the museum collection after review. A letter with background information and images of the artifact(s), textile(s) and\/or document(s) is desirable. A donation of a large archival collection does not require images, but a clear description of the contents of the collection is requested. The park cannot guarantee that any donations will be placed on exhibit as the museum collection is primarily used for research and available for loan to other organizations for exhibit or research. Please send all research or donation requests to Geraldine Santoro, Curator of Collections by e-mail Geraldine_Santoro@nps.gov or mail to Statue of Liberty NM, Liberty Island, New York, NY 10004, ATTN: Curator of Collections.
