It is not uncommon to see ground squirrels and quite a few species of resident and migratory birds including hummingbirds. On occasion, foxes and even a coyote have been seen taking shelter or crossing through the memorial grounds. The best times to observe wildlife are at dawn and dusk. Not only do those times of day provide less noise and movement that may scare off the wildlife, but the pattern follows the natural rhythms of life in the Chihuahuan Desert. Bring your binoculars and pick one of the many benches to relax and wait for the view.
