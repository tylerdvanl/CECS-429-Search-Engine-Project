Parks As Classrooms uses the Understanding by Design framework, and incorporates California Common Core Standards, Next Generation Science Standards, and Standards for Literacy in History\/Social Studies.  Our inquiry-based park programs can be timed to introduce concepts, reinforce understanding, or stimulate culminating projects within a teaching unit. Programs are structured in three parts: classroom preparation, a national park field session, and classroom assessments in which students demonstrate what they have learned. Teachers are provided with resources, including learning activities and support materials. Learning activities are designed to allow students to work cooperatively.The first step is to choose the program best suited for your class. Program location and date will be confirmed with NPS staff once you have been selected to participate. So that all students may participate and enjoy their program at Golden Gate National Parks, please take careful note of the following:  Teachers are requested to facilitate the pre-visit classroom lessons to prepare students for their national park experience. Students should be organized into small work groups prior to the field session. Clothing appropriate to the nature of the activities and weather conditions at the park is required. Teachers and adult chaperons are responsible for the conduct of the students. If a studentâ€™s conduct compromises safety at any time, the entire class will be asked to depart immediately. Arrangements can be made to accommodate most students with special needs. Please discuss specific circumstances with National Park Service staff prior to your visit.",
