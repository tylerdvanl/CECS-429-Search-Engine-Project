His house and farm were located in Ooltewah, Tennessee, in Hamilton County near Chattanooga. In 2006, a NPS official learned that the house was in danger of imminent collapse and needed an immediate rescue effort. He contacted specialists with the NPS' Historic Preservation Projects Program; a Challenge Cost Share Program Agreement was arranged with the Tennessee Preservation Trust; and a workshop was held in November 2006 that involved the Tennessee Preservation Trust, the Heritage Conservation Network, and the property owners. The workshop report provides a broad array of architectural, engineering, and structural information aimed toward stabilizing and eventually preserving the James Brown House. John A.
