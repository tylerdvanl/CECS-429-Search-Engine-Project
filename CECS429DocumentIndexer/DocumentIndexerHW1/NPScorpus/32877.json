Identification: Herb Robert is a low-growing (up to ten inches high), herbaceous species. The stems are often dark red and covered with white hairs. Its leaves are made up of three to five leaflets that are long-stemmed and deeply dissected. Flowers are purple, pink, or white with five petals and found from early spring to fall. How is it spreading and where? Herb Robert was introduced from Eurasia and northern Africa. It easily spreads into undisturbed areas and is shade tolerant. It spreads by seeds that are sticky and are launched explosively. In Olympic National Park, it has spread and established itself in several lowland areas.        Herb Robert's dissected leaveshave a feathery look.
