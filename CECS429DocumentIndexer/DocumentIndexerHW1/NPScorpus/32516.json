Photo by Roy Zipp  We Love our Four-Legged Friends! Unlike traditional national parks or national historical parks, which are owned by the American people and exclude private ownership, the Reserve is a living, functioning community, with more than 85 percent of the land privately owned by ordinary citizens, agencies, and organizations. There are spectacular hiking trails and pristine beaches to explore, and your pet will always be welcome! However, dogs must be on-leash on all Reserve trails, and owners should prevent pets from running through privately owned properties. In addition, there is an abundance of wildlife just made for an active dog to pursue: deer, squirrel, rabbit, and coyote abound throughout the Reserve - not to mention other hikers with dogs! If Fido needs to stretch his legs, there is an off-leash dog area called the Patmore Pit Off-Leash area featuring 10 acres for your dog to run. The area features an enclosed agility area and a partially enclosed large \"run free\" area. You'll find plenty of parking, as well as an informational kiosk and picnic tables. Please clean up after your pet wherever you stroll, and be prepared to \"pack it out\" as garbage facilities may not be easily found - especially along hiking trails.
