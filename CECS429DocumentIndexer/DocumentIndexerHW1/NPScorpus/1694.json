Weather, climatic shifts, and geologic processes continue to shape this environment as they have for millennia. More recently, human-caused factors such as air, noise, and water pollution and depletion, as well as introduced species, have had a much greater impact on natural resources worldwide. The undeveloped landscape of Tuzigoot provides an ideal place to study how various environmental factors affect desert ecosystems, and predict what changes might be expected in the future.",
