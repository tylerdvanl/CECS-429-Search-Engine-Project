NPS photo  Over 170 bird species have been identified within the park. The visitor will find very different species when exploring the park depending on the habitat encountered. Within the lower historical district, visitors have the opportunity to view great blue herons (Ardea herodias) and Canada geese (Branta canadensis) along the banks of the ShenandoahCanal. While hiking up Maryland or LoudounHeights, species such as the pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) and Baltimore oriole (Icterus galbula) are likely to be seen.  A bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) may even be observed flying over the park between late winter and early summer. Along with bird species that reside here year round, many other species use the park as a corridor during their spring and fall migrations. Anyone interested in volunteering as an active bird watcher for the park, please contact (304) 535-6770.",
