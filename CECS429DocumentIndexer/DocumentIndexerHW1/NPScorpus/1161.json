Jaggar\"            Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park is easily visited by car in just a few hours or may be explored in more depth over several days. Here are some recommendations when planning your visit to the Park: Visitor Alert - Hazardous Fumes Advisory and Closure of some areas at the Summit of Kilauea One to 3 Hour Visit ? If you have only one to three hours, explore the summit of Kīlauea volcano via Crater Rim Drive; an 11-mile road that encircles the summit caldera, passes through desert, lush tropical rain forest, traverses the caldera floor, and provides access to well-marked scenic stops and short walks. (Note: Crater Rim Drive is closed between Jaggar Museum and the Chain of Craters Road junction due to volcanic activity in Halema'uma'u.) Four to 5 Hour Visit ? If you have four to five hours, you may also explore the East Rift and coastal area of the Park via Chain of Craters Road. This road descends 3,700 feet in 20 miles and ends where lava flows crossed the road in 2003. Explore the Park on Foot Hikers will find an abundance of trails to satisfy their curiosity. Day hikes and backcountry hikes offer great adventures for visitors who wish to explore beyond the roadways.       NPS Photo - Ranger Pauline Leads a Group of Visitors on an Interpretive Hike",
