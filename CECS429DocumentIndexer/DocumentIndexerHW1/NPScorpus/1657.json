While GPS units can be very useful in urban environments, they often lead Walnut Canyon visitors down Forest Road 303, which is unmaintained and frequently requires high clearance. GPS units often do not accurately discern paved from unpaved roads, and may lead you into situations that vary from frustrating to dangerous. By Car  Walnut Canyon National Monument is located approximately 7.5 miles (12km) east of Flagstaff.  To reach Walnut Canyon from Flagstaff, travel east on Interstate 40 toward Albuquerque. Take Exit 204, and head south. The Walnut Canyon Visitor Center is located at the end of this 3 mile road.  Warning: The turn-around area for towed vehicles is small. The maximum recommended length is 40 feet (12 meters).By PlaneThe nearest commercial airport is located in Flagstaff, Arizona.  Public Transportation   None.
