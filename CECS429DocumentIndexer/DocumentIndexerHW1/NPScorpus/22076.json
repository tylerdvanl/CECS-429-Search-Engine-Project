Replenish any firewood stored in the cabin for the next user. Water can be obtained at a small spring located 100 feet downstream of the cabins, or by letting water from the glacially-silted Chitina River settle. Recreational Opportunities: These cabins are located in a remote, rugged area. Make sure you're familiar with backcountry safety before venturing out to hike. There are no developed trails at Jake's Bar, but it is possible to hike up and down the river. Nearby Chitina River is not suitable for fishing and there are no other lakes or streams nearby. If you find a place to fish, a State of Alaska fishing license is required. These cabins are located in the preserve, so sport and subsistence hunting is allowed. Subsistence hunting is limited to local, rural residents. A State of Alaska hunting license is required and, if you are a subsistence hunter, a federal subsistence hunting permit may be required. Please refer to state and federal hunting regulations. These cabins are often used during hunting season. Plan to bring camping supplies in case the cabins are already being used when you arrive.
