Beach accessible wheelchairs are available. Please advise Park staff at check-in that you are requesting a chair. Since the ferry is a passenger only ferry, visitors should plan on walking for all activities. The park's concessioner rents bicycles at Sea Camp. You must check with the ferry deck hands to rent bicycles and this may be done as long as the ferry is in port. Park Service staff does not handle bike rentals. A limited number of personal bikes can be transported on the ferry for an additional fee of $10 per bike. Availability is determined by space and offered on a first come-first served basis.",
