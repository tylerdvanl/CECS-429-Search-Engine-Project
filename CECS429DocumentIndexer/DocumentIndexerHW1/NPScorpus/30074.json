If parking lots are filled, you may have to make alternate arrangements or reschedule your trip to the beach.  Be sure your vehicle is in good condition before attempting a road trip. You may want to carry bottled water and a light snack in case you get stuck in a traffic jam as you cross Long Island. Pack a hefty quantity of patience and enjoy the ride.    Various State of New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority web cams are located at major portals to Long Island (see webcam.mta.info\/mta3).  Â    If you're uncomfortable driving through New York City to get to Long Island, you may be able to reach the island by taking the Bridgeport & Port Jefferson vehicle ferry from Bridgeport, Connecticut to Port Jefferson, NY. Route 112 then crosses Long Island to Patchogue, usually less than an hour's drive south.   The Cross Sound Ferry links New London, CT with Orient Point, NY, on the easternmost end of Long Island. Allow at least 2 hours to drive from Orient Point to Patchogue or Sayville.",
