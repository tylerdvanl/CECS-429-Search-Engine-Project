The site is located near Serpentine Hot Springs,and it contains stone tools and animal bones preliminarily dated to about 12,000 calendar years ago.  Though the theory that humans crossed the Bering Land Bridge to inhabit North America still stands, recent research at this site shows that the original speculations of many scientists who believe that humans populated all of the Americas by traveling from North to South may not be correct. The discovery of fluted points from Serpentine resemble fluted points from temperate America dating to 13,000-12,000 years ago and are not old enough to fit this theory.   Now it would seem that fluted points were brought northwards as glaciers melted and early peoples explored the newly opened territory of northwestern Canada.
