NPS  The Peopling of America exhibit This exciting new undertaking will enlarge the story currently told of the Ellis Island Era (1892-1954) to include the entire panorama of the American immigration experience. It will include exhibits dedicated to those who arrived before Ellis Island opened and those who arrived between 1954 and the present. The goal for this exhibit is to enable all visitors, regardless of when or how their families arrived in the United States, to find \"their stories\" and to make a personal connection to this special unit of the National Park Service.",
