    "body": "Volunteer         Two volunteers prepare for embarking on the Capt. Cook walking tour. nps  Thank you for your interest in volunteering. We at the Alaska Public Lands Information Center in Anchorage feel that we have excellent opportunities for you to make a difference while enjoying the outdoors in Alaska. Anchorage,the largest northern most city in the world, has a ideal combination of urban and nearby wilderness. City parks and coastal trails are within walking distance of downtown Anchorage. Fishing, hiking, and other recreational adventures lie within 20 or 30-minutes driving time or a 10-minute floatplane flight from the city.  The Alaska Public Lands Information Centers combine the information resources of nine federal and state land management agencies. The Centers were mandated by the U.S.Congress in 1980 (1) to provide residents and visitors to Alaska with convenient locations to gather recreational information needed in enjoying public lands and (2) to stimulate environmental education in the local communities throughout the year. Alaska has more than 235 federal or state conservation units which encompass more than 75 percent of the total land area of the state. These areas include Denali and Katmai National Parks, the Arctic and Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuges, Tongass and Chugach National Forests, McNeil River Game Sanctuary, and Chugach State Park. The Alaska Center in Anchorage, managed by the National Park Service, is an exciting single location for planning excursions and learning about the wild and fragile resources of any of these magnificent parks, forests, or wildlife refuges.
