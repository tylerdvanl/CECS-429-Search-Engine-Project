The key aim of teacher networking is the creation of professional learning communities of teachers who, through remote meetings and workshops, maintain ongoing communication and sharing of best practices among colleagues to strengthen knowledge and promote effective teaching strategies.   During 2015 The River Mile is expanding to include the entire Columbia River Watershed. Watch for new opportunities. Join now and begin connecting!

This integrated approach applies the ELA standards to rich content rather than teaching the skills in isolation. The facilitators will model using ELA Performance tasks as a springboard into field studies and project-based learning. The field study provides the anchor experience for the ELA performance task and serves as an introduction to the new Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).   During the workshop teachers will:    build on their Common Core ELA Standards and Assessment background knowledge   gain experience integrating NGSS with ELA standards   walk away with a tool kit to help them customize performance tasks for their curriculum.     Nancy Skerritt, M.A.T., PEI Faculty, retired Assistant Superintendent for Teaching & Learning in the Tahoma School District, has authored & provides in-service on curriculum units and performance tasks and assessment supporting field studies, NGSS & Common Core.   Margaret Tudor, Ph.D in Science Education, as Executive Director of the Pacific Education Institute (PEI), a 501c3, leads the statewide effort to ensure all K-12 students get outside the classroom to learn rigorous Field STEM.
