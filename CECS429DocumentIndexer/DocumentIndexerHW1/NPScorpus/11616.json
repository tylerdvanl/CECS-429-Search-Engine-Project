The curricula provide middle school students with opportunities to observe natural processes at Point Reyes National Seashore and to stimulate interest in science and environmental stewardship. Each curriculum is available for download on this website and a CD with all seven can be ordered by calling 415-464-5139. All activities are linked to the California State Science Standards (2000) and the National Science Standards.      Clem Miller Environmental Education Center The Clem Miller Environmental Education Center is an 80-bed residential facility managed by the Point Reyes National Seashore Association and rented out for 3- to 5-day school field trips, meetings and retreats. Located two miles from Limantour Beach and designed for ecological sustainability, the facility includes a large cedar lodge with dining room, library\/science center and commercial kitchen, five spacious dormitory-style cabins, a bathhouse with hot showers, a large central meadow and a campfire circle. Classroom teachers are required to attend a natural history and environmental education intensive prior to scheduling a trip reservation. Financial assistance is available to designated Title I schools and other groups who can document compelling financial need. Top of Page      Pacific Coast Science and Learning Center at Point Reyes National Seashore Learning centers have been developed to facilitate science and research efforts and provide educational opportunities for the American people to gain new knowledge about the national parks. Learning Centers are field stations for collaborative research activities, providing researchers with laboratory, office, and dormitory facilities. Each center's education specialist will work with park interpreters and partners to make new information about park resources available to the public. Learning centers will also provide hands-on learning experiences for people of all ages, connecting the learner and the researcher. Learning Centers are a part of the Natural Resource Challenge, a strategic long-term approach to the management and care of the nation's most precious resources found within the over 390 parks in the National Park System. The Challenge started as a five-year action plan to expand the National Park System's ability to inventory, monitor, and care for the historical and natural resources under its care. Nineteen Learning Centers have been established as of 2015. Each of these centers is strategically placed at key areas across the country. The hope is that a system of 32 learning centers nationwide will eventually be established.
