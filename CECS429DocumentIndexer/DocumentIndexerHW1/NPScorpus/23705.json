    "body": "Animals         During the warm days of autumn, tarantulas are often seen crossing the trail. Photo by Sally King  With Bandelier's wide range of ecosystems it is the perfect home to a variety of wildlife. Mule deer, Abert's squirrels, lizards, and a number of bird species are the most commonly encountered animals on a visit to the park. Some birds make Bandelier their year-round home while some are seasonal and others only migrate through the park.    When visiting, don't forget, these animals call this place home. Don't harass them and please refrain from feeding them. Many are very photogenic and don't mind having their picture taken. However, never approach too close to wildlife. Even the most timid animal can bite if it feels threatened.",
