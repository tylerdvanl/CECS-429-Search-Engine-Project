In accordance with regulations and the delegated authority provided in Title 36, Code of Federal Regulations (\"36 CFR\"), Chapter 1, Parts 1-7, authorized by Title 16 United States Code, Section 3, the following provisions apply to all lands and waters administered by the National Park Service, within the boundaries of ABRAHAM LINCOLN BIRTHPLACE NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK. Unless otherwise stated, these regulatory provisions apply in addition to the requirements contained in 36 CFR, Chapter 1, Parts 1-7.  The following is the written determination for justifying actions listed in the Compendium (Superintendent's Orders) imposed under the discretionary authority of the Superintendent.  In accordance with 36 CFR 1.5, all designations, closures, permit requirements and other restrictions covered in the Compendium must be based upon determination that such action is necessary. The Superintendent for the protection and safety of the park visitor, natural, and historic resources, and national park values deems these determinations necessary.  In order to protect and present park resources in a manner that allows enjoyment by all park visitors, certain restrictions must be enacted. These restrictions are explained in this determination. This document should be used in conjuction with the Compendium as it explains the reasoning for establishing the restrictions noted in the Compendium.  In accordance with regulations and the delegated authority provided in Title 36, Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1, Section 1.5(c), the following justifications are provided to identify the reasoning behind the use of the Superintendent's discretionary authority in setting forth the various closures, designations, etc. at listed in the Compendium required in Section 1.7 (b).  Section 1.5 Closures and public use limits  (a)(2) Launching, landing, or operating an unmanned aircraft from or on lands and waters administered by the National Park Service within the boundaries of Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park would result in visual and noise impacts that are inconsistent with the historic preservation and memorial mission and values of the park. This activity would conflict with other visitor activities such as viewing the Memorial and the surrounding landscape at the Birthplace Unit or experiencing the 19th century rural landscape and natural quiet of the Boyhood Home Unit. This activity would also endanger public health and safety in highly visited areas of the park such as the park picnic area. Alternatives to prohibition have been considered and rejected because of the level of conflict between the use and the mission and values of the park and because of the small size of the park.  Section 1.5 Closures and public use limits  (a)(2) Launching, landing, or operating an unmanned aircraft from or on lands and waters administered by the National Park Service withing boundaries of Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park is prohibited except as approved in writing by the superintendent.  Definition:  The term \"unmanned aircraft\" means a device that is used or intended to be used for flight in the air without the possibility of direct human intervention from within or on the device, and the associated operational elements and components that are required for the pilot or system operator in command to operate or control the device (such as cameras, sensors, communication links).  This term includes all types of devices that meet this  definition (e.g., model airplanes, quadcopters, drones) that are used for any purpose, including for recreation or commerce.    More  Â    Frequently Asked Questions National Parks and Firearms Q. Why are people allowed to have firearms in some national parks? A. A new federal law (Sec. 512 of P.L. 111-24), effective February 22, 2010, makes national parks - and national wildlife refuges - subject to applicable federal, state, and local firearms laws. The law is a provision of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, which was passed by Congress and signed by the President in May 2009.   Q. How do I know when I'm in a national park? A: National parks will generally have signs indicating that you are entering a national park. In backcountry areas or large expanses such as those in Great Smoky Mountains National Park or Yellowstone National Park, it is up to the individual to know where he or she is and the laws of that state.   Q. I am going to a park that spans two states; can I choose which state's laws to abide by? A: No. It is up to individuals to know the laws of the state they are in and where they are in the park.    Q. What was the law before? Could I bring in an unloaded firearm?  A. You could carry a firearm in many Alaskan national parks and in a limited number of other national parks that allow hunting (when the firearm was brought for the purpose of hunting). Also, people who traveled with firearms could have an unloaded firearm that was rendered inoperable and packed, cased, or stowed when their travels took them through a national park.   Q.  Can I have a firearm in every park after February 22, 2010? A. No. If you can legally possess a firearm in the state in which the national park in located, you can possess it in that park on and after February 22, 2010. It is up to visitors to understand the requirements of federal law and the laws of the states\/localities they live in and are traveling to (or through). Park websites offer basic information about the applicable state law(s) and will generally include a link to a state website with more information.   Q. Can I take a firearm anywhere I go in the park? A. No. Federal law prohibits firearms in \"federal facilities,\" which are generally defined as federally-owned or leased buildings where federal employees work on a regular basis. Buildings that meet this definition will have signs posted at public entrances noting the prohibition on firearms. In addition, privately-owned or -operated facilities within park boundaries may not allow firearms, consistent with the laws of that state.   Q. I've got my firearm, can I hunt while I'm here? A. The new law does not change hunting regulations and laws. A limited number of national parks allow hunting. You must adhere to the park's hunting rules and regulations, which are generally available on a park's website.   Q. I have a permit from my home state to carry a concealed firearm, does that allow me to carry a firearm in a state I am visiting? A. Some permits are recognized in multiple states, many are not. It is up to the individual to know which states accept his or her concealed carry permit.   Q. Where can I find the firearms laws for each state? A: Go to the following link for individual state websites http:\/\/www.usa.gov\/Agencies\/State_and_Territories.shtml   Q. I am worried that having firearms in national parks will affect the safety of my family and the experience we hope to have. Should I still come?  A. For nearly 100 years, the mission of the National Park Service has been to protect and preserve the parks and to help visitors enjoy them. The parks belong to all Americans. Our commitment is to administer the law, administer it fairly, and to ensure the safety of our visitors, the parks and their resources, while all visitors enjoy these special places.
