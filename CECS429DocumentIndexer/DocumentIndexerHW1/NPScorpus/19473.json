    "body": "Special Park Uses       The Special Use Permit (SUP) program authorizes activities that provide benefit to an individual, group or organization, rather than the public at large; and that require written authorization and some management control in order to protect park resources and the public interest. Examples include special events, commercial filming\/still photography, weddings, scattering of ashes, First Amendment activities, agricultural permits and right-of-way (ROW) easements. Special Use Permits are granted for specific periods of time and specific locations. Certain cost recovery, fees and insurance requirements may apply. Non-Profit Organizations When engaging in activities on park area lands, a non-profit organization is required to obtain a Special Use Permit or other appropriate authorization as may otherwise be required by National Park Service policies and regulations. Certain cost recovery, fees and insurance requirements may apply. A non-profit organization is an organization that has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be exempt from Federal income taxation as a nonprofit or not-for-profit organization under the terms of the Internal Revenue Code.
