    "body": "How to Donate       Monetary Contributions In addition to our donation box at the visitor center, Prince William Forest Park maintains a general donation account into which contributions and donations are deposited. The donor receives a letter of acknowledgement from the park superintendent and other recognition, as appropriate. Unless the donor specifies how they would like the funds to be spent, general donation account funds are used at the park’s discretion for interpretive, educational or research projects. Large donations may be earmarked for specific projects determined mutually by the donor and the park. Direct contributions can be sent to Prince William Forest Park, 18100 Park Headquarters Road, Triangle, VA 22172. Checks should be made out to the National Park Service.      Donation of Items Prince William Forest Park accepts donations of goods that support park needs and museum artifacts for the museum collection.  These items can range from picnic tables, compost, and office paper, to important historical artifacts that have been legally obtained.  While the National Park Service is grateful for donation of items, individuals wishing to donate an item should contact the park to ensure that it meets a park need. If the item is not determined necessary, a grateful declination of the donation may occur.  Please note that it is against National Park Service policy to memorialize or name a feature or facility for an individual.         Become a Friend The purpose of this non-profit organization is to fund and organize projects and activities that help preserve and enhance Prince William Forest Park.
