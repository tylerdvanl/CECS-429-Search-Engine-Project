    "body": "Oasis on the High Plains  Within the dry and windswept high plains of the Texas Panhandle lies a hidden oasis, a welcoming haven where wildlife and humans find respite from the dry grasslands above. Through this plain, the Canadian River has cut dramatic 200-foot canyons, or breaks, where humans have eked out a living for over 13,000 years. Lake Meredith now occupies these hidden coves where early humans once roamed.              Hiking Around Lake Meredith   Enjoy a pleasant stroll though a quiet river valley or a steep hike up to the top of a mesa.            Camping at Lake Meredith   Lake Meredith National Recreation Area offers a variety of campgrounds where you can enjoy the lake or get a bit off the beaten path.        Get Out On The Lake   Bring your boat and explore the lake!",
