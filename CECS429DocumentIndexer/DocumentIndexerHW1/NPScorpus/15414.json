Jeff Manuszak  The goals of the fire management program at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore are to manage wildland fire to protect the public and communities, conserve natural and cultural resources, and restore and maintain ecological health.   The Fire Management program in Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore encompasses a wide variety of disciplines. The Lakeshore Fire Management staff includes: the fire management officer, a wildland fire specialist, a fire program managment assistant, firefighters, fire effects personnel, and a fire prevention and education technician. They perform a full range of wildland fire management operations and services, including; fire prevention and education, planned ignitions and suppression of unplanned ignitions, hazard fuels management, monitoring, and research. See the fire program's 2012 accomplishments.  The staff is also responsible for overseeing the fire management operations at 3 other parks in the Midwest. These park units include: Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial, and Cuyahoga Valley National Park.  The plans and actions of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore Fire Management staff are guided by the lakeshores Fire Management Plan.(970kb pdf)        backing fire through oak savanna   Planned Ignitions                    Prescribed fire is used to ignite low intensity fires when weather conditions are right. The goal of prescribed fire is to reduce hazardous fuel build-up, while safely reintroducing fire to the ecosystem to meet specific resource management objectives.
