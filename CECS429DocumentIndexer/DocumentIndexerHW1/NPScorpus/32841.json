Two species (marbled murrelet and spotted owl) are listed as \"threatened\" under the federal Endangered Species Act.      Some Birding Resources:   Bird Checklist Leavenworth Spring Bird Fest  Great Washington State Birding Trail (Audubon Washington)  Skagit Eagle Festival  Merlin Falcon Foundation Skagit River Bald Eagle Interpretive Center        The North Cascades is one of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet. Animals with fins, fur, feathers and scales are all at home in this dramatic and beautiful environment. Elusive mammals like the gray wolf, fisher and wolverine wander the wilderness in small numbers, while more adaptable Columbia black-tailed deer, Douglas squirrels and pikas delight park visitors in abundance. Fish and amphibians lurk in the clear mountain lakes and streams. The rich forests, rocky slopes and clean waters teem with invertebrate life, such as butterflies, dragonflies, stoneflies and mayflies.North Cascades is home to approximately 75 mammal species in 20 families; around 21 species of reptiles and amphibians representing at least four orders; at least 28 species of fish; and recent surveys have documented over 500 types of land insects and approximately 250 aquatic invertebrate species.     Some Wildlife Viewing Resources:Fish Checklist (pdf 120 kb)Mammal Checklist (pdf 462 kb)Reptile and Amphibian Checklist (pdf 269 kb)",
