Through guided observation and sensory exploration, students will collect clues while they identify and compare shapes, patterns, and sounds of the forest to heighten their awareness of the diversity of the natural world.  Subject\/Keywords: Senses, Discovery, Observation, Shapes, Patterns, Sounds  Grade Level: K-3 Location: Kautz, Longmire  Standards: LS1-1, ESS2-3, PS1-1  Habitats of Mount Rainier: There's No Place Like Home From the seedlings in the soil to birds on the branches, the forests of Mount Rainier support an abundance of life! Join a ranger and investigate an old growth forest habitat. Students will observe, describe, compare, and categorize both the living and the nonliving components of this special environment.  Subject\/Keywords: Habitat, Forest, Interdependence, Food Chain, Trees, Animal\/Plant Structures, Observations, Investigations, Life Zone, Biodiversity, Abiotic, Biotic Grade Level: 3-5 Location: Longmire, Ohanapecosh Standards: LS4, LS1, PS3-1  Locked in Rocks: Clues from the Past Geologists from around the world study the rocks, glaciers, and streams around Mount Rainier to gain insight into its volcanic past. Unlock the clues of the explosive history of Mount Rainier while learning about the anatomy of a volcano, the powerful forces behind an eruption, and the movement and cooling of lava on a stratovolcano.  Subject\/Keywords: Volcanos, Rocks, Earth Formation, Eruption, Erosion, Glaciers, Geology  Grade Level: 3-5 Location: Longmire Standards: PS2-3, ESS1-1, PS1-3  Glistening Glaciers and Raging Rivers: Watersheds of Mount Rainier At 14,410 feet Mount Rainier can make its own weather. Its powerful presence affects everything from the glaciers that crown its peak to the rivers that flow into the Puget Sound and on into the Pacific Ocean. Learn about these important watersheds from the summit to the sea and what can we do to protect them.  Subject\/Keywords: Watersheds, Water Cycles, Weather, Climate, Glaciers, Rivers, Climate Change  Grade Level: 4-6 Location: Paradise (Snowshoe Program)  Standards: ESS2  Survival Sleuths: Animal Adaptions Mount Rainier is a land of extremes from the frozen alpine summit to lush lowland forests. How do animals survive in this rugged environment? Students will learn about successful strategies, as well as the internal and external structures that allow animals to adapt and prosper in this environment.  Subject\/Keywords: Adaptions, Life Zones, Internal\/External Structures, Food Chain, Predator-Prey Relationships, Survival Strategies, Behavior  Grade Level: 4-6 Location: Longmire Standards: LS1-1, LS2  Warning - Signs of Hazards Ahead Mount Rainier, part of the Ring of Fire, is an active volcano and still emits signs of the activity beneath the Earth's crust. Past eruptions have caused substantial change to the landscape below and future activity will have a huge impact on hundreds of thousands of people in the Puget Sound region. Join a ranger to discover signs of past geological events and disturbances that have occurred on the slopes of Mount Rainier. How can these signs help us prepare for the future?  Subject\/Keywords: Volcanism, Hazards, Catastrophic Events, Erosion, Eruption, Construction\/Destruction, Emergency Management  Grade Level: 4-6 Location: Longmire Standards: PS3, ESS2  This Dynamic Volcano Mount Rainier is a place of constant change, whether over the course of 500,000 years or over a single day. A clear, bright, sunny day can quickly become a dark, ominous, snow storm. As volcanic eruptions build the mountain up with new layers of lava, the eroding glaciers grind it down. No two days are the same in this landscape as wind, water, ice, and volcanic activity shape the land. Join a ranger to learn about this dynamic volcano.   Subject\/Keywords: Volcanism, Plate Tectonics, Weather, Earth Systems, Glaciers, Erosion  Grade Level: 6-8 Location: Paradise (Snowshoe Program)  Standards: ESS2, ESS3  A Disturbingly Wild Story of Succession: Mount Rainier Investigation Mount Rainier's wild lands present unparalleled research opportunities to study the intricate relations between abiotic and biotic factors. In this science investigation students carry on the long-standing tradition of field research, unlock the mysteries of ecological disturbances, forecast the story of succession, and compare their results to current park research.  Subject\/Keywords: Investigation, Scientific Method, Disturbance, Erosion, Catastrophic Events, Abiotic, Biotic, Ecosystem Dynamics  Grade Level: 6-10 Location: Kautz Creek  Standards: LS2  At Home in the Snow For most of the year the slopes of Mount Rainier are blanketed in snow and blasted by wind; yet despite these arctic conditions life has found a way to not only survive but depend on the snow for survival. Through guided investigations and hands-on activities students will explore the critical role of snow, for those living on and around the mountain.  Subject\/Keywords: Snow, Investigation, Weather, Watershed, Survival  Grade Level: 7-12 Location: Paradise (Snowshoe Program)  Standards: LS1, LS2, PS3-1, ESS2  Survival of the Fittest Record snowfall. Plummeting temperature. Gusting wind. As one of the snowiest places on the planet, Mount Rainier poses many challenges to both human visitors and the plant and animals living on the Mountain. Why do people seek challenges in their life? What structures and strategies do plants and animals (including humans) use to allow them to survive in this environment?   Subject\/Keywords: Survival, Risk, Adaption  Grade Level: 7-12 Location: Paradise (Snowshoe Program)  Standards: ESS3",
