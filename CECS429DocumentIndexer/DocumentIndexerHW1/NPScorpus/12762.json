    "body": "Trail Conditions           Mather Pass Jessie Wheeler  Here you will find the most recent trail conditions available. Be prepared for rapidly changing conditions. Thunderstorms are common during the summer months and can turn a clear day into a threatening situation in a matter of hours. Consider all possibilities before you head out on your trip and check out the Trail Safety page for more information on the dangers of wilderness travel. At the end of September wilderness rangers are removed from the field and updated conditions become less available. You can help us by sending an email to report trail conditions. In general, you should expect winter conditions across the Parks' wilderness. For more information please call the Wilderness Office at (559) 565-3766. For snowpack data, visit the California Department of Water Resources snow survey website. Climbing Mt. Langley During a project to restore the route to the top of Mount Langley, miles of social trails were removed and a new route was marked with cairns. If you climb Mount Langley, please leave the cairns in place and use them to follow the new route.        Cedar Grove and Roads EndThe road into Cedar Grove and Roads End has opened for the season.  Lewis Creek and Kennedy Pass6\/22 - Kennedy Pass from our approach on the Lewis Creek TH it was snow-free until almost the top. There was only one patch of snow, easily walked through. At the very top there was snow with some small sun cups, and the trail got lost in it. Looking down the north side was solid snow to a tarn that is directly down the north slope of the pass based on the trail map, we believe the snow field covered the switchbacks of the trail down the mountain.
