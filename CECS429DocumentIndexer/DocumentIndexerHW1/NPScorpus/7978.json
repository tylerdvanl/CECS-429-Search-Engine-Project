To protect the fragile and ecologically sensitive slopes of the mountain, Parkway planners designed the award-winning Linn Cove Viaduct, a symbol of pride to landscape architects and engineers for its marriage of beauty with utility and habitat protection. Visitors here will gain an appreciation for the care that was taken in construction of the entire Parkway. From the first colorful displays of wildflowers in spring, to the refreshing coolness of summer, and the brilliant fall color on the side of Grandfather Mountain, each season provides a different Parkway experience.
