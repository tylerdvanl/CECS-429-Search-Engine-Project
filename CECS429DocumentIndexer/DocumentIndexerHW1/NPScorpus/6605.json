Firearms Policy - As of February 22, 2010, a new federal law allows people who can legally possess firearms under applicable federal, state, and local laws, to legally possess firearms on lands owned by the National Park Service in this park unit. It is the responsibility of visitors to understand and comply with all applicable state, local and federal firearms laws before entering this park.

The Niobrara NSR has a complex pattern of land ownership with most of the land bordering the river outside of the Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge being privately owned. Please respect private property rights in your river use. Please check with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Fort Niobrara Refuge (402)-376-5908 for their policies concerning firearms possession on the Niobrara NSR through the refuge (5.5 miles downstream from Cornell Bridge Landing to the Refuge boundary, 1.7 miles upstream from Berry Bridge Landing).",
