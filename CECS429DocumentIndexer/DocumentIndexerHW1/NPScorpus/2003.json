They have different amenities and offer campers a choice between modern comforts and rustic wilderness. However, at either campground you may see the desert, dark sky subtlety illuminated by countless stars or shadows that are awakened under a full moon's glow. Songs of coyotes or the hum of a breeze may lull you to sleep. Awaken with a blazing sunrise and hike one of the trails that originate at the campgrounds.
