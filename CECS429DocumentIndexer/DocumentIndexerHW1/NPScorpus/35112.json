    "body": "Overnight Backcountry Permits       All overnight trips in the backcountry require a permit. The Orange Cliffs Unit of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area shares Canyonlands' western boundary and is administered under the same backcountry management plan and permit\/reservation system. Permits are also required for:  Day-use vehicle, motorcycle, and bicycle travel on White Rim, Elephant Hill, Lavender Canyon, and Horse Canyon \/ Peekaboo roads. (If you already have an overnight backcountry permit, you do not need a day-use permit.) Horseback riding River Trips       You must have a printed and signed permit in your possession during your entire trip. A permit is not valid from any mobile device.      Canyonlands National Park reserves the right to deny or cancel backcountry reservations if the following are deemed to be adversely impacted: visitor use activities (e.g., campsites are reserved with no intention of use), federal regulations or administrative policies, public health or safety, environmental or scenic values, natural or cultural resources.        When to Apply Backcountry permits are issued seven days a week at district visitor centers and the Hans Flat Ranger Station. You can reserve permits in advance (see below). Walk-in permits are available no more than 24 hours before the trip. Permits are issued up to one hour before the close of business each day. Please review the backcountry regulations before obtaining a permit. How to Apply Do I Need a Reservation? Reservations are recommended, but not required. Currently, competition is greatest for White Rim trips during the spring and fall and Needles backpacking trips during spring. For these activities, visitors should apply as early as possible. Campsites and permits not reserved in advance are available first-come, first-served basis at district visitor centers.
