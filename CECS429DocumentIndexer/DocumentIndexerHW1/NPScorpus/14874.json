The park is a protective haven for these western plants that were once so plentiful but have been extirpated from most of their eastern range. A good example is the Western Dwarf Dandelion, Krigia occidentalis. Mammoth Cave National Park is the only site in Kentucky where this plant has ever been found, although it is not uncommon in the western prairie states.      Total ecosystem management philosophies, including reestablishment of grasslands and the use of tools such as controlled burning, ensure that Mammoth Cave National Park will preserve the natural heritage of the area and make the park a Mecca for those who cherish wildflowers and the healthy ecosystems that support such specie abundance.",
