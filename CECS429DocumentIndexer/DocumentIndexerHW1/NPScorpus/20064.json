    "body": "Education         NPS Photo  Cumberland Island National Seashore is a diverse blend of history, environment, and recreation. The island's 4,000 years of human history began with the Timucuan Indians and later included Spanish missionaries, British settlers, early American patriots and enslaved African Americans. After the industrial revolution swept the country, wealthy families sought solace on the island both as land owners and vacationers. Cumberland Island is also the story of nature; over 18 miles long, Cumberland is the longest and most diverse of all Georgia barrier islands. Home to the largest, intact maritime forest and coastal Wilderness on the east coast, Cumberland is a special place. Our educational program reflects the diversity of the Georgia coast. Please explore the resources on our Parks as Classrooms page to learn how you can introduce your students to the amazing history and natural beauty of Cumberland Island.
