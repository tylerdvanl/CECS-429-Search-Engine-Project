Volunteers also have the opportunity to protect this extraordinary place and share it with visitors from around the world. As a volunteer with the National Park Service, you can become a part of a team with a long tradition of public service. Your principal duties will be to answer visitors' questions, lead guided tours, and roam the park site to answer inquiries.
