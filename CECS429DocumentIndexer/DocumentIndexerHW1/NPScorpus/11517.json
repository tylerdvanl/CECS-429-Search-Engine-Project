    "body": "What is Point Reyes Doing about Climate Change?       The human race collectively is facing one of its most important and urgent challenges in responding to the potential consequences of global climate change. Government, society, corporations and individuals must raise their awareness of the causes and outcomes of global climate change and become involved in reversing the current warming trend with its potential ecological, social and economic consequences. Reversing the current trend requires knowledge, understanding and the commitment of everyone to reduce energy usage and diminish carbon emissions that contribute to climate change. The National Park Service, as the nation's premier resource stewardship agency, needs to provide leadership by setting a good example through conservation and education in order to effect change in current national energy usage and carbon emission trends. Point Reyes National Seashore intends to become a model of thoughtful and environmentally conscientious resource stewardship. The Seashore desires to promote public awareness of the need for society as a whole to act responsibly about conservation and energy use. The Organic Act which established the National Park Service calls for us to act so as to leave parks unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations. Ignoring the likely impacts of global climate change on our parks or not acting soon to reverse them would be inconsistent with that mandate. The Superintendent and park managers at Point Reyes National Seashore recognize that global climate change will have a significant effect on park resources. Managers are currently attempting to assess these impacts and how the National Park Service can mitigate or prevent the damage or loss of historic and natural resources. Many current research projects are taking a close look at these impacts.

They discussed the pioneering work taking place at the National Seashore in addressing the effects of climate change—the park's sustainability outreach and education programs, composting and other waste diversion projects, energy management and conservation, water management and conservation, and alternative transportation projects.
