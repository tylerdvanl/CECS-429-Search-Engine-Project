There will be delays during that period, along with a few multi-hour closures. There may also be daytime delays, up to 5 minutes either way. more              Roads There is only one road in Denali, called the Denali Park Road. Part of it is open to private vehicles year-round, while in summer most of it is open only to various kinds of buses. The map below indicates how far private vehicles may drive (green section) and how far bus service is traveling (gold section). In summer, the farthest a person can drive in their own vehicle is to Savage River, about 15 miles inside the park, barring any unusually bad weather or wildlife-related closures. Campgrounds Open campgrounds are shown on the map below with a green camping icon and closed campgrounds are red. Click on a given campground to learn more about it.  Weather  Head over to NOAA.gov for the current weather forecast. Please note that the forecast area is really large, and the mountains here make the weather very changeable. Learn more about Denali's climate and weather trends. Mosquitoes  Less predictable than the weather, but generally mosquitoes are a nuisance from late May through early August in most of the park. Hikers and campers should consider bringing bug spray \/ repellant, or at least having long sleeves and pants to cover most exposed skin.

Most park visitors will be unaffected by this information. Work at \"night\" can still impact regular bus operations or visitors coming at particularly late or early hours, however.   Below are part of the \"Public Traffic Construction Requirements\" given to road contractors. These are particular to a 2016 project involving road construction on the first 15 miles of the park road and describe the kinds of delays a contractor is allowed to cause.

A new Alpine Tundra webcam, perched high atop a shoulder of Mount Healy along the park’s Outer Range, offers a westward perspective for several miles beyond the entrance area. Snow and extreme conditions may obscure the view at times. The image is set to refresh several times each minute.   View webcam",
