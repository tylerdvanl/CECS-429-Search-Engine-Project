This quietest season of the year offers some unique experiences in the park. The Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive and Baker Creek Road are both closed to vehicle traffic, but open to skiers and showshoers. Winter camping is available in the Lower Lehman Creek Campground, which remains open all year, or in the backcountry. Lehman Caves Tours are also offered year round, with the advantage of small group sizes during the winter months. Be aware of the unique safety challenges of recreating in a remote winter environment. Please be advised that no food service exists in the park during the winter, and goods and services in Baker are limited. Skiing and Snowshoeing Novice skiers can find gentle slopes for touring or experienced ski mountaineers can challenge their skills on steep and deep backcountry runs. Visitors must bring all of their own equipment.  Trails and roads in the park are not groomed, though some routes are flagged with tape. Snow conditions range from wet or hard packed snow to fresh dry powder. For current snow conditions, call (775) 234-7510.  Winter Backcountry Camping The same regulations for camping in the backcountry during the summer apply in the winter. Day use areas, such as the Wheeler Peak area, remain closed to camping all year. Visitors may camp in the closed Wheeler Peak Campground during the winter at no charge.    Â      Trails like the Lehman Creek Trail allow for great winter use. NPS PHOTO   Winter Trail Descriptions The more popular trails and routes for skiing and snowshoeing in the park are described below. Trails are not groomed. In general, there are no flat or completely level trails. They all begin by climbing uphill, and include varying degrees of downhill to return to the trailhead. Trailhead elevations begin around 7,000 ft.  Those routes that leave main roads may require map reading or orienteering skills, as not all trails are flagged. Know your abilities and limitations, and be sure to carry proper winter equipment and gear.
