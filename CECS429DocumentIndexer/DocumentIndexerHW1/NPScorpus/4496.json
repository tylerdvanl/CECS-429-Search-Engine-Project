Visitors need to give advance notice to get it setup for passengers in need of accessibility. There is a ramp at the Fort Jefferson dock in which power chair\/wheelchair can disembark from the boat. The 19th century brick fort has three floors and wheelchairs are not able to get to the second and third tier. The fort is accessible only on the first tier on the grass surface or the brick walkway as well as the trail on the outside of the fort.",
