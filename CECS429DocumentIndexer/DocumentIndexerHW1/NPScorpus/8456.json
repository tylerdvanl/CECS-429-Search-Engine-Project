    "body": "Kayaking & Canoeing        With 112 miles of uninhabited shoreline, ranging from docile sound to pounding surf, Cape Lookout National Seashore has become one of the premier paddling destinations on the Mid-Atlantic coast. Jeff Lovett, NC Outward Bound       Nowhere else on the southeast coast will you encounter an uninterrupted barrier island chain in such pristine condition on the magnitude of Cape Lookout National Seashore. The islands of the seashore lie between two and three miles from the mainland. At this distance even novice paddlers can cross the open waters of Core Sound and Back Sound under good conditions. While everyone can enjoy exploring the marshes and shallow waters of the sounds, the more ambitious kayaker can continue out the inlets into the surf. In recent years, kayak fishing has become a popular activity in the shallow waters of the seashore. With the ability to reach beyond casting range, into the marshes inaccessible by powerboats, the kayak has become a powerful tool in the angler's bag of tricks.      Planning Your Paddle A little planning can go a long way towards making your trip safe and enjoyable. In addition to bringing the right equipment (Sea Kayaker Magazine has an in-depth equipment list as a pdf of 90 kb), it is also a good idea to pay attention to the tides and weather. Tides   Proper consideration of tides at the seashore will make or break a trip. Learning how to read and use a tide chart can make the difference between paddling with or against a 3 knot current. The best bet for most people is to leave the mainland at high tide, so you are going out with the tide, and to return as the low tide rises. Most paddlers will want to avoid the rage tide, the time when the current flows the hardest, as ½ of the total water volume passes through inlets during the third and fourth hours of tide flow. During this time, flatwater will turn to whitecap waves and intermediate terrain can become expert. Pick-up a tide chart from local marine stores, or view tide predications from NOAA, just remember the tides shown for Cape Lookout indicate levels on the oceanside and those shown for the Cape Lookout Bight indicate levels in the \"hook\" of the cape, not the lighthouse area (sound side) or on Harkers Island.   Weather   Weather moves quickly and often unexpectedly on the coast. Kayakers should monitor weather reports and carry a marine radio. Check the latest local weather reports including boating conditions and wind advisories.    Safety Tips  Wear a PFD (life-jacket). There are two kinds of kayakers: those who have flipped and those who will! Kayak with a group or guide. There is safety in numbers and experience. Be familiar with rescue techniques and equipment such as paddle floats, bilge pumps, tow lines, rescue stirrups, etc. Carry a spare paddle. Carry a flashlight or headlamp and keep it accessible from the cockpit. You may need to signal powerboats to alert them of your presence. Carry extra food and water: you can always take home excess.         Cape Lookout National Seashore  Float Plans If you are launching from Shell Point or leaving your car at the Harkers Island Visitor Center, we ask that you leave a float plan with park staff. You can do this in person at the Harkers Island Visitor Center, by fax at (252) 728-2160 with attn: Interpretation Division, or by sending an e-mail (e-mail us).  Files may not be attached if you use the \"email us\" form. If you would like to attach a completed PDF float plan, please email CALO_Information @ nps.gov using your email account.   Remember to check in when you return: you can come into the Visitor Center, call (252-723-2250), or e-mail us. If you do not check in, we will call your emergency contact to verify your return. You can bring your own float plan, download our float plan (pdf, 69 kb), or fill one out when you arrive. If you are launching from another location, we recommend you leave a float plan with someone local (a ferry operator if you are leaving your car with one of the ferry services, a friend who will see you when you return, etc.). The Visitor Center parking lot is locked from 5:00 PM to 9:00 AM, even when there is a car in the lot. You can park in the can park at the picnic area across the street (Shell Point) if you will be returning after 5:00 PM. Trail Maps and Routes Two trail maps have been created by the Crystal Coast Canoe & Kayak Club. One map includes Harkers Island, Shackleford Banks, and the Lighthouse and Cape Point areas of South Core Banks. The other map covers North Core Banks and most of South Core Banks. These maps are now out of print, but a limited number are available at the Harkers Island Visitor Center. Both maps are available for viewing at the Harkers Island Visitor Center.  The Outer Banks Scenic Byway has created a Down East Paddle Trail Map (pdf, 7.2 MB) which includes trails to Cape Lookout National Seashore. It is also a good idea to get nautical charts for your trip; these can be obtained at local retailers. The nautical charts that pertain to this area are 11544 (ocean side), 11545, and 11550. You can also view the nautical charts online through the NOAA website. Camping Looking to extend your paddle or your visit?
