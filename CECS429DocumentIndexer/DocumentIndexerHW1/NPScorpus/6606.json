    "body": "River Management Planning       It helps to have a solid plan before starting a project to improve and protect the value of your home. The same is true for how the National Park Service manages nationally important sites to protect their unique resources and values for all Americans now and for the future. We need your ideas and input to craft a River Management Plan (RMP) and environmental assessment (EA) for Niobrara National Scenic River (NSR) which will guide management actions to protect the unique geologic, scenic, recreational, fossil, fish and wildlife values as well as the water quality and quantity of river flow on which these values depend. Please take an active role to protect the nationally unique resources of the river and improve visitor experiences of them by participating in this multi-year public process. As opportunities arise, they will be listed here.",
