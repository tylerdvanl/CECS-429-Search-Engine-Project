NPS\/VanTatenhove  The St. Croix and Namekagon rivers offer many paddling options. Choose an easy stretch or one with challenges. Plan a day trip or a multi-day excursion. Find solitude or paddle in a more social setting. Whatever you choose, there are important steps to consider when planning a paddle.      Step 1: Choose a River Stretch  River descriptions and distance charts help narrow the choices. ( Namekagon Ι Upper St. Croix Ι Lower St. Croix ) Detailed river maps show campsites, rapids, landings, and other facilities. Rangers recommend river stretches for different paddling skills. Talk to a ranger! St. Croix River Visitor Center: (715) 483-2274 Namekagon River Visitor Center: (715) 635-4683       Step 2: Secure Paddle Equipment and Shuttles  Outfitters provide equipment and shuttle services throughout the Riverway. Many also provide shuttle services for paddlers with their own equipment. Vehicles can be left in Riverway parking lots overnight, but keep valuables out of sight and remember to bring your keys with you!       Step 3: Get Permits & Find Out About Fees    If you are using a landing in a state park, you need a state park entrance sticker unless you are using an outfitter. You will need a camping permit if you plan an overnight stay between Highway 8 and the High Bridge.        Step 4: Pack Your Gear    Make sure you have a life jacket for each person. Children under 13 are required to wear one. A suggested packing list is on the safety information sheet. Bring drinking water and suntan lotion. Water shoes keep your feet safe from fish hooks, glass, and sharp rocks.       Step 5: Check Conditions   Remember to check river levels and the weather before you go.           Step 6: Take River Safety Seriously  A life jacket only works if you are wearing it. Make a trip plan and leave it with someone. Call 911 for emergencies. Cell phone service is spotty on some stretches. If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so responsibly. More safety tips.       Step 7: Stay Healthy  Learn about tick borne illnesses and blastomycosis. Poison ivy grows along the Riverway. Don't drink the river water without filtering it first.",
