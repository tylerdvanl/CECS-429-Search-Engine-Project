Curriculum-based field trips are available for all grades K-12. All Field Trips     Traveling Trunks During his years at Tuskegee Institute, Carver designed and outfitted the first movable school, known as the Jesup Wagon, as an outreach to rural families who were unable to travel to the school. The George Washington Carver traveling trunk has a similar purpose, reaching out to children who may not be able to visit the park. Traveling trunks are available for loan on a monthly basis.
