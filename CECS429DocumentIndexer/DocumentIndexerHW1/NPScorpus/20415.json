This time, he brought 12 men, making the shallop less crowded and more comfortable. On this trip, Smith reached the head of the Chesapeake Bay and determined there was no route to the Pacific. The voyage covered a lot of territory and brought him in contact with many different Indian tribes but was marked by sickness, conflict, and a crewman's death.
