NPS       Did you know that Albert Cashier, a soldier honored in the Illinois Monument, was actually a woman? Or that John Wesley Powell, an artillery commander at Vicksburg, went on to explore the Grand Canyon… with only one arm? Individual stories of courage and dedication often get lost within the broader scope of the Campaign and Siege of Vicksburg. Vicksburg National Military Park, however, has recently teamed up with 145 other parks to create the Civil War trading card program. Each park in the program has created its own set of cards designed to tell stories like Cashier's and Powell's. Vicksburg National Military Park currently has two sets available. The Military Stories collection highlights the accomplishments of commanding officers while the Civil War to Civil Rights honors the contribution of African Americans, women, and children. Each card comes with its own mission. Check out the links below to find out how to earn your cards and print a guide (.pdf) to bring along with you for your adventures in the park!
