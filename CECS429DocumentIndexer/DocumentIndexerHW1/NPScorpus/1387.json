    "body": "Places To Go         The ruin of Welch Hospital sits over the opening to Welch Cave. It was thought that cool cave air would benefit \"consumption\" patients. It didn't work and Dr Diehl's hospital soon went under.   There is so much to explore in and around the Ozark National Scenic Riverways! There are springs, caves, mills, even a waterfall. These pages will give you some idea of what awaits you, but the best thing to do is just get out there and explore. Who knows what you'll discover?  Alley Spring and Mill  Big Spring  Round Spring and Cave  Devils Well  Blue Spring  Rocky Falls  Klepzig Mill  Jam Up Cave  Welch Spring and Hospital    PARK MAP (.pdf file)  Â     A visitor enjoying the solitude and beauty of Blue Spring.
