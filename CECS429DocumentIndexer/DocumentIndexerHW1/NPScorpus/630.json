    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Places To Go     Royal Grounds              The Royal Grounds      In the past, chiefs entered the royal grounds from Keone'ele Cove by canoe. The pū (conch shell) is sounded to warn of thier approach, for it is forbidden for others to look upon or even cast their shadow on the ali'i (chiefs).  As the canoe makes land fall, other members of the royal court stroll past the royal fishponds, looking for a choice fish for dinner. Other chiefs may engage in a game of kōnane.  The spectacular golden colors of sunset play upon the vast ocean. The beauty, splendor and history of the royal grounds at Pu'uhonua o Hōnaunau are still felt as you take a self-guided walking tour along the trails once reserved for Hawaiian royalty. The Royal Grounds are still considered a sacred site.  Therefore, the following restrictions are in effect.  No smoking, nudity, beach chairs, mats, towels, beach umbrellas, coolers, picnicking, weddings, pets and recreational activities are permitted.  Please help to preserve the Royal Grounds for future generations.",
