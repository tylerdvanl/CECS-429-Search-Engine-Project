The Plan provides guidance for the preservation and use of the Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site, Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site (Val-Kill), and the Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site. It lays out broad, long-term strategies for managing the parks in the 21st Century, with an emphasis on partnerships, revitalizing historic landscapes, more diverse programming, and alternative approaches to securing funding to maintain all our important resources. We look forward to working closely with partners, volunteers, and community members to implement the Plan. For an electronic copy of the plan, click here. (4.65 MB pdf)",
