There is a water fountain in the Reception Center and bottled water is sold in the Bookstore.  Most of your walking will be on paved or graveled walkways. Nevertheless, check for ticks after your visit.  Watch your step especially as you exit down the bus steps, head down the back stairs of the Eisenhower home, and walk up the bank into the barn.  Donâ€™t try to tip the cows or annoy the bull.",
