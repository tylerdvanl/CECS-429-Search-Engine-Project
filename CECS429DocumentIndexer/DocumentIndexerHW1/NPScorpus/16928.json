There are few established trails in the park, but hikers can follow canyon bottoms, open desert washes, alluvial fans and abandoned dirt roads to get around.  Backpackers are requested to obtain a free backcountry permit at either the Furnace Creek Visitor Center or the Stovepipe Wells Ranger Station. Leave No Trace guidelines should be followed to minimize impacts on the fragile desert environment. Overnight group size is limited to 12 people and no more than 4 vehicles. Larger groups will need to split up and camp at least 1\/2 mile apart. Campfires are not allowed in the backcountry. Use a campstove instead.   Pets are not allowed on trails or in the wilderness. However, pets are allowed on the Furnace Creek bike path and hundreds of miles of backcountry dirt roads.
