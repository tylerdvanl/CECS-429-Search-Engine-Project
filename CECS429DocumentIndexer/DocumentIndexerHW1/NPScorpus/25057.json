    "title": "Kenai Fjords National Park: Reporting Requirements",
    "body": "Reporting Requirements       Recreational use of backcountry areas, including Aialik and the Harding Icefield Trail appears to be growing every year, resulting in increased resource impacts. Registration allows us to collect information on visitor use that helps with park planning and management, such as determining where bear boxes are placed or where impact monitoring should be conducted. Registration also allows us an opportunity to give basic resource protection and safety information to ALL overnight visitors.  The Day Use Summary is required for all guided hiking on the Harding Icefield Trail and guided ice hiking on Exit Glacier. The Voluntary Backcountry Registration (VBR) is required for all guided overnight trips anywhere in the park (does not include Exit Glacier Campground) OR any guided day trip in any coastal area of the park.",
