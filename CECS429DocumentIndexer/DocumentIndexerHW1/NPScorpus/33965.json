    "body": "Virtual Tour Stop, Higgerson Farm        Some of the heaviest and most confusing fighting occurred on the Higgerson Farm. Permelia Higgerson was at home as Union soldiers swept past her dwelling, trampled her garden and disappeared into the woods. As Yankees hurried past her, she taunted them, predicting that they would soon be coming back with Confederates at their heels. Her words proved prophetic.         A short trail leads to the site of the Higgerson House, which was destroyed in the 1930's.         Union soldiers of General James Wadsworth's division battled Georgians of General John Gordon's brigade and North Carolinians under General Junius Daniel in the fields and adjacent woods of the Higgerson Farm.           Proceed to Virtual Tour, Chewning Farm",
