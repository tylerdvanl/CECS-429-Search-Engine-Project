Under the ADA, service animals must be harnessed, leashed, or tethered, unless these devices interfere with the service animal's work or the individual's disability prevents using these devices. In that case, the individual must maintain control of the dog through voice, signal, or other effective controls. Dogs should also be housebroken.",
