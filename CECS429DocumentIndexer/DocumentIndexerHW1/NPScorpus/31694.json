Melvin Hartley   Â    Pets are allowed on trails at New River Gorge National River. The regulations that cover pets and their owners have been carefully developed to allow you to share your park experience with your pet while still protecting the native animals and other park resources, as well as other visitors. If you choose to bring your pet to New River Gorge please be prepared to follow the regulations.   Park pet policies: Please respect all visitors to parks and protect site resources by following these park pet policies.    Pets must be kept on a leash no longer than 6 feet at all times. Leashes protect pets from becoming lost, from hazardous wildlife encounters, and from scaring or threatening wildlife. Leashes also protect other visitors who may be afraid, allergic, or who do not want a pet approaching them.    Pick up your pet's excrement. It is unpleasant to encounter and degrades the park's ecosystem.    Bring extra water for your pet do drink on your hikes. Streams may contain bacteria or parasites such as Giardia that are harmful to you and your pet.    Do not bring pets to public ranger programs;this avoids potential conflicts with other animals and respects other program participants.",
