In celebration of the National Park Service's 100 Birthday, Lowell National Historical Park is Bringing the Park to the People. We will co-host a series of community outreach events at neighborhood parks. These events will include pop-up museums and neighborhood Lowell Walks tours co-hosted by Dick Howe and local residents. Made in Lowell's Trailer Chat will engage community members in conversations about what it means to be a \"Lowellian,\" and collect stories of the neighborhoods to share with the community.          One of the signature highlights of the series is the community weaving project, with community members invited to bring a strip of fabric from their home which represents who they are, their family, their culture or heritage. Participants will weave the fabric into a grid, alongside strips of fabric from their neighbors. Once each piece is finished, it will be combined with other pieces from throughout the City of Lowell. The community weaving project, with pieces from each of the neighborhoods in Lowell, will be on displayed at the Lowell National Historical Park Founder's Day event on Saturday August 27, 2016 at Boarding House Park. The project will be displayed at several venues in the city through 2017. The goal of the project is to display the rich history and diversity of the communities here in Lowell. Bring the Park to the People will then return to Lowell National Historical Park and Boarding House Park on Saturday August 27, 2016 to present a world premiere performance of music and dance created to tell the story of Lowell, a project in collaboration with the UMass Lowell Music Department, Angkor Dance Troupe and Flying Orb Productions.
