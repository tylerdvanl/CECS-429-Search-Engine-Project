Whom could he trust to hide his family or guard his possessions?  Robinson made many fateful decisions in the war years. After the war, Robinson found that his actions in this time of crisis would be judged with serious consequences for himself and his family. Had he proved himself a loyal Union man? Or had his dealings with local Confederates shown otherwise? In this unit, you will learn his story, re-create his hearing before the Southern Claims Commission and then take a stand.
