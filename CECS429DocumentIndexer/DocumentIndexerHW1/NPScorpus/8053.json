    "body": "Discovery Cabin         The Discovery Cabin is now called Apgar Nature Center NPS  Take a Break from the Trail Each summer from the end of June until Labor Day, the Apgar Nature Center is staffed by park rangers who help children explore the many items in the cabin. The cabin is located in Apgar Village, just a short walk from Apgar Visitor Center. At the cabin, children enjoy creating their own puppet shows, playing track twister, putting their hands into our mystery touch box, sorting rocks, horns, and antlers or stamping animals into their proper habitats. Check the Ranger-led Activity Schedule for a list of times the cabin will be open.         The stamp station in the Discovery Cabin helps you learn about all the different Glacier animals and where they live.   Practice the Discovery Cabin Song If you like to sing, you may want to try our Ballad of the Discovery Cabin. It's a fun one to hum while you are stamping your Glacier habitat masterpiece!           Don't peek!   Touch Box Mystery   The sense of touch is really important to many animals. How would you like to put your hand into our mystery box and try your sense of touch? Think you can solve the mystery of what's inside? (All of the items are natural objects from Glacier.)
