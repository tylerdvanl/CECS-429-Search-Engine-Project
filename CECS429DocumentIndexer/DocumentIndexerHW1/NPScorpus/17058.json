    "body": "A Presidential Retreat  From this distance the seat of national power appears pristine across the river, so President Johnson came here often when he needed to escape from the stresses of building a Great Society. After he died, his wife chose this place for his memorial. A landscape of serpentine paths, white pines, a granite monolith, and an open meadow honors his legacy of social justice and conservation legislation.              Trash Free Park   Keep our park clean! These interns and volunteers came out to clean up the park!",
