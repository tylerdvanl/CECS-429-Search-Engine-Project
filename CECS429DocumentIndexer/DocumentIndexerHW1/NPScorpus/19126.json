The cultural collections include: archeological materials systematically collected from within the Monument's boundaries and associated field reports; historic objects associated with the areas 19th and 20th century exploration, settlements and mining; archival and manuscript collections such as those associated with Robert Limbert; photographs; and scientific and resource management records. Cultural materials obtained from systematic surveys are housed at Idaho State University in Pocatello or in the Monument's museum storage facility along with items collected by Monument staff over the years. The natural history collections include: a herbarium of vascular and nonvascular plant species; geological specimens from throughout the Monument; some mammal and reptile specimens; and associated project documentation and reports. The park collections are described in greater detail in our Museum Management Plan and in our Scope of Collections documents.
