    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility             Accessibility       The Thomas Condon Paleontology Center is located in the Sheep Rock Unit of the monument, 9 miles west of Dayville, Oregon. The parking lot has a non-sloping paved approach to the center. Inside the center is a fossil museum, theater, education room, bookstore, restrooms, and drinking fountains, all of which are accessible to visitors. The park film is shown with captions on at all times although an audio description is not yet available. Touch exhibits including a wide variety of fossil replicas are available in the center. A wheelchair is available for loan at the center.  The James Cant Ranch Historic District is located a quarter mile from the Thomas Condon Paleontology Center, and is open most weekdays. The ranch house contains a cultural museum, restrooms, and a drinking fountain which are all accessible to visitors in wheelchairs.  Trails and Overlooks: Most of the park trails and overlooks are not considered accessible as they are surfaced with loose gravel, have dropoffs, or are steep. The Foree area of the Sheep Rock Unit has the ¼ mile Story in Stone Trail. It has a rough uneven asphalt surface with slopes that exceed ADA standards. Monument staff is reviewing project possibilities to create new ADA compliant trails.  At the Painted Hills Unit the ¼ mile Painted Cove Trail has 300 feet of boardwalk with some slope and an accessible parking area.  Picnicking: Picnic areas and tables, accessible to visitors in wheelchairs, are available at all three units of the monument.    Water and Restrooms: Accessible drinking fountains and restrooms are available at all three units of the monument. Outdoor water sources at picnic areas are turned off during colder months.",
