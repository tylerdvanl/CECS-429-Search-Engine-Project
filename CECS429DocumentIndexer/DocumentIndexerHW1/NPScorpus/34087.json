    "body": "Explore This Park    Learn About the Park     Nature     Environmental Factors     Air Quality                Air Quality       The area surrounding Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park has experienced a surge of growth in the past 15 years as a result of increased use of I-95 as a major north-south transportation corridor. This expansion has resulted in new industries, increased development, and traffic adjacent to the park. In 1992, Stafford County was listed as a \"non-attainment\" area under the Clean Air Act, suggesting serious air quality problems. Hydrocarbon pollution from three major areas, Washington, D.C.. Richmond, VA, and Fredericksburg metro areas, are potential contributors to the decline of air quality in the park. Air pollution may be causing yet undetermined impacts on the park's natural and cultural resources. The park was classified as a Class II park in the clean air act of 1977. This designation relates to the amount of air quality degradation that is allowable. This classification allows only moderate amounts of degradation of the existing air quality condition.",
