    "body": "Nonnative Species       One need not look far to find a non-native plant species within the park. Many of these plants were used as ornamentals or for erosion prevention and bank stabilization. Now they are invading our native woodlands and fields, and in some cases have reached problematic stages.  Efforts are currently underway to maintain control of the most threatening exotic species in areas of the park where the infestations can be managed. The park presently has an integrated pest management program for giant and Japanese knotweed, Japanese barberry, Japanese and exotic bush honeysuckles, multiflora rose and Asiatic bittersweet.",
