Our new Junior Ranger program is designed for children, ages 5-13, who can earn a Junior Ranger badge and certificate by completing activities contained within the Junior Ranger booklet. 16 activities take young visitors through exhibits and self-guided walks and tours throughout the park. Once kids complete the appropriate activities for their age group, rangers and park volunteers will issue their badge and certificate. Come by to get your Junior Ranger badge today!
