The Kabetogama Lake Ice Road travels between the boat launches of the Ash River and Kabetogama Lake Visitor Centers.  Routes vary depending on conditions The ice road is open to cars and trucks of less than 7,000 lbs. gross vehicle weight. Snowmobiles are not permitted on the ice road. The speed limit is 30 mph. When heavy snow, slush, or thin ice exists, the ice road may be closed or shortened for safety. Travel beyond the plowed section is unsafe. Safety on the ice roads  Ice Fishing Ghostly winter quiet, rugged piney shorelines, and outstanding angling make Voyageurs National Park an ice angler’s dream. Place icehouses at least 50-feet from the center of snowmobile trails and the ice road. Check ice conditions before going out. Fishing license and ice house registration is required.        A visitor snowmobiling across a land portage. NPS  Snowmobiling Snowmobiling is allowed on frozen lake surfaces and designated safety portages in Voyageurs National Park. The park provides 110 miles of staked and groomed trails for snowmobiling. All land areas, including rock faces, are closed to snowmobiles with the exception of designated safety portages. Hill climbing is prohibited. Obey all closure signs. Areas are closed to protect your safety and to protect sensitive resources.   Watch For:  Pressure ridges – they change the surface of the lake. Always stop and inspect ridge areas before crossing. Pressure ridges are marked with two crossed orange caution stakes on each side.   Slush and open water – avoid them by staying on staked and groomed trails.        Sledding Hill A new addition to our winter activities is the Sphunge Island-Kabetogama Lake Sledding Hill.  Take the Kabetogama-Ash River Ice Road from the Kabetogama Lake Visitor Center just a short distance and turn left onto the Sphunge Island Loop. Visitors will find picnic tables and a fire ring at the bottom of the hill near the sledding hill parking lot.  The sledding hill consists of a small hill for younger children and a larger hill for older children and adults.",
