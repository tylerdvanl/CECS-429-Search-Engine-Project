The museum collection represents a wide variety of periods and cultures, including pre-contact and post-contact indigenous peoples, the Hudson's Bay Company fur trade, the U.S. Army, early military and civilian aviation at Pearson Field, and the Kaiser Shipyards. Our curation facility currently houses over 2.5 million items! Approximately 90% of these objects come from archaeological excavations that have taken place on the site since 1947. Others were generously donated by individuals or groups in the local community. Collections from several other, related sites are also curated here, including collections from Fort Colvile in Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area, Fort Nez Perce in Whitman Mission National Historic Site, and San Juan Island National Historical Park, as well as collections from the Cathlapotle and Meier village sites. Once items are accepted into our museum collection, they are protected in a climate-controlled facility, where staff work tirelessly to preserve and interpret them for current and future generations. Management of Museum Collections at the Vancouver National Historic Reserve  At Fort Vancouver NHS, the National Park Service also curates collections from the City of Vancouver, the State of Washington, the National Park Service, and other entities represented within the Vancouver National Historic Reserve.  Prospective Donors Our Scope of Collections document guides acquisitions to the museum collection, and ensures that we can appropriately care for the items we do accept. We focus on items that have a direct historical association with this site (including the Hudson's Bay Company Fort Vancouver, Vancouver Barracks, Pearson Field, the Spruce Cut-Up Mill, and Kaiser Shipyards) or a strong connection to an individual who worked or lived here.
