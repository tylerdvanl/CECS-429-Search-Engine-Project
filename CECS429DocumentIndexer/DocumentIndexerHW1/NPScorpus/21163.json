For some reason, I ended up at the front of the line, about the fifth person. When we went up the courthouse steps, somehow I always got the baton in my stomach.

So that changed the dynamics of the movement, gave the movement some impetus and it probably set the stage where the local authorities finally realized that we have a problem here and it's not going' away because most of that time, the teachers that did have some fear, they lost their fear and that is probably perhaps why the movement succeeded here. The people who participated in it had lost that fear.   Click Here to Listen To This and Other Stories Being Told (Flash Required)",
