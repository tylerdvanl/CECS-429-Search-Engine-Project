NPS Photo by Michele Kuna   Â    Conashaugh View Trail in Pennsylvania and Upper Ridge Trail in New Jersey are open to horse riding. There are no horse rental liveries in the park; these trails are intended for those who have their own horses. Riders should be aware that these trails are also open to hiking. Hikers should be alert to riders; hikers must yield to riders. If horses approach, hikers should step off the trail and stand quietly until they pass. Bicycles and motorized vehicles are NOT permitted on these trails. More information about the Conashaugh View Trail in Pennsylvania More information about the Upper Ridge Trail in New Jersey",
