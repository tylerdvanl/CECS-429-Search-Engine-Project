NPS  The purpose of this project is to re-establish Bull Trout migration patterns to streams and lakes outside of Crater Lake National Park. The goal of this project is to improve Sun Creek habitat on the privately-held ranch land and re-establish flows to the Wood River so that Bull Trout migration patterns can be fully restored. The headwaters of Sun Creek are located within Crater Lake National Park, flow through Sun Pass State Forest (Oregon), onto privately-held ranch land, and then flows into the Wood River. The Wood River flows into the Klamath River via several lake systems.",
