We offer a wide range of cave tours for all levels of experience and expertise.  Want to make reservations for a ranger-guided tour? Self-guided tours do not require reservations but ranger-guided tours do. For reservations call 1.877.444.6777 or visit recreation.gov Need information on accessibility in the park? Our Accessibility Guide is available.  Why we ask you if you have visited another cave site recently?  White-nose Syndrome (WNS) is a disease affecting hibernating bats, named for the white fungus that appears on the muzzle and other parts of their bodies. WNS is associated with extensive mortality of bats in eastern North America. If you have visited another cave site recently and are wearing the same shoes and\/or clothing you will need to go through a cleaning process that will take just a few minutes before you enter the cave. Finding that you want more information before you arrive? Read \"Things to Know Before You Come\" section of this website as well as other links.  Still have a question that hasn't been answered? Email the park and ask a ranger at: cave_park_information@nps.gov or call 575-785-2232.
