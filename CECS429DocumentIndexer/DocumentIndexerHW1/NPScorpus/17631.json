    "body": "Wildland-Urban Interface          Â    The Wildland-Urban Interface is the area where homes and wildlands meet. A wildland fire in this zone could threaten public safety and many homes. Golden Gate National Recreation Area includes many wildland areas where flammable vegetation flourishes next to homes. Many San Mateo and Marin County neighborhoods border park land and are areas where fire is a concern. In 1991, the Oakland Hills Fire destroyed over three thousand homes. Forty-five homes were lost to the Vision Fire near Point Reyes in October of 1995. Unfettered vegetation buildup fueled these fires. Such losses emphasize the importance of the National Park Service addressing Wildland-Urban Interface issues. To address the hazards related to the Wildland-Urban Interface, Golden Gate National Recreation Area manages fuels surrounding the interface. Visit the Community Wildfire Protection Projects page to learn more about fuel management efforts.
