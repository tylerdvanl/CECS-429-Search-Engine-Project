    "body": "Birds         A wood duck is just one example of the 134 species you may see along the Natchez Trace Parkway.  NPS Image  Whether you are an avid birder, or new to the hobby, the Natchez Trace Parkway provides numerous opportunities to see and hear a variety of birds. Stop along any of our wooded nature trails, or near a stream or river to have your best chance of viewing a unique species. Several of our pull-offs are noted for their quality birding opportunities. For wading birds try the Ross Barnett Reservoir, Tenn-Tom Waterway, or Colbert Ferry. There you may spot a Great Blue Heron, Great Egret, or a Double-Crested Cormorant. For songbirds it is hard to beat the Rocky Springs, Jeff Busby, Witch Dance, Donivan Slough, and Meriwether Lewis nature trails. Deep in these woods you may hear or spy a Northern Cardinal, Cedar Waxwing, or Scarlet Tanager.   Don’t forget to listen for the hollow drumming of woodpeckers and sapsuckers tapping out a meal. For raptors the skies are big at Chickasaw Village, Pharr Mounds, Water Valley Overlook, and Birdsong Hollow. Bald Eagles, Red-Tailed Hawks, Mississippi Kites, and American Kestrels have been spotted. Check out our grasslands and experience the gorgeous blue of the Indigo Bunting, the never-ending song of the Whip-poor-will, or the whistled hoy of the Northern Bobwhite. Hundreds of people visit Rock Spring every fall to witness the Ruby-throated Hummingbirds feasting on jewelweed nectar. Featured on the North Alabama Birding Trail, both Rock Spring and Colbert Ferry provide excellent birding opportunities throughout the year. You do not have to leave the roadway to happen upon a few birding opportunities. Turkey, Canada Geese, vultures, and hawks are often visible while driving. Drive carefully and this resource will be enjoyed by many to come. Download the birding checklist and discover a few of the 134 confirmed species of birds found along the Natchez Trace Parkway.",
