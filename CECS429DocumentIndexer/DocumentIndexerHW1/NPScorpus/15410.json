The Superintendent has discretionary authority, under the provisions of 16 USC 3, and in accordance with the regulations and delegated authority provided in Title 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Chapter I, Parts 1-7, to establish regulatory provisions for the proper management, protection, and government and public use of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. The regulatory provisions, reviewed annually, are listed in the Compendium of Designations, Closures, Permit Requirements, and other Restrictions. Proposed regulations are reviewed for consistency with applicable legislation and federal administrative policies and are based upon a determination that such actions are necessary for the maintenance of public health and safety, aesthetic values, and to avoid conflicts among visitor use activities. The National Park Service amends park regulations to allow the “Fireworks on the Lakefront” event on July 2, 2013. Areas of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore affected by this event include the entire shoreline where the fireworks are visible: from approximately Dune Acres to the Dunbar parking lot. This includes the National Park Service parking lots at Wabash Avenue, East State Park Road (Kemil parking), and Dunbar. The entire length of this stretch of coastline is within Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. All areas from the Ordinary High Watermark and extending 300 feet into the lake are within Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore and under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service. Pursuant to 36 CFR §1.5 (a) (1), all areas of the national lakeshore along this coastline are closed to public use 30 minutes after sunset. National Park Service parking lots and restrooms are also closed at night and persons entering these areas during the closed periods are in violation of regulations and subject to citation or arrest.   In order to accommodate this fireworks event, the National Park Service will temporarily adjust the federal closure regulations. Accordingly, the following addendum is made to the 2013 Superintendent's Compendium.   I. 36 CFR §1.5 -VISITING HOURS, PUBLIC USE LIMITS, CLOSURES, AND AREA DESIGNATIONS FOR SPECIFIC USE OR ACTIVITIES   (a)  (1) The following visiting hours and public use limits are established for all or for the listed portions of the park, and the following closures are established for all or a portion of the park to all public use or to a certain use or activity:     Visiting Hours Addendum: ″ Commencing at 8:00 a.m. on July 2, 2013 and ending at 11:30 p.m. on July 2, 2013, the following areas are open to public use for observing the fireworks display: o  Wabash Avenue parking lots and restrooms o  Kemil access parking lots and restrooms o  Dunbar parking lot and restroom o  Lake View parking lot and restroom o  Beach below the toe of the dune and park waters from the west end of West Road in Dune Acres to Lake View   If the scheduled event is rained out and rescheduled, the open hours will not change on July 2, and the addendum is amended to apply to the hours between at 8:00 a.m. on July 5, 2013 and ending at 11:30 p.m. on July 5, 2013.   All other closures and use limits in the 2013 Superintendent's Compendium and 36 CFR remain unchanged. The public closure regulations remain in effect for all other areas of the park.      36 CFR Part 1-199 Parks, Forests, and Public Property 36 CFR contains the regulations \"for the proper use, management, government, and protection of persons, property, and natural and cultural resources within areas under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service.\" The regulations are \"utilized to fulfill the statutory purposes of units of the National Park System: to conserve scenery, natural and historic objects, and wildlife, and to provide for the enjoyment of those resources in a manner that will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\"         UNITED STATES CODE The United States Code is the codification by subject matter of the general and permanent laws of the United States. It is divided by broad subjects into 50 titles and published by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the U.S. House of Representatives.
