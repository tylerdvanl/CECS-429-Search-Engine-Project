Matt Johnson   Â    With 95% of its 173,000 acres covered by water, Biscayne National Park requires some planning to make the most of a visit. Being on or in, the water is the best way to experience the park. If you only have a short while and a boat is not available, the Convoy Point area offers a variety of land based and indoor opportunities to get to know the park. Check the park's calendar for other opportunities.",
