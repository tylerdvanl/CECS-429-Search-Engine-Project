Fencerow corridors, grassland habitat, open meadows, agricultural fields, riparian zones, and forest interiors are all different types of bird habitat that can be found within the park. In an inventory performed in 1999 & 2000 by Frostburg State University, avian species diversity and richness were studied at the battlefield. The results indicate that during the breeding season of 2000, eighty different species of birds were observed within the park. This study found that species richness and bird density was highest in riparian habitats, followed by fencerow habitat, then finally forest interior habitat. The structural diversity between all of the habitat types mentioned above make Monocacy a very interesting place for anyone who enjoys viewing birds. A list of species of birds seen at Monocacy National Battlefield is available.",
