NPS Photo  Mushrooms Whiskeytown is home to a wide variety of mushroom species, but a complete inventory has not yet been conducted.

Â      Turkey tail fungus (Trametes versicolor) is a common decay fungus in Whiskeytown. NPS Photo  Tree Diseases and Decay Fungi Native tree diseases and decay fungi are common in Whiskeytown. In 2005, Dr. Robert Mathiasen of Northern Arizona University conducted an extensive inventory of root, rust, and foliage diseases; blights; stem decays; mistletoes; and bacterial tree diseases as part of the Sabbatical in the Parks program. This inventory documented 21 native and 2 non-native disease species in the park.",
