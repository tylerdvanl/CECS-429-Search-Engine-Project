Oh my!                           Mammals, Amphibians, and Reptiles         Frog in a pond. NPS  Acadia contains a variety of natural habitats that provide homes for many different animal species. Our location on the coast and the diversity of habitats explains this species richness. The size of these habitats and their separation from other habitats or larger natural habitats, however, limits the types of animals that are found here. Small animals adapted to smaller habitats are therefore more common, unlike the large mammals such as black bears and moose that require large areas and are rarely observed.  The quieter and more patient you are, the greater your chances of finding and observing any animal, regardless of size. If you have any unusual wildlife sightings while you are exploring the park, please fill out a wildlife observation card at the visitor center, nature center, campgrounds, or park headquarters.

NPS  Bird List With a record of 338 bird species encountered, Acadia National Park is considered one of the premier bird-watching areas in the country. Twenty-three species of warblers alone have been recorded as breeding in the park! Click here for a checklist of the birds in the area.    HawkWatch Every year, strong northerly winds push thousands of raptors from Maine and Canada south along the eastern coastline as they migrate to warmer areas for the winter. With its wide-open views and tallest vantage point on the eastern coast, Acadia's HawkWatch location on Cadillac Mountain often provides visitors with a close look at the soaring raptors. Each year, program participants see large numbers of sharp-shinned hawks and American kestrels. To help you identify flying raptors, click here for a silhouette guide. Peregrine Falcons For information on their markings, and conservation efforts, click here.          Fish         Brook trout. NPS\/Bill Gawley  Historic records indicate that 31 fish species have been encountered in the lakes, ponds, and brooks of Acadia National Park, although only 28 species can be found today. Visit our fish checklist for more information.          Marine Invertebrates         Northern Seastar. NPS\/Sarah Hall  The intertidal zone of Acadia National Park contains numerous invertebrates (animals lacking a backbone).

NPS\/Todd Edgar  With diverse habitats from ocean shoreline to the granite tops of mountains, Acadia National Park contains many different types of insects. Just how many, we're not sure. From 1928 to 1944, William H. Procter studied the invertebrates in the park. Today, park staff protect his collection as part of the curatorial program. The park continues to learn about its insect species through the BioBlitz series, where biologists and naturalists conduct a rapid assessment of a specific group of invertebrates over a 24-hour period. These BioBlitzes document species occurrence, provide estimates of species richness, and identify rare and unique species.",
