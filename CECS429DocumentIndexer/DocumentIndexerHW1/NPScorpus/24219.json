The geological and paleontological resources that exist in the park provide glimpses into environments millions of years ago and some of the plant and animals that lived then. The Carnegie Fossil Quarry is world renowned and specimens from it are featured in museums across the globe. Today, the diversity of life in Dinosaur's rugged environment is a reflection of climate, geography, and the complexity of the landscape itself. The monument provides habitat for more than 1,000 native species of plants and animals and includes more than 200,000 acres of river canyons, mountains, and basins. Elevations range from under 4,750 feet (1,448 meters) near the Quarry to over 9,000 feet (2,743 meters) at Zenobia Peak. Twenty-three exposed geological strata combine with elevation and topography to create the many habitats that support plant and animal life.
