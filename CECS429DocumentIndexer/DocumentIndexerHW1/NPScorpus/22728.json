Depending on which segment you would like to explore, some or all of these activities may be available. Although the word \"trail\" is used in the name, the California NHT is not a true hiking trail. With 2,000 miles of the original route now in the hands of various private and public entities, access to trail segments depends upon the permission of the land owner. Some segments are open to the public for hiking and other means of recreation, while others are not. Following is a list of recommended pages for visiting for the California NHT. Inquiries about segments not listed are best made locally. For more information, see the Links and Resources, Places To Go, and the pages for the Auto Tour Route driving directions.  Â   Camping  The National Park Service does not offer any camping facilities along the trail. Inquire with local land managers (see Links and Resources page for contact information).
