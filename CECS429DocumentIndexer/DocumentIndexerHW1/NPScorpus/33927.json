    "body": "Embattled Capital, 1861 to 1865  Richmond's story is not just the tale of one large Civil War battle, nor even one important campaign. Instead, the park's resources include a naval battle, a key industrial complex, the Confederacy's largest hospital, dozens of miles of elaborate original fortifications, and the evocative spots where determined soldiers stood paces apart and fought with rifles, reaping a staggering human cost.              Richmond, Then and Now   Houses, fields and forests dot the land around Richmond where battles raged over 150 years ago.",
