The park contains important breeding habitat for a variety of species.  During a survey conducted in 1999-2000 by park volunteers, 49 different species were found nesting in the park.  The park’s many trails, fields, orchards and vistas provide opportunities for bird observation.  Large avian species such as Red-tailed Hawks and Pileated Woodpeckers are commonly seen in the park.  In 2002, a two-year National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring Program was initiated to inventory the bird species at Morristown NHP.  So far the presence of 67 bird species including 31 neotropoical migrants have been documented.  A number of extremely interesting species have been detected in the park including Yellow-bellied Sapsucker, Pileated as well as Hairy Woodpeckers, Yellow-throated Vireo, Seven species of thrushes (Eastern Bluebird, Wood Thrush, Gray-cheeked Thrush, Swainson's Thrush, Hermit Thrush, Veery, and American Robin), Cerulean Warbler, Louisiana Waterthrush, and Indigo Bunting.
