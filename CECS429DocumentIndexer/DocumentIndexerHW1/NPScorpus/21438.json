NPS Photo  Arctic sand dunes and vast herds of caribou aren't the only things that make Kobuk Valley National Park unique. The Kobuk locoweek, or Oxytropis kobukensis, is a small, flowring herb in the pea family that is only found in Kobuk Valley National Park. On average, it grows to a height of 30 cm and produces purple flowers during late June and July. It only lives on the sparsely vegetated dunes and slopes of the Great Kobuk Sand Dunes. Before traveling to the sand dunes, be sure to stop by the Northwest Arctic Heritage Center in Kotzebue so a park ranger can prep you on how to find the Kobuk locoweed.",
