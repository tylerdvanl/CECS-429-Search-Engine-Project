Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor is a region to be explored. The Corridor is not a traditional National Park, but rather one where people live, work and play. It is a living landscape where its long and nationally pivotal history is still visible through thousands of structures in distinctive landscapes and accessible through the living memory of its residents. To understand the Blackstone Valley you must “read the landscape”. The history of the Valley is revealed through its buildings and landscapes that together tell the story of America’s transition from an agrarian society to one of industry. Throughout the region, one can see and experience how this area developed along the river valley and hilltops. You can begin your exploration of the Corridor by stopping at one of our six Visitor Information Centers to get oriented in the Valley, or by visiting some of the Valley's cultural sites, historical sites or recreational areas. You can also attend one of our Interpretive Ranger programs, download a self-guided tour brochure, or see what activities our partners are offering.",
