Local students use their talents to create artwork centered around a yearly park-related theme. It's a celebration of the community and the park. All students in grades PreK-6 are invited to participate in the Kids Art Show. This year's activity is not a contest, but a participation event with all works of art to be displayed at the Rainy Lake Visitor Center. Students are welcome to bring family and friends to the visitor center during National Park Week to view their art. Children in kindergarten and first grade may create a birthday card in honor of the 100th Anniversary of the National Park Service. Children in second through sixth grade are invited to participate by creating a drawing and writing a short passage related to this year's theme: Find Your Park â€“Protect Your Park! National parks are important places that need to be protected and cared for so future generations can enjoy them for the next 100 years. Students are encouraged to draw a picture that illustrates how they can help protect their park and write a short passage to accompany their drawing.
