The Nugget Creek trailhead is located on the Kotsina Road. The Kotsina Road turn-off is at mile 14.5 of the McCarthy Rd, on the north side of the road. The Kotsina Road is NOT marked, so be sure to pay attention to the mile markers. After about 2 miles on the Kotsina Road, the trailhead for Nugget Creek Trail is on the right. Parking at the trailhead requires permission and a small fee from the Chitina Native Corporation. Sometimes the Kotsina Road can be extremely rough and cars with low clearance will not be able to drive on it. If this is the case, we recommend that you turn around and park your car along the McCarthy Road. Please be aware that this will add two miles to your hike. Cabin can be accessed by foot, horse, mountain bike, ATV (with a permit), or small airplane at a nearby gravel airstrip. Nugget Creek feeds into the Kuskulana River about 1\/4 mile downstream from the cabin. Sometimes this creek runs high and may be difficult to cross.
