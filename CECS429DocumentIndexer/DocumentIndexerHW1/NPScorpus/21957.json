Community programs are available in the summer at the Northwest Arctic Heritage Center. Topics include natural and cultural history of the preserve, local research, local crafts and childrenâ€™s activities. Schedules vary, so please call 907.442.3890 before your arrival to learn about upcoming programs. There are no developed facilities in Noatak National Preserve. Access in summer is by plane or boat. Winter access is by plane or snow machine. Summer hikes in the Brooks Mountain Range are popular, especially along ridgelines where walking is easier than on the lower level tundra. Rafting the 400- mile Noatak River is a great way to experience the preserve. Commercial businesses provide flights when the weather is good, but plan extra days to wait in case of bad weather.  Small planes may be chartered from Kotzebue or Bettles to land in the national preserve, or to fly over the area for a view of the mountains and wildlife.",
