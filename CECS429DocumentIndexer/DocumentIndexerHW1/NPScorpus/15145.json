Parkcaches can be physical or virtual (earthcaches).        Complete at least 6 of the 11 centennial parkcaches to earn a free commemorative carabiner.   Centennial Parkcaching Challenge Explore the park and celebrate Lassen Volcanic National Park's 100th anniversary with this summer parkcaching challenge. To participate:  Make sure you have a GPS device or a GPS-enabled mobile device with a geocaching app. Use the GPS coordinates in the challenge brochure (1 MB, PDF) to locate parkcaches along the park highway. Look for laminated answer keys attached to park structures or signs. Fill in the blanks in the brochure for each cache with the answer provided. Be sure to leave the answer key where you found it for future participants to use. Present your completed brochure to a park ranger to receive your free commemorative carabiner.  The parkcaches will be removed at the end of October or whenever snowfall necessitates their removal. Please note that these temporary caches are not listed on geocaching.com and do not have a GC waypoint number. For registered earthcaches in the park, visit geocaching.com.        Learn more about earthcaching at earthcaching.org.   Earthcaches in Lassen Volcanic Earthcaching enthusaists have created a number of virtual caches within the park. These caches require seekers to answer questions using information available at each cache. Although these caches are not maintained by the park, rangers are happy to assist you if possible. You can view a map of virtual caches within the park on geocaching.com or learn more about earthcaching at earthcache.org.      Find Your Park GeoTour To celebrate the National Park Service centennial, the NPS and Geocaching.com have created a curated list of parkcaches within national parks across the country. Although the tour does not currently include any parkcaches within Lassen Volcanic National Park, we encourage you check out the parkcaches in nearby Lava Beds National Monument or head further south to uncover caches at Santa Monica National Recreation Area.",
