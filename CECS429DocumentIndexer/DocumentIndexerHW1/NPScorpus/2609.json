As you are planning your trip to Grand Canyon National Park, you might want to use some of the following tips to reduce your carbon travel costs, saving money, too! Before You Leave   Plan your route to minimize carbon emissions, for example travel by train and public transport where possible.   Keep your vehicle's engine tuned and your tires properly inflated to get the best gas mileage and reduce the chances of expensive repair fees.   Minimize flying time and stopovers. Carbon emissions are extremely high during take off and landing.   If you are selecting a tour company, ask how they minimize environmental impacts and contribute to the local economy in order to support the greenest business practices.   To save money while you are gone, adjust your air conditioner and\/or heat to the lowest possible setting to still protect pets, plants, etc.   To save even more money, turn your hot water heater to \"Vacation\" or the lowest setting, or just turn off the breaker. This may save significant costs, even if only over a 3-day weekend!  Appliances, such as televisions and computers, can be unplugged because they can draw or \"leak\" as much as 40 watts per hour even when they are turned off, costing you money even when you are not there.   Put your newspaper delivery on hold and ask if the company will prorate your bill so that you don't pay for newspapers you don't receive.   Purchase electronic tickets for airline travel to reduce waste and cost. If paper tickets are lost, they may cost $75-100 to have replaced.        During Your Travels   If possible, walk whenever you can to save money, enjoy the landscape, and get some exercise after long periods of sitting while traveling. Many Ranger-led programs are a great way to get some exercise and to learn about Grand Canyon.   Use public transportation when available, such as the free shuttle service at Grand Canyon National Park. Let someone else do the driving while you're here!   For your safety in the dry climate of the Southwest, you should drink plenty of water. Carry a reusable water bottle with you, and refill as needed. Grand Canyon's water is some of the cleanest in the country!   A well packed picnic is not only healthy and more cost effective than eating out, it will reduce fast food waste going into landfills.    If you are a coffee drinker, many cafes and diners will fill a reusable cup that you bring with you. Some might even give you a small discount! This allows you to get your coffee and head out to enjoy the canyon, while still keeping your drink piping hot.   Water is a limited resource throughout the Southwest. Reduce the amount of water you use for bathing or showering. At hotels, let management know that it's not necessary to change your sheets and towels every day. This reduces water and electricity use and saves everyone money!   Don't forget the good habits you already have at home. When you leave your hotel room, turn off the air conditioner\/heat, lights, television, and radio.   Participate in recycling programs by placing recyclables in appropriate bins. Grand Canyon collects all plastics, cardboard, aluminum, and paper for recycling.   Take only brochures or maps that you need. Keep your Grand Canyon GUIDE with you so that you do not need multiple copies.        Would you like to actually calculate your carbon emissions at home and during your travels? This can give you an idea of just how much money you can save when you travel green!  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Household Emissions Calculator allows you to determine your overall household emissions.  The Do Your Part Calculator allows you to determine carbon emissions for transportation and your household.  Try doing an on-line search for other carbon calculators that meet your specific needs!        Return to The Greening of Grand Canyon.
