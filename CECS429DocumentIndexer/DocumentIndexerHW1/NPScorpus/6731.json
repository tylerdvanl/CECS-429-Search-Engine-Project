NPS photo  While walking the trail at BolivarHeights, visitors can observe eastern tiger swallowtails (Papilio glaucus) and zebra swallowtails (Eurytides marcellus marcellus) dipping along the forest edge. Following this trail back to the Union Skirmish Line, meadow fritillaries (Boloria bellona bellona), silver-spotted skippers (Epargyreus clarus), and monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) are just a few of the species that can be spotted feeding in the open field.   Approximately 140 insect species, including spiders, butterflies, ticks, mites, millipedes and centipedes, have been identified in the park. Currently, the park is conducting three separate insect surveys. Butterfly (Lepidoptera), dragonfly and damselfly (Odonata), and aquatic insect (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, etc.) populations within the park are being inventoried at this time. Results of each of these studies will be made available upon their completion.",
