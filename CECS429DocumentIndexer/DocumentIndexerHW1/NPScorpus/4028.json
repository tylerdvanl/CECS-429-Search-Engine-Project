NPS photo       In recognition of its outstanding universal values, Everglades National Park was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1979, during the 3rd session of the World Heritage Committee. Several natural resources criteria were emphasized in the inscription, including the unique geological processes of the limestone substrate, the juxtaposition of temperate and subtropical species and habitats, the complexity and integrity of biological processes in the park, the large number of bird and reptile species, and the unique threatened species that reside in the ecosystem, including the Florida panther, Everglades snail kite, American alligator and American crocodile, and the West Indian manatee. Reports are regularly compiled in response to reporting requirements of the World Heritage Committee. For this reason, two important dates are highlighted in a number of analyses: 1979 when Everglades National Park was designated a World Heritage Site, and 1993 when the park was placed on the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger. The reports are intended to consolidate information—on the progress of Everglades Restoration projects, and on the status of ecological indicators of site integrity—which may be utilized in decision-making regarding the status of the park as a World Heritage site. In addition, the content of the reports is intended to be broadly applicable and can assist park managers in the future to gauge the overall response of the Everglades ecosystem to factors such as changes in water operations, climatic variations, and implementation of large-scale Everglades restoration projects.      Available for Download          Everglades National Park: 2015 State of Conservation (PDF, 2.7 MB)          Everglades National Park: 2013 State of Conservation (PDF, 8.5 MB)          Everglades National Park: 2013 Indicators of Integrity (PDF, 13 MB)",
