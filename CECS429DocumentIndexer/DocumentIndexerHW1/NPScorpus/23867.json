    "body": "Laws & Policies       Firearms at Petroglyph National Monument People who can legally possess firearms under federal and state law can now possess those firearms in the national parks of that state. This includes Petroglyph National Monument. The new law (Sec. 512 of P.L. 111-24) was passed by Congress and signed last May by the President. State and local firearms laws vary. It is the responsibility of visitors to understand and comply with all applicable state, local, and federal firearms laws before entering this park. For New Mexico State law requirements see the New Mexico Department of Public Safety website. Federal law continues to prohibit the possession of firearms in designated “federal facilities” which include visitor centers, offices and office buildings, and maintenance buildings. These places are posted with “firearms prohibited” signs at public entrances. The new law also does not change prohibitions on the use of firearms in national parks and does not change hunting regulations.      Cooperative Management Agreement The National Park Service and the City of Albuquerque have finalized this agreement.
