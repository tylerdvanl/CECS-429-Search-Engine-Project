The “Scout Ranger” Program is designed to spark curiosity and interest in conserving our natural and cultural resources, increase Scout visitation to national park sites, promote environmental science and conservation career exploration, and empower Scouts to protect our national park sites through volunteer service. Scouts can earn Scout Ranger certificates and\/or patches for participating in projects like joining a park ranger on a nature walk or helping out a park by removing invasive plants to protect the native species. The opportunities to learn through these projects are endless!         To participate in the Ranger Scout Program please contact the Volunteer Office at 702-293-8714 or e-mail lake_volunteer_coordinator@nps.gov.",
