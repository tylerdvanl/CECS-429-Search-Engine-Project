For most people, Alaska is far away. To actually put your feet on the ground in the monument, you have to charter a 4-seater airplane or a boat to get there. However, rangers still need help from people who love their national parks. Caring about and contributing to public lands is an American ideal. Here is how you can help from near or far.   Volunteer There are many opportunities to support the work at Cape Krusenstern National Monument whether you live in the area or around the globe. See our volunteer page for more details. Donations You can make a gift to benefit the monument either directly to the National Park Service or through our cooperating association, Alaska Geographic. To make a gift directly to the National Park Service donation account, mail your check to the headquarters address.",
