NPS Photo by Steven Lonergan       Amanda Garvin was a single 35-year old woman when she bought this property in 1870 for $90.00. She had this cottage built by 1872. The Garvin house is a wonderful example of the Gothic Revival style with its steeply pitched roof, gingerbread bargeboard trim, and ornamental arches framing the open front porch. By 1878, Miss Garvin was renting her cottage to tenants. During the fifteen years she owned the property, she mortgaged it several times but lost the home to foreclosure in 1885.             American Gothic in West Branch     The cream-colored Garvin house is a wonderful example of the Gothic Revival style.
