However, there are no restaurants or lodging facilities within Redwood National and State Parks boundaries.     Towns like Crescent City,  Klamath and Orick are adjacent to the park - and they have plenty to offer.  Within an hour's drive of the park are other towns like Grants Pass, Trinidad, McKinleyville, Arcata and Eureka.    Plenty of private, public and state lands offer camping options in the area too.   Contact the local chambers of commerce and visitor bureaus for information about lodging and dining in communities around the parks.   There are camping options inside the park boundary.",
