    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information             Basic Information         Visit the Gila Visitor museum to see this miniature Mogollon mug and other artifacts found in the cliff dwellings by archaeologists. NPS Photo  Tread lightly, please   The trail from the mouth of Cliff Dweller Canyon up to the Gila Cliff Dwellings follows a stream, up the steep, rocky slope along the cliff side and into three of the six caves. This was once home to a Tularosa Mogollon community.  The one-mile trail will let you explore the natural environment that sustained the people, discover the caves carved over time by nature and through original rooms with timber lintels and support beams still intact.  Please...  Stay on the trail for your own safety and to help protect these fragile resources. Do not have food or drink other than water.  Take nothing but photographs. Do not touch the walls in any way.  There is even more to see and do at Gila Cliff Dwellings, including a trailhead museum with displays sharing the history of the area, museum exhibits with artifacts at the visitor center, and a 15-minute video.   Make the most out of your visit by checking out when we're open, how to get here, interpretive programs and special events, weather, and pet regulations.                   Physical Address           Milemarker 43 New Mexico Highway 15-43 mile north of Silver CitySilver   Silver City, NM 88061                 Directions         Regular passenger vehicles can drive 43 miles north of Silver City New Mexico on NM Highway 15.
