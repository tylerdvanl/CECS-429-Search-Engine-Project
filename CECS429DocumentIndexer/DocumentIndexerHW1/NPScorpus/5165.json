NPS Image   Â    The Middle Delaware National Scenic and Recreational River offers some of the best and most accessible water recreation opportunities in the northeast United States. This part of the Delaware River is relatively unspoiled as it travels through the rural landscape. Lots of quite pools and a few short riffles make this section ideal for beginning paddlers and those seeking a relaxing trip. Free shuttle service is provided on summer weekends by the Monroe County Transit Authority for those who bring their own canoe or kayak. Several authorized liveries rent canoes, kayaks, and rafts. Rental includes transportation, basic river orientation, paddles and life jackets.
