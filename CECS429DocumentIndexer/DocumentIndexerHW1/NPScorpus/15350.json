NPS Photograph.  Our Land Defines The Nez Perce Way Nez Perce Tribe  The Nez Perce homeland is filled with unique and special places that since the beginning of time have defined who they are. As you drive through the unique topography of Nez Perce country, keep in mind that many of the prominent landmarks you see more than likely have a story attached to them. Nez Perce National Historical Park interprets three of these story sites: Ant and Yellowjacket, Coyote's Fishnet and the Heart of the Monster. Each of these sites involves Coyote, who makes an appearance in many Nez Perce stories in a variety of different forms. To learn more about the stories of these special places, you can print off versions of the stories here. Ant and Yellowjacket and Coyote's Fishnet are on Hwy 95, very close to the park's visitor center in Spalding, Idaho. Heart of the Monster is located approximately 55 miles east of the visitor center on Hwy 12 just outside of the town of Kamiah.",
