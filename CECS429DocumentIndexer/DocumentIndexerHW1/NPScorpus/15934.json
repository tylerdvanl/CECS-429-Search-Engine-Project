Because Mojave is not near large population centers, most volunteers stay for two to three months or longer. Opportunities for local and weekend applicants are available in Barstow and Baker, California. Typical volunteer positions include:  Working as campground hosts. Staffing visitor center information desks, writing articles and taking photos for newspapers and brochures. Assisting in routine repairs and upkeep to buildings, utilities, and trails. Assisting with wildlife camera monitoring projects, spring surveys, cultural resource assessments, exotic weed identification and removal, litter removal, installing wilderness boundary markers, and documenting backcountry campsite locations.  Housing options for volunteers working 30 hours (typically four days-per week):  Dry, partial hook-up, or full hook-up campsites. The park pays propane costs for campers in dry or partial hook-up campsites. Shared co-ed housing in a dormitory or shared house is sometimes available.  Uniforms Shirts, jackets, and hats provided. Reimbursements $5 per day out-of-pocket reimbursement (tax-free), plus incentive awards based on the number of volunteer hours donated. Living at Mojave Traveling to town for groceries or medical appointments is a two to three hour round-trip journey. There are no stores, gas stations, motels, or other services in the park. But for those able to make that commitment, we offer wide open spaces, few signs of civilization, friendly park staff, spectacular night skies often filled with coyote song, and a variety of work that will keep you busy and fulfilled.
