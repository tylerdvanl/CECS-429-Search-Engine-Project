The eyrie produced two chicks that successfully fledged (permanently left the eyrie) the first week of August, before migrating south for the winter.Since the chicks fledged, winter's icy grasp on the Yukon River landscape has come and gone. Normally, you could enjoy a rare, beautiful view from high above the Yukon River, but this spring's break-up pushed ice high onto the shoreline, destroying the site of the data repeater. The repeater was an essential link for transmitting the image at the nest to the rest of the world. When the ice retreats, we will attempt to reestablish this vital link.For now, please enjoy the photos below of last year's peregrine nestlings in the eyrie.Webcam is currently inactive.

This means the image only refreshes every 30 seconds or so, and sometimes refuses to load altogether. Manually refreshing the page a time or two often results in the image loading correctly.      For more information, visit our webpage on peregrine falcons.      Sample Camera Views  Below are some sample screen captures of the peregrine falcon nestlings at various places on the eyrie.",
