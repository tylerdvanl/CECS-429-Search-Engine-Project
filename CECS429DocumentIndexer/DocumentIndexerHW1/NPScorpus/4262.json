MDC  BISCAYNE EXPLORER: WILDLIFE INVENTORY AND NATURE STUDY Biscayne Explorer: Wildlife Inventory and Nature Study is a standards-based, ranger-led program that brings the practice of science to life. This program offers students the opportunity to perform some of the same tasks park scientists perform, including water quality testing, seining and inventorying wildlife. Species identification and surveying are critical responsibilities that help to ensure proper management of natural resources.  Upon your arrival to the Dante Fascell Visitor Center, your class will be greeted by a National Park ranger who will provide your group with a brief orientation. The Ranger will then lead your class along activity stations. (Large groups may need teachers and chaperones to lead, as well as the park ranger.) Students will test water samples to learn about the impact of human actions on Biscayne Bay. Students will also take a nature walk to explore the inter-dependency of the park's resources. Lastly, students will identify and classify organisms brought up by rangers seining in Biscayne Bay's seagrass meadows.
