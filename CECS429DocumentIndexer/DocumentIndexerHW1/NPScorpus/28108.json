Authorized by the Volunteers in the Parks Act of 1969, the National Park Service can accept and use voluntary assistance from the public, in a way that is mutually beneficial to the Service and the volunteer. Each year more than 120,000 volunteers donate over 4 million hours of service at National Park Service sites nationwide. At Badlands alone, volunteers contribute 10,000 service hours annually, valued at $195,000. Badlands National Park advertises its most pressing volunteer opportunities on Volunteer.gov, a multi-agency website that provides one-stop “shopping” for volunteer opportunities.
