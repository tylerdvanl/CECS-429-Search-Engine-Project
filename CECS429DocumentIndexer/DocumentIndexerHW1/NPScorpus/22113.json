That means plant and animal life arrived very infrequently and then evolved in isolation from the rest of the world. For this reason, many of Hawaii's plants have evolved to be endemic (native to Hawaii).   Arriving sporadically as seeds or spores attached to migrating birds or insects caught in high winds, these early plants flourished with little to no opposition in Hawaii, and evolved to reflect this. With no grazing animals on the islands, plants in Hawaii needed no defense mechanisms. That's why Hawaiian holly is spineless, and Hawaiian nettles don't sting. Hawaiian mint is tasteless, where normally a strong taste fends off potential grazers.  Once Polynesians and later Europeans arrived on the islands, they cleared forests and introduced non-indigenous plants and animals, leading to the extinction of many endemic plants.         The Bishop Museum's Ethnobotany Database   Take a look at the Bishop Museum's online ethnobotany database to learn all about plant life in Hawaii and how plants have been used for medicine and\/or other purposes.         Flora of the Hawaiian Islands The Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History has a database all about the flora of the Hawaiian Islands.          Images of Hawaiian plants This is a database of images of plants that can be found here in Hawai'i.           Plant threats to Pacific ecosystem  Curious to know what plants are threatening the Pacific ecosystem? This database will show you.          Native Hawaiian Plants This database talks all about Hawaii's native, or endemic, plants, and fully describes the plant characteristics, flower characteristics, growth requirements, and environmental information.",
