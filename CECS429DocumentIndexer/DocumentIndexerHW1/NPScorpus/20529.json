NPS Photo     The landscape of Weir Farm with its rocky outcroppings, woodlands, fields, stone walls, and 18th & 19th century buildings has inspired artists since 1882 when Julian Alden Weir first acquired the property. Artistic inspiration continues today with the Artist-in-Residence and Take Part in Art programs, Impressionist Painting Workshops, and informal artistic expression by individuals or groups.   Master artist and instructor Dmitri Wright started teaching weekend Impressionist Painting workshops seven years ago. Working closely with the park, he established the Weir Farm Art Academy in 2014, an intensive and immersive week-long program for artist of all levels.  Here we enjoy the unique works of Dmitri and his students, each creation preserving and advancing the American Impressionist tradition and the landscape of Weir Farm.   Featured artists: Carole Ackerman, Constanza Baiocco, Terri Cuddy, Dee DeBernardis, Sherri Gregoire, Ginger Jespersen, Bonnie Johnson, Joan Kendall, Ann Kromer, Bobbie Eike Mullen, Day Shields, Denise Susalka, Eileen Tavolacci, Dmitri Wright.     The exhibition is open Wednesdays through Sundays from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm through October 2016 in the park’s visitor center at 735 Nod Hill Road, Wilton, CT 06897.",
