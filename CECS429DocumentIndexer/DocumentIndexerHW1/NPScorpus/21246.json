Here is a list of outreach events that Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument and the Post to Parks team have recently conducted off-site. We also partner with numerous veteran\/military support non-profits, veterans groups, Ft Carson, USAFA, Schriever AFS, Cheyenne Mountain AFS, and Peterson AFB units to engage and connect veterans, active duty, and military families with our national park.   The name \"Post to Parks\" commemorates the close and special relationship that the military and the National Park Service have shared since the late 1800's when the National Park Service was not yet created and U. S. Army rangers protected Yellowstone, Sequoia, and Yosemite National Parks. Today's Post to Parks program aims to continue to grow this relationship and invites new generations of military families to enjoy and take part in the protection of our nation's parks.   Goals: 1.)To use existing National Park Service programs such as Junior Ranger, Teacher Ranger Teacher, Let's Move Outside, Interagency pass, Volunteers in the Parks, curriculum based education, etc. to engage and promote connections between military families and the parks. 2.)To support existing military programs such as Wounded Warriors, Operation Guardian, and Operation Warfighter by providing places where soldiers can learn new skills, benefit from the healing powers of nature, and perhaps even find places of employment. 3.)To partner with other agencies, non-profits, for profits, individuals, civic organizations that support military families and youth to build capacity for the program. Post to Parks was developed and piloted at Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument              For more information about Post to Parks, please call 719-748-3253",
