However, even if you are an avid hiker, hiking the Grand Canyon is very different from most other hiking experiences. Mental attitude and adequate water and food consumption are absolutely essential to the success of any Grand Canyon hike, particularly in summer. The day hiker and the overnight backpacker must be equally prepared for the lack of water, extreme heat and cold, and isolation characteristic of the Grand Canyon.         Hiking in the Grand Canyon is so demanding that even people in excellent condition often emerge sore and fatigued. Yet small children, senior citizens, and people with physical disabilities have successfully hiked the canyon. A hike into the Grand Canyon will test your physical and mental endurance. Know and respect your limitations. Moderation is the key to an enjoyable hike.      Depending on how prepared you are, your trip can be a vacation or a challenge, a revelation or an ordeal.      Backcountry Audio Podcasts  Seasonal updates by Backcountry Information Center staff covering conditions in the Grand Canyon backcountry.
