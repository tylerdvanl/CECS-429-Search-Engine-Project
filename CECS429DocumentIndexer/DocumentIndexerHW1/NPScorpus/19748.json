Not only is the Chattahoochee River an important and renewable source of drinking water, the living organisms in the Gulf of Mexico depend on it. The course of the Chattahoochee River, begins in the northeast Georgia, and travels 542 miles downstream, to the Apalachicola Bay, Florida. Where the river meets the sea, an estuary exists. This estuary is a breeding ground and a nursery for fish and shellfish. Here the mixture of fresh water and salt water, and water temperature must be just right for spawning. Currently, Apalachicola Bay is one of the most productive fisheries in the United-States supporting a multi-million dollar sea food business. Water quality problems are all man made. With education, legislation and stewardship, the river can return to its original grandeur. We depend on its water for our life and the river depends on us for its protection.",
