Natural areas alert us to biological, chemical, and environmental changes that can affect our quality of life and the survival of species. Detecting these changes, such as air quality or non-native species, in the environment is an important part of Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Areaâ€™s mission. Various projects and studies are occurring across the Recreation Area to mitigate the effects of climate change and observe the corresponding shifts in plant and animal behavior.",
