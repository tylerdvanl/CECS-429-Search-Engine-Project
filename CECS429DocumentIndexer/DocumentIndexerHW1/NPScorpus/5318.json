It was fascinating and exciting... The beach was beautiful and had maybe a handful of people on it!\" Click the photo to read more. NPS PHOTO  Everyone is a part of history History includes much more than the stories of the famous. Every day, the decisions and actions of \"ordinary\" people help to shape history as we know it. In this section, you will find brief biographies of several people who are famous or were once famous in their day: aviators, military figures and social activists who were important to the history of Gateway or who had sections of the park named after them. You will also find dozens of oral histories from artillery soldiers, lighthouse keepers and lifesavers, civilian workers, spouses and children. Together, these stories help us understand what happened in the past and how we influence events today, events that will themselves pass into history. Jamaica Bay People includes aviators at Floyd Bennett Field, military figures at former Navy, Army and Coast Guard facilities and New York City figures who helped literally shape the park now known as Gateway.  Sandy Hook People includes not only the well-known figures in its history but also the Sandy Hook Oral History Project. This project focuses primarily on the occupants and work force at the former Fort Hancock: soldiers, spouses, children and civilian workers.",
