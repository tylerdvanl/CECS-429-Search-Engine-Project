Roanhorse 23 May, 2014.       Due of its high elevation climate, weather at Bryce Canyon through autumn, winter, and spring can be highly variable. Snowstorms in October are not unusual, yet there are also many sunny and pleasant autumn days during the month. From October to May temperatures fall below freezing nearly every night. The park typically experiences its coldest and snowiest periods from December through February. Spring storms in March and April can still produce heavy snowfall that may impact travel in the region. In summer the days tend to be pleasant, with daytime highs in June typically in the high 60s to low 70s (F), high 70s to low 80s in July and August, while September is similar to June. The rainy season occurs in July and August with frequent, usually brief, afternoon thunderstorms which produce heavy rain and frequent lightning. If visiting during these months remember that lightning kills and \"when thunder roars go indoors!\"  For the current National Weather Service forecast for Bryce Canyon click here (opens in new window).                Lightning Safety Lightning is a year-round danger –especially during summer storms! When thunder roars, go indoors. Lightning is within 10 miles (16 km) and you need to seek the shelter of a building or your vehicle immediately.
