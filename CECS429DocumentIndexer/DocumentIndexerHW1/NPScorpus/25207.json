    "body": "Hiking & Backpacking       While there are no formal trails within Aniakchak National Monument & Preserve, hikers and backpackers will find excellent hiking conditions atop the ash and cinder fields of the caldera floor. Because the Aniakchak landscape also features swift, cold rivers and seemingly impenetrable patches of dense vegetation, the path of least resistance will often be an animal trail. Be sure to make noise as you walk in these conditions to warn wildlife of your approach.",
