Downloadable copy of the Compendium (PDF-2.23MB).  Firearms in National Parks The law governing possession of firearms inside a national park changed on February 22, 2010. Visitors may possess firearms within a national park unit provided they comply with federal, state, and local laws. The role of the responsible gun owner is to know and obey the federal, state, and local laws appropriate to the park they are visiting. For more information about New York gun laws please visit their website. (At bottom of page click on \"Laws of New York\" and then search \"firearms\" the links will take you to the statues.) Please remember that federal law prohibits firearms in certain park facilities and buildings. These places are marked with signs at public entrances. Permits A Special Use Permit is required for any activity that provides a benefit to an individual, group, or organization rather than the park or the public at large. Many of the events that require permits also require some degree of oversight from National Park Service staff. Permit information",
