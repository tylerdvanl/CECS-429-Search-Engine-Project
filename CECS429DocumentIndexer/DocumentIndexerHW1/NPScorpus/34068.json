I found the internship to be a truly rewarding experience - I gained confidence in public speaking and research, really enjoyed creating walking tours and sharing my insights with the public... Living and working on the battlefields also gave me a greater appreciation for the individual soldiers who fought in the conflict.\"   - Andy Mach, Historical Interpreter Intern, 2009    Some roles of an Historical Interpreter include:  Answer questions about the park's location and points of interest Assist visitors with ancestor research and with general Civil War questions Develop and conduct their own battlefield walking tours  Interns are generally assigned to work two or three duty stations, depending on the season.
