Follow up the experience by building on student observations during the trip. Discuss what they saw and what they learned. Use their new knowledge in future lesson plans.   Discuss students trip impressions. What were their favorite parts of the trip? What didn’t they enjoy? Discuss improvements for future trips. Keep a list of these suggestions for reference.   Share the experience with others. Have students present trip reports to classmates. Create a bulletin board with photos and trip highlights. Give awards at an assembly to recognize student efforts (best hiker, best cook, most helpful, etc.).   Give thanks! Remember to thank parents and chaperones for their help. Praise students for successfully meeting mental and physical challenges. Acknowledge collective and individual rewards that come from outdoor adventures. And pat yourself on the back for a trip well done!",
