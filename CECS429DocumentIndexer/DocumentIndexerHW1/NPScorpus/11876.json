Pollutants such as motor oil, pesticides, fertilizers, pet waste and trash contaminate our local streams, beaches and ocean. When it rains, when we over water our lawns, or wash our cars in the driveway, the run-off picks up pollutants (from streets, parking lots, golf courses, homes and yards) and carries it into nearby storm drains. Urban run-off dumps polluted water into storm drains which lead directly into nearby streams. The polluted water then flows through the mountains and eventually dumps trash and pollutants into the ocean. Bacteria and urban pollutants can endanger human health, leading to the closure of beaches and trash that makes it to the ocean can be eaten by marine animals and entangle around their fins and necks. It doesn’t matter how far you live from the ocean, simple changes you make at home and in your community can reduce stream and beach pollution.
