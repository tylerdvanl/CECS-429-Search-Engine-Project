This can be challenging for many visitors. If you feel this climb may be a challenge for you, please call a park ranger from either of two phones.  One is located adjacent to the accessible parking spaces the second is located on the wall outside of the restroom facilities near the lake.  The ranger will either be able to provide a shuttle from the restrooms or will make other accommodations. Due to the nature of the park's location on mountainous terrain, visitors will encounter changes in grade, uneven pathways and gravel paths.
