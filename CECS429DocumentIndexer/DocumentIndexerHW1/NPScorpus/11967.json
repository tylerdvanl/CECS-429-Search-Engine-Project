The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area map and brochure includes the Backbone Trail itself and shows roads and parking throughout the area. The Backbone Trail map (672kb) shows roads, trailheads, water, and bathrooms along the trail. It also shows which areas of the trail are open for mountain bikers and which areas of the trail you can have your dog with you. Both of these are free maps.       Click on the picture of the map to get the Backbone Trail brochure and guide.      For detailed topographic information, purchase the four Tom Harrison maps:  Pt. Mugu State Park Zuma-Trancas Canyon Malibu Creek State Park Topanga State Park   The Trails Illustrated Santa Monica Mountains Map is less detailed, but covers the entire Santa Monica Mountains in one map (half on each side).
