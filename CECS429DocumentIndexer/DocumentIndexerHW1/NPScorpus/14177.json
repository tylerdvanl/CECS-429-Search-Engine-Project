    "body": "Cooperative Research       Many people, institutions, and agencies are researching the history of El Camino Real de los Tejas. Through the Challenge Cost Share Program, the National Park Service forms partnerships with many different groups to encourage research activities along the trail. Our collective goal is to to protect, preserve, and commemorate the history and properties associated with El Camino Real de los Tejas. A broad range of research topics are eligible for cost share funding. They could include: documenting a structure’s history and architectural fabric and design in anticipation of stabilization or preservation actions; studies of trail sites that may be eligible for certification or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places; general research into the trail’s history in a particular area that will contribute to an interpretive program there; and many others.      As part of research that contributed to the draft Comprehensive Management Plan (CMP) for El Camino de los Tejas National Historic Trail (published in July 2010), NPS staff prepared a bibliography on the history of the trail for the states of Louisiana and Texas. They were assisted by historian George Avery and archeologist Deidre Morgan-Remley. The following link shows this unedited historical bibliography:  El Camino Real de los Tejas Bibliography, July 2008 (116 KB Excel) The most readily available sources are found at the following bibliography February 18, 2011.      Go to the trailwide link below to access one completed research project.
