    "body": "A Wilderness of Stone and Water  It is an irresistible playground where unruly rapids check your skills as a canyon wren’s definitive call cascades down ancient limestone cliffs. Below the chasm, the canyon’s raw beauty dances across mirrored water. While the primal nature of the river stirs hunger for spirited adventure, the river is also an undulant ribbon of wetland corridor and, against all odds, the lifeblood of the desert.              Know Before You Go   Plan ahead and \"know before you go\" - this will increase your likelihood of a successful float trip on the Rio Grande.",
