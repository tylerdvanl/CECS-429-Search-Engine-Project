Mount Baldy is moving at about 4 feet a year. Beach sand moves when the prevailing northwest wind exceeds 7 m.p.h. Mount Baldy is 'starving'. Beach erosion is taking away more sand than the waves are bringing in due to the breakwall that was built for the Michigan City Harbor. To try and correct the effect of the breakwall the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began feeding the beach in 1974. Thus far they have given it four meals:   1974 fine sand trucked in. 1983 coarse sand trucked in. 1996 early summer 35,000 cubic yards slurried in by pipe from the harbor. 1996 late summer 50,000 cubic yards trucked in.",
