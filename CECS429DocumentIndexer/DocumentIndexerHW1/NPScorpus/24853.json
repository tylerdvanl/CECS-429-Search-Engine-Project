The NPS imposes no operating hours or seasonal restrictions. Access to and movement within the Alagnak Wild River corridor, however, may be limited or restricted at any time depending upon prevailing weather conditions. Please also be aware that while the NPS manages the river, in-holdings of private property exist along the shores of the Alagnak. At no time is it permissible to enter private lands without prior consent from the landowner. Please respect the rights of property owners and avoid illegal trespassing.",
