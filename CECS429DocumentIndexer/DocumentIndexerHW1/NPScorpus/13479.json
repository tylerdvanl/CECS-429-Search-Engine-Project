It describes interpretive media and programming, access, and resource protection completed or in development that are making the Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail visible and accessible to the public. The National Park Service is working closely with the trail's Advisory Council and national, state and local public and private organizations over the 2013-2015 War of 1812 bicentennial period to integrate our efforts, leverage each others' investments, and promote our projects and programs in ways that capitalize on bicentennial publicity and funding to raise the visibility of the trail and sustain meaningful learning and recreation experiences over the long term. The following \"State of the Trail\" report is organized around four key strategies: Connect people to trail experiences Improve access to the trail Conserve landscapes supporting visitor experiences Build and sustain collaborative partnerships for the trail In addition to describing our collective accomplishments, this report also identifies near-term opportunities for the NPS, the Advisory Council, and partners to continue to provide interpretation and protect resources over the next two years.
