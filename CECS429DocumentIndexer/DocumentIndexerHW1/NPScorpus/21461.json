NPS\/Patrick Myers  Zapata Falls This popular short hike is located on BLM (US Bureau of Land Management) land south of the national park, off of Highway 150. It is a good option for summer afternoons when sand surface temperatures are high. Simply driving to the trailhead provides an excellent view of the entire dunefield and San Luis Valley. However, the hike to the falls requires wading over slippery rocks into a rock crevasse. From the Visitor Center, drive south about 8 miles, then turn left (east) onto a dirt road. Drive about 3.5 miles to the trailhead. To view the falls, hike about 1\/2 mile, cross the creek, then scramble up the rocks and stream into a crevasse where the 25 ft. high falls cascade onto a ledge. Caution: Rocks are slippery. Water may be deep and swift in early summer during snowmelt, or during heavy thunderstorms. Rarely, rocks may fall from above into the crevasse. In winter, the falls freeze, creating an icy sculpture. Ice and snow may make the hike very slippery. Falling ice may be a hazard in spring.  Near the trailhead is Zapata Falls Campground, a primitive campground open year-round.  Contact: Bureau of Land Management, 1803 West Highway 160, Monte Vista, CO 81144, 719-852-7074.        Bison west of the dunes, on the Medano Ranch.

NPS Photo by Scott Hansen  National Wildlife Refuges Because of its many wetlands and strategic location for many unusual migratory birds, the San Luis Valley is home to three national wildlife refuges. Baca NWR was created in 2004 as part of the expansion of Great Sand Dunes National Monument into a national park and preserve, protecting the entire natural hydrological system of the Great Sand Dunes. It is adjacent to the national park on the western boundary. Alamosa NWR is located a few miles southeast of Alamosa, Colorado. It features wetlands along the Rio Grande River. Monte Vista NWR is south of Monte Vista, Colorado. This refuge contains many restored or enhanced wetlands associated with agricultural lands. It is one of the hotspots in the valley to view thousands of sandhill cranes each spring and fall.        The arid San Luis Valley is speckled with verdant wetlands, managed by many public and private land agencies.
