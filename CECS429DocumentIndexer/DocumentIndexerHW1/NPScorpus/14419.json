Be sure to take plenty of food and water.  Be aware of weather conditions. The weather can sometimes be unpredictable, especially at higher elevations. Severe thundersorms often bring lightning and winter storms can move in rapidly bringing ice and snow. Due to damage from the Southern Pine Beetle, some species of pine trees have died and can come down during high winds. Some of the natural plants and animals can cause problems if you come in direct contact with them. Poison Ivy can be found throughout the park and lines many of the trails. Remember: \"Leaves of three leave it be!\"  Bears are active in the park. Please be sure to store food in a secure location when not in use and dispose of garbage appropriately (either take it with you or place into a park bear proof container).  more... There are two venomous snakes in the park: The Northern Copperhead and the Timber Rattler. These snakes are not a problem if left alone.   Learning to identify the native plants and animals can be fun and help ensure a safe trip into the great outdoors! For more information please call (606) 248-2817.",
