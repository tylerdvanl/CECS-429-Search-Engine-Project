Originally called Whittington Lake Reserve when it was built in the late 1890s, this tree-shaded greenway is located along Whittington Creek between West Mountain and Sugarloaf Mountain. It was named for early Hot Springs resident and businessman Hiram A. Whittington. Whittington Park once featured two shallow rowing lakes, several pavillions, tennis courts, carriage drives, and a caretaker's house, but today it simply offers quiet trails for walkers and joggers.
