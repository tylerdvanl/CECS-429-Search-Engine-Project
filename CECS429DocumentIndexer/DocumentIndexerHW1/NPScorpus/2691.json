I am from Cave Creek, Arizona and I can definitely say that I love Arizona with all my heart. I love being outdoors and going on adventures, whether it be backpacking across Catalina Island or through Arizona, snorkeling in the great Barrier Reef or Hawaii, or just going out into the desert behind my house to explore. I genuinely enjoy meeting new people and am always up for a good conversation. I feel extremely grateful to be given the chance to serve the National Parks Service for my summer break, especially when I get to be in the Verde Valley at Montezuma Well, Montezuma Castle, and the Verde River, some of the most amazing places in the country!
