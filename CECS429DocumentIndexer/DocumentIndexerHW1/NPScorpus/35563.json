A fee waiver or fee exemption should be requested three weeks in advance. For forms and guidelines, visit Academic Fee Waivers.  Hiking Hiking in Zion There are many easy trails suitable for larger groups in Zion National Park. For a map and trail descriptions, download the park newspaper.   To allow for meaningful connections to the park resources, we recommend no more than one class of students (20 - 30) on the same part of a trail at a time. One adult chaperone for at least every 10 students is highly recommended. Maximum group size limits for specific trails and park areas are listed on the Academic Fee Waiver.  Logistics Be Prepared Any visit to Zion will include some outdoor walking and exploring. Students should wear sturdy, closed-toe shoes. Hats and sunscreen are recommended on sunny days and rain gear on cloudy days. Each child should carry a water bottle. Restrooms Available at the Zion Canyon Visitor Center, Zion Museum, Zion Lodge, Grotto Picnic Area, Weeping Rock, and Temple of Sinawava. Restrooms are not available along the trails. Use restrooms before hiking. Picnicking The Grotto Picnic Area, on the Zion Canyon Scenic Drive has picnic tables and restrooms. Please remember to search the area for litter when finished. Use recycling bins for aluminum cans. Zion Canyon Shuttle System The Zion Canyon Scenic Drive, past Canyon Junction, is closed to private vehicles from April through early November when the shuttle system is in operation. However, school groups traveling on school buses are allowed. This special consideration is for school buses only. Anyone in a van or passenger vehicle must travel on the school bus or use the shuttle system.  Help Preserve Zion Everything in a national park is protected, from the rocks to the plants and animals. To ensure the protection of Zion and a memorable experience, please follow these guidelines. Choose the Right Trail  Choose a trail that is best suited for the size, age, and ability of your group. Stay On Established Trails  Walking off established roads and trails causes trampled plants and excessive erosion. Do Not Feed Wildlife  Feeding wild animals is illegal and can cause injury or death to the animal or the human. Keep your distance. Keep wildlife WILD. Take Only Pictures, Leave Only Footprints  Enjoy rocks and flowers but leave for others to enjoy too. Do not carve or write on rocks. Carry Out All Trash  Zion is your park. Help keep it clean and beautiful.  For additional ranger program information, please call (435) 772-3256.",
