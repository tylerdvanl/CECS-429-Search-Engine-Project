    "body": "Fruita Campground         Fruita Campground NPS  The Fruita Campground is often described as an oasis within the desert. Adjacent to the Fremont River and surrounded by historic orchards, this developed campground has 64 RV\/tent sites and 7 walk-in tent sites. Each site has a picnic table and firepit (walk-in sites have a grill instead of a firepit), but no individual water, sewage, or electrical hookups. There is a RV dump and potable water fill station near the entrance to Loops A and B. Restrooms feature running water and flush toilets, but no showers. Accessible sites are located adjacent to restrooms.  The nightly fee is $20.00 ($10.00 for Golden Age\/Senior Pass or Golden Access\/Access Pass holders).  Open year-round, the Fruita Campground is the only developed campground in Capitol Reef National Park and as a result often fills by early to mid-afternoon during the spring and fall seasons. Sites are first-come, first-served. Site saving is prohibited. Occupants must be present at time of registration. Generators may not be run outside of approved generator hours to power medical devices or other equipment. Campground Hosts (located at the beginning of Loop A) are available to assist you during the summer season. We do not take reservations. Please help preserve your park and provide for a safe and enjoyable visit by becoming familiar with the campground regulations.   Alternative camping locations may be found in areas surrounding the park.            Fruita Campground MapClick on map to download a .PDF version         Fruita Campsite Dimensions  NPS",
