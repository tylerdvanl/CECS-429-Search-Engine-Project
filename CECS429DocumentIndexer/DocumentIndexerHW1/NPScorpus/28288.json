Signs to the Visitor Center are posted at the Gettysburg exits along US 15 for those approaching from the north or south and along US 30 for those arriving from the east or west. Due to a lack of on-site parking and space limitations in the Eisenhower home, visits can only be made by the shuttle bus leaving from the Gettysburg National Military Park Visitor Center. The Center opens at 8:00 a.m. Tickets may be purchased on a first come, first served basis for the next available tour. For Those With Wheelchairs The Eisenhower shuttle bus is equipped with a wheelchair lift. Visitors using wheelchairs may also arrange to follow the shuttle bus in their private vehicle and park in the site handicapped parking area by notifying the cashier at the Visitor Center ticket counter. Wheel chairs are availabale for loan at the site. For Families With Strollers Due to space limitations, strollers may not be taken aboard the shuttle buses. Loaner strollers are available at the Eisenower site. Notify the bus driver or the staff person greeting your bus to borrow one during your visit.PetsWith the exception of service animals functioning in their work capacity, pets are not allowed on the shuttle bus nor on the site.",
