    "body": "Desert Tortoise iPhone App          Smart phones have increasingly become valuable tools in the conservation of rare species around the world. Mojave Desert Tortoise, a free app on the iTunes store, encourages iPhone users to take photos of any desert tortoises they happen to come across in the Mojave Desert. The app adds GPS data to the photo and sends it to researchers at the Mojave Desert Ecosystem Program (MDEP) and Desert Managers Group. The information will then be used to track the tortoises's movement and habits. You can download the app at iTunes or Android Market.",
