They can provide information on places to see, hiking trails, ranger programs, and current conditions. You'll also find exhibits, restrooms, drinking water, a park film, and a bookstore. Hours vary by season.        La Sal Mountains Viewpoint NPS\/Chris Wonderly  La Sal Mountains Viewpoint  Enjoy a 360-degree view from a relatively flat sandstone bench. See the La Sal Mountains to the east and distinctive formations like the Three Gossips, Sheep Rock, and the Organ in the Courthouse Towers area. Look to the horizon for a view of Balanced Rock and the Windows Section.         Balanced Rock NPS\/Neal Herbert  Balanced Rock A huge sandstone boulder perched on a narrow pedestal seems to defy gravity. View Balanced Rock from the parking lot, or take a short 0.3-mile (0.5 km) trail around its base. Note how the shape and size of Balanced Rock seem to change with every step. Picnic tables are located across the road from the parking area.        South Window NPS\/Jacob W. Frank  The Windows At the Windows Section, you can see some of the largest arches in the park: North Window, South Window, Turret Arch and Double Arch. Easy trails lead to all arches. A slightly longer primitive trail leads around North and South windows.         Delicate Arch NPS\/Neal Herbert  Delicate Arch  You can see the world's most famous natural arch from the Delicate Arch Viewpoint. Trails ranging from easy to moderate provide views of the arch. A difficult trail leads all the way to the arch itself. These trails can be very crowded. You can see historic features like Wolfe Ranch and a rock art panel nearby.        Landscape Arch NPS\/Neal Herbert  Devils Garden An extensive network of trails, easy to difficult, begins in the Devils Garden area. You can take an easy hike to Landscape Arch, North America's longest arch, or continue on a longer, more strenuous hike to see five more arches on the primitive loop. Other nearby trails lead to Sand Dune Arch and Skyline Arch. The Devils Garden Campground and the picnic area are open year round. Water is available.",
