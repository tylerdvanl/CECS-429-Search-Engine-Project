    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility             Accessibility       Mobility impaired The park visitor center is fully accessible and parking for the disabled is located nearby. Certain buildings and areas of the park are, unfortunately, not wheelchair accessible. These include, Aspet, the Ravine Studio, the Formal Gardens, the Picture Gallery and the Nature Trails. Upon request, the mobility impaired may be permitted to drive closer to the New Gallery, Ravine Studio and Little Studio, to allow for easier access. Wheelchairs or walkers are not available at the park for rental or loan. Accessible Parking Parking for visitors with disabilities is available near the Visitor Center. The ranger in the entrance kiosk can direct you to the location. Visitors are also welcome to drive to the visitor center to drop off individuals with mobility problems. Hearing Impaired The orientation film, An Introduction to the Life and Work of Augustus Saint-Gaudens (18 minutes) is shown open captioned at all times.  Visually Impaired In order to help the visually impaired better enjoy the artwork, we allow these visitors to touch some of the sculptures. The visitor must first contact a ranger to request a pair of special cotton gloves and to find out which artworks may be touched (some pieces are too fragile to be handled). Walking surfaces Pathways around the park are found in a variety of surfaces; grass, brick, asphalt, bark mulch, cement and gravel. Because of the historic nature of the site, some of the pathways may be uneven and visitors should always take care when walking around the park. More Information If you have any questions about accessibility at the park, please contact us at (603) 675-2175.",
