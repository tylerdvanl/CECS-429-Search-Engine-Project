    "body": "Fun Facts for Teachers       In the past, Rocky Mountain National Park published Tidbits via the Internet. These Tidbits have been updated and are now a part of the Fun Facts pages which are listed on this page and also on the Fun Facts page in the For Kids section. The original idea was that the Tidbit page would provide a bit of information and some attractive pictures about a natural history topic, an answer to the \"burning question of the week,\" or an event in the park. We have specifically tried to size some of the more attractive large photos to be made into wallpaper for your computer screen (by right clicking on the picture and selecting \"Set as background\"). As a result, we hope you find Fun Facts informative and useful. The following links are to a variety of Fun Facts which your students might enjoy.
