Moreover, as more and more communities develop and grow in areas that are adjacent to fire-prone lands in what is known as the wildland\/urban interface, wildland fires pose increasing threats to people and their property.  The National Fire Plan was developed in August 2000, following a landmark wildland fire season, with the intent of actively responding to severe wildland fires and their impacts to communities while ensuring sufficient firefighting capacity for the future. The NFP addresses five key points: Firefighting, Rehabilitation, Hazardous Fuels Reduction, Community Assistance, and Accountability.
