It is also the meeting place for ranger-led hikes and tours of the monument, demonstrations, and numerous special events throughout the year           Â    Texas' first National Monument    13,000 years ago this site was already well-known by mammoth hunters as a place to get the best stone for their tools. Centuries passed, climates and people groups changed, but the colorful flint found right here in the Texas panhandle never lost its value and usefulness. The quarry pits we see today give us only a clue to the past; they were dug by hand, possibly using bone tools, some 800-500 years ago. Up on the mesa at Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument, you will walk on a thick layer of human-generated flakes of Alibates flint. When you visit, you will gain a sense of how integral this site was to the survival, commerce and culture of people living on the High Plains over many millennia.",
