Years later, Rhoda, her four daughters, Roxanna and her nine children survived the battle of Wilson's Creek by taking refuge in the cellar. After the battle, she and Roxanna cared for the wounded brought to the house.           Anna Elizabeth Steele  When the Homefront is Your Home Annie and her family witnessed warfare first hand. Following the battle of Wilson's Creek, their home was used to care for wounded and dying soldiers. Annie died of typhoid fever the next year at age 19. Her death, along with others, was attributed to unsanitary conditions caused by the improper burial of the battle's dead.            Lieutenant Omer Weaver First Blood  Lieutenant Weaver was from a prominent Little Rock family and carried on a secret romance with a hometown girl named Annie. Fearing her parent's disapproval, they secretly exchanged letters through his mother. Sadly, he was killed during the first hour of fighting at Wilson's Creek, becoming the first Arkansan to die in the Civil War.            Private George Bent Conflicted Loyalties  Born at Bent's Fort in Colorado, Bent learned Cheyenne culture from his mother. As a student in St. Louis, he joined the Missouri State Guard and fought at Wilson's Creek in the Civil War. By 1864, he was living with Cheyenne relatives along Sand Creek. Surviving the massacre of Indian families by US troops there, he fought against them for two years with the Cheyenne.            Lyon Marker Healing on the Homefront  Healing came slowly as the nation came to grips with the devastating losses of the Civil War. Efforts at reconciliation began early as survivors from both sides met and reminisced at battle sites such as Wilson's Creek in Missouri. Today, two out of three Americans have an ancestor who lived through the Civil War.            The Civil War Moves West The Battle of Wilson's Creek  Four months after the Civil War began at Ft. Sumter, South Carolina, the war moved westward. The second major battle-and first west of the Mississippi-was at Wilson's Creek, Missouri on August 10, 1861. Though a Confederate victory, Missouri remained loyal to the Union, making this border state the third most fought over during the war.            Sinkhole Disposition of the Dead  Following a large battle, it was acceptable to bury soldiers in mass graves, very often in sinkholes or dry wells. Soldiers rarely had individual identifi cation which often made it impossible to identify their bodies. More than 90% of the graves at the Springfield National Cemetery relating to the Battle of Wilson's Creek are marked \"Unknown.\"",
