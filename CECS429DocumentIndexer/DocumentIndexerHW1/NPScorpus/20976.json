They must live in damp environments and they will only move about on land during wet weather â€“ usually the winter months. This species belongs to a family of salamanders that do not require bodies of water, but they are capable of surviving in water in case they fall into it. Upon inspection, the garden slender salamander looks more like a small, slimy worm. It is about 2-3 inches long with very short limbs.",
