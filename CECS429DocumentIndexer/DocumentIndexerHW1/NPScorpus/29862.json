Â    Arts in the Parks Art has been part of the history of national parks since the 1870's when Hudson River painters captured majestic American landscapes.  Through their awe-inspiring works, the public came to see these special places in America for the first time.  The works captured their imaginations, spurring them to preserve these lands for future generations. Today art continues to thrive in our national parks.  At Roosevelt-Vanderbilt National Historic Sites, our lands and historic buildings are available to a range of professional, amateur and student artists who express history through imagination and creativity.
