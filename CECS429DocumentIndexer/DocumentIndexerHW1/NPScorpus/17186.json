Unfortunately the paths around the ponds and the river trail are not paved and may be uneven or muddy at times. Please use caution. For your safety it is encouraged to visit with a friend and do not explore the grounds alone in a wheel chair. Please visit our book store and visitor center as it has a ramp and is wheel chair accessible! For any questions please call the park at (202) 692-6080",
