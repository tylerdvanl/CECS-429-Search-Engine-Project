    "body": "Voting Rights Act Story       Joanne Bland: The Voting Rights Act was signed August 6, 1965, right? An election was held in ’66. And I started complaining then.

Ooh, they’re doing that.” People came in and they couldn’t find enough for all of us, so they just went away. But for 35 years, I’ve been telling you the same things that happened in Florida in 2000. You didn’t do nothing about it. Right? And then you thought I was going to be upset in 2000 when them two rich white boys were fighting about the presidency, and then somebody appointed Bush.
