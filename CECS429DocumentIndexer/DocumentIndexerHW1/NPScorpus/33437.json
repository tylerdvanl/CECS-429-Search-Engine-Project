Island Bicycles:378-4941 A Word About Riding Mopeds and Bicycles: Cyclists and moped riders can be lulled into a false sense of security by the island's rural atmosphere. Don't be fooled. The main routes on San Juan Island (see map) are county roads with speed limits of 45 mph, except where posted. Bicycle lanes are limited, especially on Cattle Point Road, so riders should exercise extreme caution, especially when accompanying children. Please ride single file, well spaced in groups of three to four, and move completely off the road when stopped. Before exiting park access roads be sure to come to a complete stop and look both ways before entering the roadway.",
