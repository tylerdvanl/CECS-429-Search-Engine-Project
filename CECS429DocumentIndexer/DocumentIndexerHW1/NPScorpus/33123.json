    "body": "Eagle Peak Trail      Eagle Peak Trail    Longmire Area  Â    Eagle Peak Trail   Distance, round trip: 7.2 miles Elevation gain: 2955 feet Hiking time, round trip: 5 hours Wilderness Camps: None  Trail Description This peak was originally known as Sim-layshe, a Native American word for eagle. When the Longmire family settled nearby, George Longmire anglicized the name to Eagle Peak.   Entering Longmire from the east, drive past the National Park Inn, and turn right at the building with the flagpole. Continue straight through the employee housing area and across a suspension bridge. The trailhead is located 300 feet past the suspension bridge.   For the first two miles the trail ascends steeply through dense forest to a small stream, then continues another mile to a meadow. Beyond the meadow the trail is much steeper and rocky as it climbs the final .5 mile to the 5700 ft. saddle where the trail ends. Use extreme caution when you reach the saddle. This area is exposed and a fall could be deadly. NOTE: Always check current trail conditions before heading out. Log footbridges frequently wash out during the winter or other conditions could be affecting the trail.  Along the Trail Most of the trail lies in old growth forest. Lush subalpine flower fields surround the last .5 mile of the trail. Panoramic views await hikers who reaches Eagle Peak Saddle. Backpacking There is no designated camp along this trail nor atop the Tatoosh Range. Current trail conditions are available park-wide from wilderness information centers, ranger stations, and visitor centers. Fires are prohibited. No pets on trails. Treat water before drinking.",
