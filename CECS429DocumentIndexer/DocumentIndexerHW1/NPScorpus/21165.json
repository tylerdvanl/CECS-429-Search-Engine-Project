But he grabbed me in the back, propelled me around and started pushing me down the street. At that time I didn’t know whether I should forget about non-violence, take my left hand as I am left handed and give him a sock in the eye, or whether I should go limp, or permit him to push me. And these 67 people said, “Go on Mrs. Boynton. Go on to jail. We’ll be there with you.” And of course he pushed me a half block, threw me into the car, and carted me off to jail. And naturally I felt very badly. I started crying.   Click Here to Listen To This and Other Stories Being Told (Flash Required)",
