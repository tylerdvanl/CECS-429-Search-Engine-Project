Visit the Truman Farm Home Photo Tour page to explore the site online.          The Truman Home offers a glimpse at the personal life of the 33rd President of the United States.

Truman Library, the first Presidential Library to be created under the provisions of the 1955 Presidential Libraries Act, was established to preserve the papers, books, and other historical materials relating to former President Harry S. Truman and to make them available to the people in a place suitable for exhibit and research.",
