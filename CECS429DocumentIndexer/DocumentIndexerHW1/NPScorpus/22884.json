Typically, the best time of the year to plan a field trip to Dinosaur for your school group is September and October or early April and May. Please note: we typically do training with our new seasonal staff the last two weeks of April and do not have staff available to give education programs during this time. Please call at least four weeks in advance to inquire about whether staff are available for your field trip. You will also need to apply for a waiver of the entrance fee. Visit our Academic Fee Waiver page for more information and to download an application. Call (435) 781-7701 for more information or to make reservations.",
