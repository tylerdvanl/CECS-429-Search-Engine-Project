You can take the ferry boat to Rattlesnake Island and explore the old Spanish fort. There is also a half-mile boardwalk nature trail through the woods, and a picnic area set among the old, spreading live oak trees.   Children also enjoy walking along the river shore and watching the wading birds and crabs. An entrance to the St. Johns County beach is located just across the street from the park entrance.           2017 Summer Camp Dates and Registration Information will be released in spring of 2017.   2016 Summer Camp Full.

There's no better way to experience the Centennial of the National Park Service, than by joining us at Hands-on-History and Nature Camp!   Park Rangers, Teacher-Ranger-Teachers from St. Johns County, and knowledgeable volunteers will lead campers entering 5th and 6th grade or ages 9-11 through a series of interactive presentations, hands-on projects, games, and living history demonstrations.  Activities require active participation and are designed around important topics; Nature, Spanish Exploration, Maritime Archaeology, Preservation, Colonial Florida, and Spanish Military.  Last summer they went on a nature boat ride, seined the river, examined fossils, dissected owl pellets, and more!  They also left with take-home items such as a journal, shark tooth necklace, and t-shirt.   Camp is Monday-Friday, 9:00 am - 1:00 pm.  Space is limited to 20 campers per week. Participants will be accepted sequentially (first come, first served basis). To help cover the cost of materials, there is a nonrefundable camp fee of $25. If this fee is a financial hardship on your family, contact the Camp Director to learn about our scholarship program.          Be a Web Ranger!
