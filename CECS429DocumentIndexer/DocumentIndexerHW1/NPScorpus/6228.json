Please see directions provided here.  Traffic Traffic along Rt. 12A in Cornish and Plainfield, N.H. and Windsor, Vermont, is reasonably light. The most congested areas of traffic in the region are the shopping plazas adjacent to exit 20 of Rt. I 89, 12 miles north of the park. Parking The main parking lot at the site has room for 22 vehicles. Additional parking is located in the auxiliary lot 1\/10 of a mile west of the main lot. This lot can accommodate large RVs and school busses. Motorcoaches should proceed to the main lot where the ranger will direct them to a special parking spot. Handicapped Parking Parking for those with disabilities is available near the visitor center. The ranger in the kiosk at the main parking lot, will direct you to the parking area for those with disabilities. RVs People traveling in large RVs should be aware that parking is usually available only in the auxiliary parking area. The entrance is located 1\/10 of a mile before coming to the main parking lot.  RVs towing vehicles should always pull into the auxiliary lot, located on the left just before the main parking lot, as there is no easy turn around futher up the road.
