August 12, 2009  Teacher Not Whiling but Working and Blogging Away the Summer  For many people, a trip to one of our country’s national parks is the culmination of a life long dream.  “I always wanted to see Yellowstone,” or “When we retire we’re going to see…(fill in the name of your favorite national park),” are just a few of the comments rangers hear from visitors. Indeed, visits to national parks enrich the lives of many in this nation. However, not everyone can take the big “dream vacation”— often due to a variety of social and economic factors.  Also, many people don't realize that there are plenty of national parks, like Gateway National Recreation Area in NY\/NJ, right near their own backyards. The National Park Service (NPS) Teacher to Ranger to Teacher (TRT) Program offers a solution for those who may never get to parks out west and beyond. At Gateway National Recreation Area (GATE), Teacher-Ranger Renay Moran-Kurklen is one of those teachers.

In the past few decades, climate change science has grown in certainty. While attention has historically focused on mitigation efforts, adaptation is beginning to emerge as an important area. Climate adaptation is critical, since current GHG concentrations will already cause climate change impacts in the next few decades. As a result, society must begin to take steps to prepare for and buffer against climate change impacts. At Gateway National Recreation Area, climate change adaptation means increasing ecosystem resilience and protecting cultural and  recreational resources from damage or loss.
