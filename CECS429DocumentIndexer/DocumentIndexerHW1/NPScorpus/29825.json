These individuals will often try to scam people through misrepresentation and over-charging. We highly recommend purchasing tickets in advance (see below). The only on-site location to purchase authorized tickets is the Statue Cruises official ticket office inside Castle Clinton in Battery Park (links to Google Map). Plan ahead if possible, and avoid these scammers selling overpriced and\/or fake tickets.         RESERVING TICKETS Ferries provide transportation to both Liberty Island (site of the Statue of Liberty) and Ellis Island. One ferry ticket provides access to both islands. Statue Cruises is the official ferry service provider. Purchasing tickets through vendors other than Statue Cruises may result in unnecessary additional charges. All private vessels are prohibited from docking on either island.  The National Park Service recommends purchasing tickets prior to the day of your visit.
