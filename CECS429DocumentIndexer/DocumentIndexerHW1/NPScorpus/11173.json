Following his father's design philosophy, he had an abiding concern that cities be comprehensively planned to provide for healthy living and working conditions and scenic recreational opportunities.His national reputation was established with his early work for the McMillan Commission in Washington, DC to return the nation's capital to its intended beauty.He continued this urban planning work with reports on numerous cities across the country, including Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania;New Haven, Connecticut;and Boulder, Colorado. He was a passionate advocate for the preservation of natural areas throughout the country and wrote the key language of the 1916 Organic Act that established the National Park Service. In 1928 he helped establish the first state park system in California.Toward the end of his life, Rick continued in the forefront of the conservation movement as an active member of the Sierra Club and the California Save-The-Redwoods-League.A grove in Redwoods National Park now bears his name.He would say it was his father who instilled in him the idea that it was his mission \"to protect and perpetuate whatever of beauty and inspirational value [is] inherent in that landscape.\"",
