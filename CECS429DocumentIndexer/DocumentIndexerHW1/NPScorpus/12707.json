Part of a network of air-quality-monitoring sites, it often shows effects of air pollution such as visibility impairment. Visit its web page for information including current levels of ozone, particulate matter, or sulfur dioxide air pollutants; visual range; and weather conditions.

Observation of the canopy is part of a student phenology program that looks at the periodic plant and life-cycle events and how they are influenced by changes in climate.    View webcam                              Foothills Blue Oak  The foothills blue oak webcam provides a view of a single oak located behind the Foothills Visitor Center.

This webcam looks southwest across the Redwood Mountain Grove of giant sequoias to Big Baldy Ridge. Webcams and volunteers working in the historic lookout tower help spot and monitor smoke from fires in Kings Canyon National Park and the adjacent Sequoia National Forest. The site of Park Ridge Lookout was first used for fire detection in 1916. Disclaimer: Displayed webcams are generally located on mountaintops which become inaccessible in winter. They frequently suffer from snowload and winter storms during the course of the winter and 1) fail to upload images, 2) get physically jostled and no longer aim where intended, or 3) the lenses get obscured with snow and ice. As the sites become accessible in spring (spring at 8,000 foot elevation!) they are maintained for the upcoming fire season.   View webcam",
