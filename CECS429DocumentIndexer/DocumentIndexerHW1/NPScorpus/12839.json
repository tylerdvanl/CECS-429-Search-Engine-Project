Other life forms such as fungi, lichens, algae, bacteria, and slime molds can also play large roles in the park's ecosystems. However, these organisms are not well documented or fully understood in most areas. Through partnerships with universities and non-profit groups, Whiskeytown's staff is working to increase our knowledge of these diverse and important groups.",
