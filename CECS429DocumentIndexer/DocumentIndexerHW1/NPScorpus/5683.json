Volunteers are involved in virtually every aspect of preserve operations. Some work full-time during the winter season, while others may work one day a week or even for a few hours on a special project. Some are students and others are retirees looking for adventure during their \"golden years.\" Some maintain and\/or patrol trails while others work as campground hosts or as visitor center personnel. Regardless of age or background, these folks share a desire to make a positive contribution to the management of the preserve. Volunteers are a valuable and valued part of our operation and our community.  For more information regarding the Big Cypress National Preserve volunteer program, please contact the preserve Volunteer Coordinator at 239-695-1229, or by email.
