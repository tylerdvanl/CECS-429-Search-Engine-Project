    "body": "Spring Creek Rearing Station       The Nevada Department of Wildlife operates four fish culture facilities which produce trout for stocking into public waters. Spring Creek Rearing Station is one such facility that is located southeast of the Park on the road to Snake Creek Canyon. Visitors are welcome between the hours of 8 am and 4 pm. Group tours can be arranged by contacting the hatchery supervisor at (775) 234-7319 prior to a planned visit. Station staff will gladly answer questions about the facility and its operations. The rearing station differs from a traditional hatchery in that fish are not hatched here. The facility receives young fish which are then reared to larger size before release. On average, fish remain at the Spring Creek Rearing Station for 9-10 months at which time they are released in public waters for anglers to catch.  The rearing station raises approximately 125,000 catchable-size trout per year.",
