Soon you arrive at the Thurston Lava Tube. A 20 minute 1\/3 mile walk through a tree fern forest and lighted prehistoric cavelike lava tube awaits you. This is an excellent place to stop and listen to the birds. Watch carefully and you may see the red apapane feeding among the equally red ohi'a blossoms. This lava tube was discovered in 1913 by Lorrin Thurston, a local newspaper publisher. At that time the roof of the tube was covered with lava stalactites, but those soon disappeared to souvenir collectors.      As you walk through the tube consider that several hundred years ago a river of red lava rushed through. Watch your head in the tube - there are some spots with a low ceiling!      Go go: Crater Rim Drive Tour - Stop #7 - Puʻu Puaʻi Overlook       Return to: Crater Rim Drive Tour - main page Things to Do",
