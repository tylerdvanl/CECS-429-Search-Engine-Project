Anyone who would like to volunteer to work on trails should meet at Bandy Creek Visitor Center at 8:30 a.m. (ET) and plan start working at 9:00 a.m. on trails around the Bandy Creek Area. Participants should wear sturdy shoes, long sleeves and bring a pair of gloves as well as plenty of water and insect repellent.   That morning there will also be a 45-minute ranger-led program on “Hog Hunting in Big South Fork” that will begin at 9:30 am at the Bandy Creek Amphitheater. The program will discuss a nonnative species, the feral pig and cover their status in the park, how they got in the park, and why the park allows hunting of hogs.   National Public Lands Day is the nation’s largest, single-day volunteer event in which eight federal agencies as well as other groups partner together to maintain and protect the environment.
