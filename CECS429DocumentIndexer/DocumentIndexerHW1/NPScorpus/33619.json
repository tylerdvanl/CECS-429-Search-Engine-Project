Prepared by: Kirsten M. Leong and Daniel J. Decker, Human Dimensions Research Unit, Department of Natural Resources, Cornell University        freshwater sponges in quantico creek   Freshwater sponges have been found in Prince William Forest park! Check out the Freshwater Sponge Study. The National Capitol Region's Inventory and Monitoring team discovered the sponges in 2007 while conducting routine sampling in the park. They identified the species and put together some literature for the park and public. Attached is a resource brief and a full study on the species found at Prince William Forest Park. Thanks to the park, and the park employees, we continue to have the best water quality in Northern Virginia, which I believe is a factor in the presence of this species. We will be conducting more research on this species through the Center of Urban Ecology.       1994: Bat Survey of Prince William Forest Park.
