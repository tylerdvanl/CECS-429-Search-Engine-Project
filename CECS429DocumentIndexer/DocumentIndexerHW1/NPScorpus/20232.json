Our donation box is located in the Plains High School Visitor Center\/Museum.  Historic objects and other items that have a direct relationship to President or Mrs. Carter or the Jimmy Carter National Historic Site, may be donated to the park's museum collection. these items will be preserved for future generation to enjoy and used for learning purposes. Contact Kate Funk, Museum Curator, to discuss anything that you may be considering on donating to the park.
