The gorge section of NRGNR supports the most diverse plant assemblage of any river gorge in the central and southern Appalachians. This is due, in part, to the moisture gradient extremes that exist between the rim and river. The park provides critical habitat for abundant and diverse breeding populations of migratory birds (including the Cerulean warbler, a species in decline elsewhere in its range) Also located in the park is the rare Appalachian Flatrock plant community which includes sedges, cedars and pines. This plant assemblage occurs on flat sandstone ledges along the New River and is dependent on the scouring caused by occasional flooding for its long-term integrity.
