Ford's Theatre The Ford's Theatre building was first constructed in 1833 as the First Baptist Church.  In 1859, the structure was abandoned as a place of worship.  John T. Ford, a theatre entrepreneur from Baltimore, leased the building in 1861.  A church board member predicted a dire fate would fall anyone who turned the former house of worship into a theatre.  In 1862, Ford renovated the theatre and performances began, setting in motion events to follow that would shake America to its core.        The Petersen House. Carol Highsmith Photo  The Petersen House (The House Where Lincoln Died) After President Abraham Lincoln was shot he was carried across the street to the home of William A. Petersen, a German tailor.  He lay dying diagonally across William T. Clark's bed in a room in the back of the house.  Originally built in 1849, the house was expanded in 1858 to accommodate its use as a boarding house.  The night of Lincoln's assassination, over 90 people streamed through the small house to pay their respects to the dying President.        The Star Saloon in 1865. Library of Congress.
