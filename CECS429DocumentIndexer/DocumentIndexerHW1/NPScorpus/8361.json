For long stays, boats must anchor away from the dock and out of the way of other boats.     Anchorages There are a number of areas that provide easy access to the soundside beaches or a place to stay overnight on your boat.  Where you drop your anchor will depend on the draft (depth) of your boat.   Sailboats and deep draft vessels - in Cape Lookout Bight behind the spit - deep water runs close to the spit in this area.  Houseboats and shallow draft vessels - in Cape Lookout Bight behind the spit and along Shackleford Banks from Whale Creek to Wades Shore.  Vessels may anchor for a total of 14 days in water within the boundaries of Cape Lookout National Seashore.",
