Depending on which segment you would like to explore, some or all of these activities may be available. Although the word \"trail\" is used in the name, the Oregon NHT is not a true hiking trail. With 2,170 miles of the original route now in the hands of various private and public entities, access to trail segments depends upon the permission of the land owner. Some segments are open to the public for hiking and other means of recreation, while others are not. Following is a list of suggested activities for getting to know the Oregon NHT. Inquiries about trail segments not listed are best made locally. See the Links and Resources, Trail Sites and the Oregon Trail Auto Tour Route driving directions for more information. CampingThe National Park Service does not offer any camping facilities along the trail. Inquire at local trail resource site for camping opportunities. (see Links and Resources page).
