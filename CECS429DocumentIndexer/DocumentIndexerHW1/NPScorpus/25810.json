Bats utilize Oregon Caves as a resting stop before returning outside to feed. They also use the caves to find mates, but their pups are usually born to the south. Most bats at the Monument roost under the bark of old-growth trees in the summer. More bats come into the cave during very cold periods, perhaps because at that time their usual roosts under the bark on dead old-growth trees may not provide enough insulation. A few individuals hibernate in the caves during the winter, so bats gates have been installed and the caves are closed in the winter to help protect these misunderstood furry friends. The bats most commonly seen near the cave tour path are Townsend big-eared bats (especially in winter), Yuma bats, and long-eared myotis bats.
