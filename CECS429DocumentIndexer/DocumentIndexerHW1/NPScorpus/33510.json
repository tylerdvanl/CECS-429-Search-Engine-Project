Bring props and materials that are otherwise hard to find to your classroom! There are ideas for stand-alone activities as well as materials that can supplement your own classroom curriculum ideas. Trunks feature reproduction and original artifacts, maps, posters, and resource materials such as books, videos, CDs and DVDs.  Each kit is packaged for shipment. The park will ship the trunk or kit to your school on the first date of the reservation. You ship the trunk back to the park on the last date indicated on the reservation. You may pick up and return the trunk in person if you wish to save expenses. NOTE: All shipping costs are the responsibility of the borrowing organization. There is no rental fee.  The following trunks and kits are available for loan to schools in Washington and Idaho within a 150 mile radius of Lake Roosevelt NRA.
