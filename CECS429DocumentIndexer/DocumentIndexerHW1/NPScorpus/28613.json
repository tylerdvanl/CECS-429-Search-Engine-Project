NPS Photos   Â    Gettysburg's Growing Arts Programming includes \"Artists in Residency\"   To inspire, engage and connect with a new generation of artists and visitors, Gettysburg National Military Park and the Gettysburg Foundation have greatly expanded the \"Artist in Residency\" program in 2016, hosting leading artists on the Gettysburg battlefield for month-long residencies from March through November.     The National Parks Arts Foundation (NPAF), through the generous support of the Gettysburg Foundation, and with the cooperation of the National Park Service, is bringing eight innovative artists to Gettysburg, the nation's premier battlefield park, to work and interact with visitors. Each artist will be featured during Gettysburg's First Friday events at the historic Gettysburg Lincoln Railroad Station and give two workshops to the public during their residency. The artists stay in one of the historic houses on the Gettysburg battlefield.    \"Artists-in-Residence are creating new connections with the Gettysburg community and with the American public,\" said Ed W. Clark, superintendent of Gettysburg National Military Park. \"The artists are telling Gettysburg's stories in new, compelling ways that inspire people to learn more and help preserve these special places.\"    Gettysburg Foundation President Joanne Hanley said, \"Gettysburg's NPAF Artists-in-Residence adds an artistic dimension to how Gettysburg's stories are shared as our visitors are able to experience an artist's interpretation of the park and its history, meet the artists in person, and engage and connect with them as they express, through art, the power of this place.\"    The program was created in cooperation with the non-profit National Parks Arts Foundation and the Gettysburg Foundation.    GET INVOLVED   For information about how to apply for residencies at Gettysburg and other national parks, or to learn more about how to support arts in the parks, visit the National Parks Arts Foundation or email them at admin@nationalparksartsfoundation.org.
