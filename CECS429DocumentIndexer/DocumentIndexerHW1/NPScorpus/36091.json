The Visitor Information Center is open daily from 8 am to 4:30 pm. Bring your Texas Hunting License and photo ID. The Annual Hunting Permit authorizes the hunter to hunt in all five of the designated hunt areas for the entire 2015-2016 hunting season, as indicated in the National Park Service Hunting Regulations.  A copy of Amistad National Recreation Area 2015-2016 Hunting Regulations  (6.69 MB) is available to read, print, or download. A printed copy of these hunting regulations is also available at the Visitor Information Center. We urge you to read the hunting regulations carefully, as National Park Service Hunting Regulations are more restrictive than the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department Hunting Regulations. Be Safe! There are venomous reptiles and insects, plants with thorns and spines, caves and sinkholes present throughout the park. Use caution and pay attention to your surroundings. To report an emergency, call 911.  For non-emergencies, call the Val Verde County Sheriff at 830-774-7513 and request the assistance of a park ranger. We recommend that you carry safety items such as a flashlight, compass, first aid kit, maps, and water.  All archeological features and artifacts are protected by Federal law.
