This only enhanced her God-given skill of creativity (sewing at age 10). Gaining all the work, community and social experiences that she could, her sights  were  redirected to home. Five  years ago,  the  longing for her Gullah roots  brought  Grant  back  to the table with insight, expression, organizational  skills, professionalism, culture  awareness  and a deeper artistic vision.  Her love of Gullah Geechee culture and hunger for a role in its presentation and preservation has well-suited her for the many tasks at hand.  Zelda Grant joined the GGCHCC in June 2009.
