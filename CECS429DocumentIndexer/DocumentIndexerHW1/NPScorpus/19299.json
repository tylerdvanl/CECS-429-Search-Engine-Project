The monument also protects both upland and wetland habitats.  The result of this mixing of habitat types is that a great diversity of animals call the monument home. Sightings of whitetail deer, turkey, squirrel, raccoon, turkey vultures and chipmunks are a common occurence during a hike. The forest is filled with songbirds during the summer and you may even see a black rat snake laying on a sunny section of trail, trying to warm itself on a cool morning, or catch a glimpse of a five-lined skink as it scampers through fallen leaves near fire point. However, the animal kingdom includes more than just birds, reptiles and mammals - insects and spiders are part of this kingdom, too. Great spangled fritillaries and Monarch butterflies, as well as Ruby meadowhawk dragonflies, can be often seen hovering above the prairie during the summer months.
