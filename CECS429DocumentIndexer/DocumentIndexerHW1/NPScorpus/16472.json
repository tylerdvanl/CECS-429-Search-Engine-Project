NPS \/ Neal Herbert       The Lake Hotel is the oldest operating hotel in the park. When it opened in 1891, the building resembled other hotels financed by the Northern Pacific Railroad. In 1903, the architect of the Old Faithful Inn, Robert Reamer, designed the Ionic columns, extended the roof in three places, and added the 15 false balconies, which caused it to be known for years as the “Lake Colonial Hotel.” By 1929, additional changes—dining room, porte-cochere (portico), sunroom, plus interior refurbishing—created the landmark we see today.      More Information  Visit Lake, Fishing Bridge, and Bridge Bay Area: Things to do, places to go, and plan your visit.
