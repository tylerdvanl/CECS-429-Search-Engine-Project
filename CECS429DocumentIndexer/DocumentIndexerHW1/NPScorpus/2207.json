It shares the horizon with hundreds of other cinder cones, and examples of two other volcano types. Nearby Oâ€™Leary Peak is a lava dome, a rounded mountain formed from repeated, piled-up lava flows. The San Francisco Peaks, the often-snow-capped mountain just north of Flagstaff, is the only stratovolcano in the San Francisco Volcanic Field. Stratovolcanoes form from accumulated layers of lava, cinders, ash, and mudflows; they are the steep-sided, pointed-top volcanoes that most people think of when they hear the word.   The processes that created Sunset Crater Volcano also created a sculpture garden of extraordinary forms around its base. As new gas vents opened suddenly, spatter cones sprouted from the ground like miniatures of the cone itself. Moving lava developed a crust on the surface as it cooled; caves and lava tubes formed beneath the crust as the lava drained away. Partially cooled lava, pushing through cracks like toothpaste from a tube, solidified into wedge-shaped squeeze-ups, grooved from scraping against the harder rock. Hawaiian terms are used to describe the different types of lava flows: Aa lava has a rough, jagged surface, while pahoehoe lava looks smooth or ropy.   All of these features, and more, can be seen along the Lava Flow Trail. For a quick sample, take a Virtual Field Trip.",
