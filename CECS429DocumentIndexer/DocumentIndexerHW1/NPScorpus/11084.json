These facilities are available close to the Heritage Center parking lot: •Heritage Center: exhibits (archeology, Grand Portage collections, fur trade cultural and natural history), video (The Great Carrying Place), interactive video (The Art of the Trade, Grand Portage Stories), book\/gift shop and accessible restrooms.
