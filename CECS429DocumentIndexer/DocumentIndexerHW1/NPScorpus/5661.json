Handicap parking is available on the top of Last Stand Hill.  Wheelchairs are available for checkout inside the Visitor Center.       Service Animals          Service animals are allowed in national parks. For a definition of a service animal, please see the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) definition. For information on four-footed friends that do not qualify as service animals, see the Pets page. A service animal shall be under the control of its handler. A service animal shall have a harness, leash, or other tether, unless either the handler is unable because of a disability to use a harness, leash, or other tether, or the use of a harness, leash, or other tether would interfere with the service animal's safe, effective performance of work or tasks, in which case the service animal must be otherwise under the handler's control (e.g., voice control, signals, or other effective means).
