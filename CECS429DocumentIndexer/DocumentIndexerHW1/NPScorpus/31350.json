The remains excavated through 1990 are now housed at Baylor University's Mayborn Museum. With the designation of Waco Mammoth as a national monument, the Mayborn has been acknowledged as an official repository for the National Park Service. The Mayborn Museum gives visitors another way to experience this Central Texas wonder. The Waco Mammoth Site Exhibit displays original casts of the fossils beneath a glass floor, allowing visitors a unique, up-close view of exactly how excited excavators found the mammoth bones at the site. A large-screen film and interactive stations tell visitors the story of the mammoth's lives in Texas and the remarkable scientific discoveries at the site.          City of Waco and Parks and Recreation Waco Mammoth National Monument protects 4.93 acres of federal land (recently donated by the City of Waco) in the midst of the city park known as Waco Mammoth Site.
