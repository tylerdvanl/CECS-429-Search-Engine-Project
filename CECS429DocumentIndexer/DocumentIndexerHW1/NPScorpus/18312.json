Painted by Sandra Harris, courtesy of NMAH, Smithsonian Institution  The Carter G. Woodson Home National Historic Site interprets the life and legacy of Dr. Carter G. Woodson.  Known as \"the Father of Black History,\" Woodson created the first scholarly narrative of African American history.   The National Park Service acquired his home in 2005, and is currently in the process of restoring the property.  Woodson lived in this home from 1922 until his death in 1950.  It not only served as his office-home, but was also the headquarters for his organization, the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, Inc. and his publishing company, the Associated Publishers, Inc.   Until the historic site opens to the public, the Mary McLeod Bethune Council House National Historic Site serves as the official visitor's center, located at 1318 Vermont Avenue, NW, Washington, DC.",
