Film is still available at the South Rim, but the closest camera repair is in Phoenix, AZ . There is an automobile mechanic on the South Rim, but only for minor repairs. Most likely the car will have to be towed to Flagstaff or Williams, AZ . Distances are deceiving in this part of the country. It may look like you can visit three parks in one day, but reality is often different. Keep your gas tank full. The next gas station may be quite a distance down the road. Carry water in your car, particularly during summer months.   Lightning Danger Summer thunderstorms (July - September) provide beauty, excitement, and much needed water to Grand Canyon, but they also bring risk. Dangerous, potentially deadly, lightning accompanies thunderstorms. Lightning has killed and injured visitors to the park.
