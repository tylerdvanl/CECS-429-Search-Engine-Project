    "body": "Bighorn Canyon Educational Opportunities   Each year more and more teachers are interested in using Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area as a tool to help their students understand the natural world around them.  Bighorn Canyon features stunning scenery, diverse plant and animal communities, and Paleo-Indian, Native American and Pioneer history.  It is a wonderful outdoor classroom for school groups. The material and links on the following pages should help teachers plan a successful educational experience whether students are able to come to the site or if Bighorn Canyon is brought into the classroom.     The park staff will work with educators to customize the learning experience to the needs of each class.  The staff can present both on and off-site programs.     For more information, please contact Christy Fleming at 307-548-5406.",
