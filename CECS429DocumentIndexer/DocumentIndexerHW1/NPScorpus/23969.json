NPS Photo.   Â      All visitors to the park are encouraged to tour the main section of the cave, the Big Room, on a self-guided tour. The Natural Entrance self-guided tour is also very impressive, but it is not recommended for visitors with health concerns due to a very steep and strenuous descent. Please consider your abilities before attempting to walk down the Natural Entrance. Ranger-guided tours of varying difficulties are available. To reserve tickets for a guided tour, call 877.444.6777 or visit Recreation.gov. While there are a variety of cave tours available - from the self-guided areas of the Big Room to crawling through narrow passageways on the Hall of the White Giant Tour. There are also opportunities for hiking and backcountry camping, attending ranger programs to watching the incredible exodus of Brazilian free-tailed bats out of the cavern in the summer. Additionally, Carlsbad Caverns National Park will be hosting Night Sky Events. The park is a perfect spot for viewing the wonders of the night sky due to its location away from the lights of local communities.",
