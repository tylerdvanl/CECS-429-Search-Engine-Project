Approximately 3,000 Native Americans lived in the San Diego area at that time. The Kumeyaay, or Diegueños according to the Spanish accounts, lived simply in the environment but likely impacted the landscape through the use of fire. Today, largely due to the impacts of European colonization and centuries of growth and development, the habitat Cabrillo saw is now among the rarest in the world. Although only a remnant of that biologically diverse ecosystem remains, it is well worth visiting and protecting.      Learn more from the sections below: Rocky Intertidal Terrestrial Plants Birds Reptiles and Amphibians Mammals Geology  Environmental Factors Research Field Guides            National Parks Bioblitz at Cabrillo   Cabrillo is excited to be a Regional Showcase Park in the Nationwide Bioblitz May 21st and 22nd.",
