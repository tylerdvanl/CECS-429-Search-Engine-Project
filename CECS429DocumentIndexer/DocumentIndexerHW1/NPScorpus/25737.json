Getting there: Willow Cabin can be reached by snowmobile, cross-country skis, snowshoes, dogsled, once snowmobile access has been approved for the season. The road to Exit Glacier is usually closed at the Box Canyon Gate, 1.5 miles off the Seward Highway. From there it is approximately 7 miles to the cabin, but you may have a shorter ski if the road is still open to the Forest Service or National Park Service boundary. Be sure to park at the turnoff before the gate. Keep the gate clear for access by mushers and emergency vehicles.

Each reservation is limited to no more than three nights. Cost: $50 per night. Cancellation Policy: Reservations must be cancelled at least 10 days in advance to receive a refund or credit, unless the cabin is inaccessible due to weather.
