    "body": "GPS Coordinates       GPS users will find coordinates for many popular park locations in the chart below. All coordinates are given in decimal degrees from WGS84 datum. When using your GPS to navigate about the park, please keep these suggestions in mind.  Obey all posted signs and park regulations. Don't blindly follow your GPS! It may know where to go but not necessarily the best way to get there (for example, some roads here are one way). An electronic device is no substitute for common sense. Be wary of accidentally travelling on private lands in order to access public areas. This area is a patchwork of public and private lands.  Good luck and have fun exploring Acadia National Park.
