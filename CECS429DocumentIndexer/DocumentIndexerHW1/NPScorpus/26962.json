The hazardous nature of the rock is the main contributor to this as well as the remoteness of the sites. All routes in the Wheeler Peak area are hazardous with deadly rockfall at all times of year.  Visitor Centers can provide information on routes.  Climbing Regulations When climbing in Great Basin National Park, please remember that the park was established to preserve its outstanding resources and significant geological and scenic values. All biological, cultural and mineral resources, including rocks, should be protected and preserved in their natural state. To help complete this task we ask you to heed the following regulations:  Chiseling, chipping, gluing, or breaking away rock, or otherwise physically altering the rock, is prohibited.  Clean aid, top-roping, or traditional lead climbing are permitted. Painting or otherwise marking the rock including names of climbs or ratings is prohibited. Climbing within 100 yards of an archeological site, including pictographs and petroglyphs, is not permitted. Damaging plant life, including lichens and moss, is prohibited. The installation of climbing bolts, bolt hangers, pitons, and other permanently installed hardware is prohibited.  Registration  Technical climbing registration is voluntary at Great Basin National Park. However, climbers are strongly encouraged to register, especially those attempting any of the alpine routes. Registration forms provide crucial information for rescue personnel. Leaders may register for climbs at the Lehman Caves Visitor Center.  Climbing Etiquette Please climb clean! If using chalk select a color which blends in with the rock (most of the rock in this area is a greyish limestone) and any webbing or cord being used as a rapell anchor should also blend into the surroundings (leave the hot pink at home). Emergency Contacts Rescue resources are very limited and frequently unavailable, or hours away.  Parties should always be capable of self-rescue. If someone is injured or seriously overdue, contact a park ranger or a campground host. If a ranger cannot be found, a pay phone is available at the Great Basin Visitor Center.  Dial 911 to get help.",
