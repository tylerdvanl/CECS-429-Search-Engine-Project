NPS Photo       You might float the Alagnak River today and hardly see another soul. But don't be fooled—this resource-rich area has been home to humans for thousands of years. Archeological surveys have documented sites belonging to the Paleoarctic tradition (9,000 to 7,000 years ago). The oldest radiocarbon dated sites are about 2,300 years old. In 2004, archeologists excavated Alagnak Village. From these ancient campsites and villages all the way to modern fish camps, the Alagnak bears witness to the people who lived there. Modern Yupik, Sugpiaq Alutiiq, and Denaina people from Levelock, Iguigig, Naknek, and other villages make use of the Alagnak area for subsistence fishing, hunting, berry picking, and firewood gathering.

Bring a good map! Much of the land around the river is Native corporation land or private allotments, and most cabins are not on NPS land. Please do not enter private land without permission. If you encounter a cabin, historic debris, or an archeological site, please enjoy it, explore and take pictures! Resist the temptation to take artifacts or otherwise alter what you find. Your good stewardship will help preserve these historic places for future generations.",
