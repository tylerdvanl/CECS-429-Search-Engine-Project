    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Things To Know Before You Come     Getting Around               Getting Around       Great Falls Park is an 800 acre park with fifteen miles of hiking, biking, and horseback riding trails.  All vehicles are restricted to the entrance road and parking lots only and may not drive on any park trail or enter the picnic area. Unloading zones are located next to the picnic area, just off the main entrance road. Trail maps are available at the entrance station and visitor center. Parking The entrance station will provide information on the availability of parking.  On some weekends and holidays in the spring through fall months, the parking lots can fill up, resulting in long lines to get into the park. Plan your visit for earlier or later in the day to avoid the worst of the lines. Getting to the Falls The three Falls Overlooks are located within a two to ten minute walk of the Visitor Center. Overlooks 2 and 3 are fully accessible. It is not possible to view the falls by car.",
