Baldy Dune Solstice Impressions .              Afternoon Metallurgy a sterling sun blankets the broad lake with a million flecks of shimmery silver turning the sky above so bright a shade of gray the horizon disappears in a gleam too painful to look at and too compelling to ignore gulls flying east pull the lustrous mantle behind them with each shiny wing stroke              Sunset Tapestry woven of wind and water it spreads out across the ancient bed of sand and stone  a warp of color a weft of ripples  pale golds and blues intersect a boat’s wake weaves a darker blue accent row across the shimmering warp of the setting sun’s reflection as the brilliant disc slips behind a cloud bank the weaving is complete edged by vibrant bands of rose and coral and violet  a warp of color a weft of ripples  the calm of night smoothes the final wrinkles from the finished cloth               Stopping by the Little Calumet River  at the edge of the water the still brown surface reflects a cloud of damsel flies darting above a tangle of dry branches in and out of the dappled sun glistening iridescent blue and brilliant black             Night Rain after the long dry week the welcome showers blow from inland across the dunes shooting thunder before them like giant volleys across marshes and oak savannahs toward the lake then linger to dampen the sandy slopes clean dust from quivering cottonwoods replenish drying marshes and parched bogs before rolling out to disappear over the lake             The Stump by the Lane opposite the farmhouse gate the grayed remains of a tree planted long ago and cut more recently 1908 and 1998 carved deep in weathered wood the flat mossy stump holds its own epitaph once the tree shaded the fine brick farmhouse and sheltered children at play while birds nested within now it sloughs what bark remains enriches the soil around it and feeds the dandelions and grasses that crowd its crumbling edge             Chellberg Ravine Behind the barn The land dips sharply Through thick woods No good for farming It was left to flourish In its own woodsy way Now stairs and bridges Slippery from last night’s rain Lead down into the ravine Fresh with a trickle of stream And polls of standing water Dappled shade echoes With rasps pf the last cicadas Ginseng and rue anemone Flourish under tiny maples Mosses and lichens color Rough bark and smooth rocks Along the winding way Droplets hang on sheltered leaves Pale and tender in the cool shade Of this ancient untouched flume At the edge of the old farm               Morning at the Douglas Center beside the path near the marsh pond  shards of eggs lay scattered beside a sandy pit  a turtle’s nest invaded, destroyed  as the sun reaches between tall oaks the air warms  in the near distance another train screams by              Marsh Colors at the edge of summer a red-headed woodpecker deepens his dark dwelling in the weathered utility pole milkweed flowers below reflect his brilliant hue showing traces of pink on tight buds             Storm Ride bright white against steel blue rain clouds gulls glide on strong storms winds of the lake following the line where sand and water meet across the dunescape soaring on wings held still and outright for the effortless ride",
