The water-striped mud flats of the low tide in Hallo Bay reflected the morning sun and silhouetted clamming bears off in the distance.

I was unaware of the fact that Katmai had volcanoes and that invasive plants are affecting the national parks and spreading faster than a bear can run. Before arriving in King Salmon, I was a little nervous about going to Brooks camp because even though I am more apprehensive of moose than bears, what could be more nerve-racking than being surrounded by the world’s largest land predators?

Viewed from a distance, or even from the perspective of a person standing on the walkway, it may seem that the walkways eliminate our impact on bears. While the boardwalks and viewing platforms have substantially reduced bear-human conflicts near the falls, they haven’t eliminated them.

Nor does a volcano typically send a column of ash twenty miles into the sky, turning day to night and blanketing a hundred plus mile radius of land in a foot or two of ash. Katmai's volatile young volcano, Novarupta, erupted in such a manner in 1912, and it left behind compelling proof of its explosive might. volcano, ash, Brooks Camp      Through a Ranger’s Eyes: Migration  June 15, 2015 Posted by: Lacey Thomas  5 Comments     Anyone who has ever moved from one home to another knows how stressful the process can be.

Since this bear was well known by rangers and the public, her skull was collected and cleaned so it could be used for educational and interpretive programs. As it turns out, Tundra’s skull reveals a biography of trauma she apparently suffered through several years before. Bones don’t lie. They tell the story of pain and healing. As a yearling cub, this bear apparently persevered through potentially traumatic damage to her skull.      2014 Bearcam Year In Review  December 17, 2014 Posted by: Michael Fitz  25 Comments     2014 proved to be an exciting year for fans of the Brooks River bears.

Much of what we know today about the early American period of Alaska is due to the pioneering efforts of one man, Ivan Petroff. He is largely responsible for compiling the US Census for this territory twice, in 1880 and 1890, as well as exploring and publishing on many areas along the Alaskan coast. In many ways this Russian transplant was the leading American authority on Alaska of his day, a prominent position he held until he was discredited in a most public and humiliating manor during tense international negotiations.

Upon checking my email while watching Pacific waves crash against sea stacks I saw an unexpected message from my former Katmai National Park supervisor. Curious, I thought.

Here nestled within the furthest reaches of the north arm of Lake Naknek, a one to hour motorized boat ride from Brooks Camp, stretches a happy geological accident of numerous granitic islands. These mostly unnamed islands jut out of the dark waters as deeply forested mounds, calling to mind the renowned coast line of Maine. As I glide my kayak through the tangled channels separating the mounds, which appear at a distance like green bristling mole hills, I can almost picture the long receded glaciers that carved these rock formations into the pleasing rounded shapes before me.

Rangers, including myself, were routinely asked, “Will it find another bear to care for it?” My usual response to this question was coldly factual, \"Adoption of cubs by another bear is very rare. It has been documented, but is unlikely to happen.\" However, bears, even young bears, are adaptable and smart. They possess the ability to recognize favorable situations and take advantage of them. 402’s abandoned yearling is no exception. bears, cub, family, adoption, bearcam, Margot Creek, Brooks River, adaptability      Water, Water, Everywhere  September 02, 2014 Posted by: Bryanna Plog  2 Comments     Before arriving in Katmai National Park and Preserve in May, I had worked two years in the desert of the American Southwest. Perhaps it comes as no surprise then that the first thing I noticed about Katmai was the water. Water infuses all life on the planet, but it seems especially prevalent in Katmai.

When I saw the tranquilizing dart strike 854 Divot, I knew that there was much work to do and we needed to be quick about it, but I couldn’t help but feel a sigh of relief. “This might just work,” I thought, “We’ll be able to remove the snare.” Frankly, I never thought we’d get the opportunity. Katmai, Brown Bear, Brooks Camp, Trapping      Being Dominant  July 15, 2014 Posted by: Michael Fitz  6 Comments     Dominant male bears along the Brooks River gain many advantages over other bears. They can access the most preferred fishing spots when they choose, easily appropriate food from other bears, and have a higher likelihood of courting female bears and siring offspring. Gaining access to food allows bears to grow larger. Growing larger gives bears a greater chance to become reproductively successful. bears, dominance, adult male, survival, Katmai      Surprises of the Bear World  July 11, 2014 Posted by: Michael Fitz  48 Comments     Katmai’s female bears go through a somewhat predictable cycle.

However, if your name is Ursus arctos, the brown bear, then springtime may be the hardest season to survive. bears, spring, survival, hunger, starvation, food      Little Monsters?  April 07, 2014 Posted by: Michael Fitz  6 Comments     Prior to 2006, Katmai’s spruce forests appeared healthy. Under the dense canopy of needles, little light filtered through to the forest floor where mosses and shade tolerant shrubs held a dominant foothold. Reaching toward the sky were many spires of green-needled spruces that intercepted much of the incoming light. Today, however, even the casual observer walking through those same forests will find something amiss. white spruce, Picea glauca, spruce bark beetle, Dendroctonus ruftpennis, survival, change, forest, insects      Have Spear, Will Travel  March 10, 2014 Posted by: Kathryn Myers  1 Comments     In 1964, George Gryc, then chief of the Alaska Geology Branch of the USGS, visited the geological survey party that was mapping the Iliamna quadrangle, which was then just north of Katmai National Monument. During his visit, the geologists landed on Grosvenor Lake to do some mapping. During their lunch break, Gryc began investigating a sandstone bluff near the edge of the lake, looking for fossils. According to a 1972 letter to the superintendent from Gryc: “I noticed, rather incidentally, a stick that seemed unusually weathered lying on a ledge. I picked it up and noticed that it was worked. I looked around and after some searching noticed a couple of more similar pieces (shafts) sticking out of a crevice...\" archeology, spear, slate, sheath      What Does a Bone Needle Say?  February 04, 2014 Posted by: Kathryn Myers  2 Comments     A simple bone needle, broken into four pieces, is perhaps not as exciting to look at as a spear point, an oil lamp, or an incised pebble, but it can tell us as much or more about the lives of the people who used it as any finely worked point or intricately carved pebble can. archeology, artifact      The Last Bear Killed at Brooks Camp  January 29, 2014 Posted by: Michael Fitz  23 Comments     In the Brooks Camp Visitor Center, a bear pelt hangs in the rafters. This pelt belonged to a young female bear nicknamed Sister. After obtaining food and equipment from people, Sister became the last bear destroyed at Brooks Camp. This is a story of mistakes and loss. It teaches a lesson that we should never learn the hard way again. bear, bear-human conflict, Brooks Camp, bear management      Baking in Alaska  January 27, 2014 Posted by: Chuck Lindsay  0 Comments     While much of the Lower 48 and Canada have experienced a bitter cold January, Alaskans are experiencing unusually warm temperatures. These warmer-than-average January temperatures are not in themselves unusual, what’s really odd is how long they’ve stuck around. weather, precipitation, temperature, winter      Birth of a Brown Bear  January 22, 2014 Posted by: Michael Fitz  22 Comments     Brown bear cubs are from 1\/3 to 1\/10 of that predicted for female mammals of comparable size. Why would brown bears give birth to such small and vulnerable offspring? Like many natural phenomenon, no one knows for sure but biologists have some ideas. bear, cub, birth, survival, adaptation, evolution      An Underwater Winter  January 14, 2014 Posted by: Masaki Mizushima  2 Comments     As Lake Brooks and Naknek Lake freeze over during the Alaska’s long, cold winter the Brooks River continues to flow. Its currents carrying wind-swept white spruce trees and icy sludge downriver. However, beneath the truculent waters, Brooks River is alive with life. salmon, alevin, eggs, life, death, winter      Incised Pebbles from the Brooks River Area  January 09, 2014 Posted by: Kathryn Myers  0 Comments     To many, the Brooks River is the heart of Katmai National Park & Preserve. It is also a National Historic Landmark and an Archeological District consisting of 20 different prehistoric sites. From 2002-2003, working with the Council of Katmai Descendants, NPS archaeologists partially excavated one of these 20 sites in an attempt to answer research questions and learn about the site before sections were lost to erosion. Some of the artifacts found during this excavation were delicately designed incised pebbles. archeology, artifact, art, religion, Brooks River      2013 Bearcam Year in Review  December 31, 2013 Posted by: Michael Fitz  5 Comments     It was a great year on the bearcam with many memorable moments. Who can forget bear 469’s attempt to persevere through injury, the playfulness of young and well fed bears, or the care mothers took to protect their cubs? The insight gained into the lives of bears and the intimate moments we were able to observe dominate this bearcam year in review. bear, webcam, year-in-review      Deciphering the Novarupta-Katmai Eruption  November 26, 2013 Posted by: Michael Fitz  1 Comments     In the early 20th century geologists had a limited understanding of volcanoes. Plate tectonic theory was still half a century away. Radio communications in remote, volcanically active areas were unreliable or non-existent. Eyewitness accounts of volcanic eruptions were difficult to gather. Seismographs, an essential tool for contemporary volcanologists, were almost unheard of in Alaska. For many years, little was known or understood about what happened in early June 1912 on the northern Alaska Peninsula.

Hibernation is a state of dormancy that allows animals to avoid periods of famine. It takes many forms in mammals, but is particularly remarkable in bears. bear, den, hibernation      Giving Bears Space  September 04, 2013 Posted by: Michael Fitz  0 Comments     Every once and a while, you may see people on the floating bridge while a bear is nearby. The people in the photo above were not behaving appropriately for the unique bear viewing opportunities at Brooks Camp. The wildness of the bears and the wonderful experiences for people at Brooks Camp is dependent on everyone giving bears space. bear, Brooks Camp, habituation, competition      Dynamics of the Brooks River Sockeye  July 27, 2013 Posted by: Michael Fitz  0 Comments     In winter, ice and snow cover much of Katmai’s landscape. Salmon fry bide their time waiting to become smolt and run to sea. Later in the year and soon after the smolt depart, much larger salmon are returning from the ocean. In late June, schools of silvery and energetic fish begin to pulse through the river. During August and September, the Brooks River is dotted with ruby-colored jewels digging nests and fighting for territory. Soon after, the waters of Katmai begin to quiet again. The salmon have spawned and most are dead. Eggs are quietly incubating. These are extreme contrasts, but the Brooks River is a dynamic place. Maybe nothing else better illustrates this than the annual sockeye salmon run--a powerful example of change, adaptation, and instinct. sockeye, salmon, Brooks River, instinct, life cycle      The Resilient Bear  July 14, 2013 Posted by: Michael Fitz  8 Comments     Watching the bearcams on explore.org gives anyone with internet access an opportunity to experience the dynamics of a bear’s world. We get to observe the playfulness of cubs, the intimacy of mating, and the satiation of hunger when a bear eats a salmon. However, when we watch the cams, we will also see some unpleasant aspects of the bears’ world. bear, injury, resiliency      Commenting Policy  July 01, 2013 Posted by: Katmai National Park and Preserve  0 Comments     Comments on blog posts are welcomed and encouraged.
