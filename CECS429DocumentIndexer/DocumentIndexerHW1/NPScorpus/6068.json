The staff at Moores Creek National Battlefield are entrusted with commemorating and preserving for education and military study, the sites and stories surrounding the Battle of Moores Creek Bridge, fought February 27, 1776. Through our education programs, we bring history to the students- they get to touch, see, smell, and feel history first-hand (sorry, no tasting demonstrations!). Sign up your class for our school program and make history come alive for your students. Programs include:   Introduction to the park and to National Parks   10-minute park video- \"In the Most Furious Manner\"   A short program on Colonial Clothing where we dress up some of the students   Black powder Musket Demonstration   Ranger-led Guided Tour   School programs last approximately 2 hours. We also have a great gift shop for those special momento's. To make things easier while planning, we also have a large picnic shelter that can easily accommodate 100 students and teachers. Program requirements:   No more than 100 students\/teachers per visit- large groups must be split up over multiple dates.   Much of the program takes place outside and in nature- please bring appropriate clothing for the weather as well as water, sunscreen, insect repellent, etc.   School programs only occur on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays.   Programs can also cater to your needs, to an extent. If there is a specific topic you want us to cover or a connection you want us to make or build upon, please let us know ahead of time so that we can ensure the program meets your needs. The program currently meets the needs of 4th, 5th, 8th, and 10th grades Social Studies classes.   If you are interested in reserving a school program for your class, grade, or home school group, please contact Matthew Woods, Chief of Interpretation, at 910-283-5591 ex.2222 or e-mail us. Please have a preferred date as well as a couple of alternate dates available so that we can get your group into the park to experience history.",
