Visitors to Chickasaw \"get two parks in one\" – the Platt Historic District and the Lake of the Arbuckles, where they enjoy swimming, boating, hiking, and cycling. In the Lake of the Arbuckles and other fishing areas, anglers can catch white bass, catfish, and sunfish. Hunters, too, can practice their sport in the park. Picnic areas furnish settings for family reunions and campgrounds welcome overnight stays. In addition to reconnecting with family and friends, visitors can get acquainted with some animals and plants.      The park is divided into two districts: the Platt Historic District and the Lake of the Arbuckles.  The Platt Historic District is comprised of the former Platt National Park area, established in 1906, and the Veterans Lake area. The Lake of the Arbuckles was constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation in the late 1960s.",
