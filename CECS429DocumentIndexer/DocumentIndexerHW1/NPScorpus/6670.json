Public River Access & Trails: The western reach of the Scenic River has public access points at the Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge, Smith Falls State Park, and the Middle Niobrara Natural Resource District's Brewer Bridge landing. Other landings are privately owned. Please contact the outfitters for more information.  Nature trails are found at the refuge and state park. The Fort Niobrara Refuge also features a driving tour through elk and bison pastures and a prairie dog colony. The hike to Fort Falls is fairly short and provides a spectacular view.  Seasons  Most people visit the Niobrara National Scenic River from mid-May through mid-October.  The primary season for paddling and floating occurs in June, July and August.  During spring floating conditions, be prepared for variable or unsettled weather and higher water levels. Many migratory birds pass through the valley and nesting Canada geese are often encountered. June is generally a month of transition and by July temperatures can soar into the 90's and low 100's. The hot weather usually lasts through August. Fall brings cooler temperatures, brilliant leaf colors and clearer water. Winter floats are possible (using private equipment) if the river has not iced over. The Cornell Bridge to Smith Falls stretch is normally ice free for most of the winter.  Â     Niobrara National Scenic River Visitor Center NPS Photo",
