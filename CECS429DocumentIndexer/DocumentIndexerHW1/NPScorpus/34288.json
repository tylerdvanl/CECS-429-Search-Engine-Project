Educational groups who wish to visit the park should first review the following pages of information about tours and programs offered at the park. All programs are aligned with the Virginia Standards of Learning and the National Standards for teaching U.S. History. Education programs offered include both ranger-conducted programs and self-guided tours. Lesson plans and teaching aids are also available to download from this website. Teachers have the option of choosing or adapting a program to fit their needs. The park's interpretive rangers are willing to work with school groups to cater tours to specific topics or areas of interest. For ranger-conducted education programs, dates and times go first-come, first-reserved. If we are unable to provide a ranger for your group on the date and time of your planned visit due to a prior reservation or other staffing concerns, your group will be encouraged to pick another date, attend regularly-scheduled public tours on that date or pursue self-guided activities in the park. For more information or to make a reservation, please contact the park's Education Coordinator, Christy Forman, at (703) 361-1339 x1205",
