    "body": "St. Mary Valley         St. Mary Lake is the tell-tale teal color of a glacially fed lake. NPS\/Tim Rains  St. Mary is the eastern gateway to Glacier National Park. Prairies, mountains, and forests all converge here to create a diverse and rich habitat for plants and animals. The open meadows surrounded by dense forests can afford some great opportunities for wildlife viewing. St. Mary Lake, its surface often riffled by the wind, spans almost 10 miles (16 m). A drive along St. Mary Lake provides some of the most incredible vistas available in the park. Bordering the Blackfeet Reservation, Native American history and culture is strong in the St. Mary Valley. Blackfeet, Salish, and Kootenai tribal members participate in the park's Native American Speaks programs. These programs feature award winning performing artists and local drummers and dancers at the St. Mary Visitor Center. For a live glimpse of a portion of the St. Mary Valley, check out our Webcam page; we have a webcam on the St. Mary Visitor Center with a sweeping view of Red Eagle Mountain.
