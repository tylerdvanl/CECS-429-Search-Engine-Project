September 10 through Sun. September 18, 2016  Hosted each year by the Grand Canyon Association, the Grand Canyon Celebration of Art is an annual event that includes 6 days of art related events followed by a 3 month long exhibition in Kolb Studio on the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park. The 8th Annual Celebration of Art will feature over 25 artists from around the country who engaged in a plein air competition and exhibition.       Every September, park visitors and residents have an opportunity to watch artists paint Grand Canyon as they seek to represent the shifting light and shadow, amazing land forms, and vibrant colors of this vast landscape.  Each artist brings a completed studio piece with them and then spends a number of days creating more artwork on the South Rim, on the North Rim, at Phantom Ranch and at Indian Garden during the Plein Air at the Canyon Event.  At the end of the week, on Saturday, the Quick Draw Event takes place in the historic district of Grand Canyon Village. During the auction that immediately follows the Quick Draw event, park residents and visitors  have the opportunity to bid on the paintings that they watched being created that morning, and to bring a piece of Grand Canyon home.  The 2016 Exhibit and Sale runs through the holidays, through  Monday, January 16, 2017.  Proceeds from this event support the goal of funding an art venue at the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. This permanent home will ensure that future generations of park visitors will be able to view the stunning art collection in the Grand Canyon National Park Museum and Grand Canyon Association Collections.
