    "body": "Research: Elk Vegetation Management Plan       Research Overview Many scientific studies on a variety of topics related to elk populations and associated natural resources have been conducted in and\/or adjacent to the park. The results from some of those studies are currently being summarized. The summary will be posted on this page when it is available. In 1994, a joint research initiative was undertaken by the National Park Service and United States Geological Survey (USGS) Biological Resources Division. The purpose of the research was to obtain information necessary to evaluate the population dynamics and ecological effects of elk in the Rocky Mountain National Park area. Results of the research are published in the USGS Open File Report 02-208, \"Ecological Evaluation of the Abundance and Effect of Elk Herbivory in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, 1994-1999.\" The contents of the report may be viewed and\/or downloaded from the following link.           USGS Open File Report 02-208 NPS Photo       References The following bibliography is in two parts. The first part presents the citations for studies, reports, and research specific to Rocky Mountain National Park and adjacent areas. The second set of citations includes work that is relevant and related to the issues that will be addressed in the Elk and Vegetation Management Plan\/EIS. The references presented here are representative of the body of information that will be used in the preparation of the plan\/EIS. The final list of references cited will be published in the draft and final plan\/EIS. Research Specific to the Rocky Mountain National Park Area Alstad, K. P., J. M. Welker, S. A. Williams, and M.
