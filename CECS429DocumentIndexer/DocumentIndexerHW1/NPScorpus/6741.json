    "body": "The Point       When the Wager family,heirs to Robert Harper, sold land to the government for the Armory in 1796, one of the two parcels of land they retained was the \"Ferry Lot Reservation\" (the other tract was the \"Six-Acre Reservation\" which comprised the heart of the Lower Town). The ¾-acre \"Ferry Lot Reservation\" sat at the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers, and became a bustling commercial area as the town of Harpers Ferry grew. [Learn more about the Lower Town]. A major contributor to the prosperity of the \"Ferry Lot Reservation\" was the completion in 1836 of the B&O Railroad viaduct across the Potomac River. By 1859, structures at The Point included The Gault House Saloon, the Wager House Hotel, the Potomac Restaurant, and several other small shops and businesses. The B&O Railroad and Winchester & Potomac Railroad also maintained passenger depots here. But the prosperity of the \"Ferry Lot\" ended with the Civil War. On June 14, 1861, Confederate troops blew up the B&:O Railroad bridge. Eight months later, on February 7, 1862, Union troops burned all the buildings on The Point to prevent Confederate sharpshooters from using them for cover. During the course of the Civil War, the railroad bridge was destroyed and replaced nine times. After 1862, the B&O Railroad began erecting new iron spans designed by Wendell Bollman. By 1870, this \"Bollman Bridge\" was completed. Bollman’s iron spans carried the B&O mainline until 1894, and continued to serve as a highway bridge into the present century. Floodwaters in 1924 swept away three iron spans, but these were promptly replaced. Twelve years later the record Flood of 1936 destroyed this bridge for good.
