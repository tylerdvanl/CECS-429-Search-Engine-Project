    "body": "Fire Management Plan       National Park Service policy requires that each park with vegetation capable of burning prepare a plan to guide a fire management program that is responsive to natural and cultural resource objectives, reduces risks to developed facilities and adjacent communities, and provides for public and staff safety. In 2004, the National Park Service proposed to revise Point Reyes National Seashore's Fire Management Plan to expand the use of prescribed fire and mechanical treatment for all lands under its management. In 2006, the Operational Strategy for the Fire Management Plan was published. The purpose of the Fire Management Plan is to provide a framework for all fire management activities for the Seashore and the North District of Golden Gate National Recreation Area, including suppression of unplanned ignitions, prescribed fire, and mechanical fuels treatments. It is intended to guide the fire management program for approximately the next 10-15 years.
