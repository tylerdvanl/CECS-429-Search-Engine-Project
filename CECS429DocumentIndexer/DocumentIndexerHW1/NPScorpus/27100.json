Eight accessible parking spaces are located in front of the Visitor Center doors. The museum gallery and exhibits, restrooms, and Encampment Store are located on the ground level. A free wheelchair is available on request (first come, first served).  The Theater is a separate building, adjacent to the Visitor Center. To access, take the elevator in the Visitor Center to the second floor and proceed to the Theater building. A handicap ramp and automatic doors are located on the left side of the building. The 18-minute film is closed captioned. The huts at Muhlenbergâ€™s Brigade (Tour Stop 2) are viewable from a vehicle and via a paved trail. There is no hard surface connection between the paved drop-off and the trail nor between the trail and the huts. The National Memorial Arch (Tour Stop 3) is viewable from a vehicle on Gulph Road. The Anthony Wayne Statue (Tour Stop 4) is viewable from the paved drive surrounding it. In the Washington's Headquarters area (Tour Stop 5), a paved path leads to each building. At the headquarters itself, the kitchen is accessible. Four steps lead to the main section of the building. A binder with photographs of the interiors of the building is available. The public restrooms adjacent to headquarters are accessible. Redoubt 3 (Tour Stop 6) is accessible from the pedestrian platform that leads from the parking area to the redoubt. Artillery Park (Tour Stop 7) is viewable from the handicap space by the restroom. The von Steuben Statue (Tour Stop 8) is accessible via the paved walkway that links a ramp to the paved platform. The Washington Memorial Chapel (Tour Stop 9) is accessible via a ramped entrance at the cloisters. There is no automatic door opener for that set of double doors nor is it marked.   Trails and Picnic Areas  All field restrooms throughout the park are wheelchair accessible.  Accessible picnic tables are available at the Betzwood Picnic Area and at the Visitor Center. The six-mile Joseph Plumb Martin Trail is paved, although there are several steep hills on this loop trail. The slopes and lack of handrails means that most, but not all, portions of the trail are accessible. The portion of the Schuylkill River Trail that runs through the park is paved and contains no steep areas. The River Trail (Betzwood Picnic Area to Pawlings Road) is surfaced with packed fine gravel and contains no steep areas.  Tours  Trolley Tours: There are three steps to board the Trolley, and it is wheel-chair accessible through an on- board lift. At Muhlenberg Brigade Huts stop there is a 200' walk across lawn. At the Washington's Headquarters stop there is a 600' walk on paved surfaces to the headquarters building. There are four steps into the building. For guests who prefer to remain on the Trolley at Washington's Headquarters, a picture book of the building's interior is available.",
