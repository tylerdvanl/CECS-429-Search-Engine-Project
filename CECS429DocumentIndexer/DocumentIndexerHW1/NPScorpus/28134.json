It truly has been a spectacular and diverse time to be here, a real blessing.\" -Kathleen M. Heideman, Poet, 2010 Artist in Residence       Big Badlands Overlook by Photographer Rikk Flohr, 2008 Artist in Residence © 2008 Rikk Flohr       The Artist in Residence program at Badlands National Park was founded in 1996 and is open to all professional artists. Writers, composers and all visual and performing artists are invited to interpret this wind-swept environment through their work. The program provides time for artists to get away from everyday responsibilities to focus on their surroundings and their medium.          © 2008 Gabby Salazar  The breathtaking scenery of the Badlands has drawn photographers to this area long before the Artist in Residence program even existed at the park.
