    "body": "Places       Theodore Roosevelt National Park contains several sites of historical significance, each relating to the era of cattle ranching in the late 1800s.  Most significant is Theodore Roosevelt's Elkhorn Ranch Site, the main ranch site where he spent the bulk of his time and where many of his conservation ideas grew. Roosevelt's first ranch home, the Maltese Cross Cabin, is open for viewing at the South Unit Visitor Center. The Long X Trail was used as a corridor to move cattle into the Northern Great Plains in the 1800s, and it passes through the North Unit of the park.  Â    Peaceful Valley Ranch was built in the 1880s and served as a dude ranch from 1918 to the 1930s. The ranch and its owners assisted in the establishment of Theodore Roosevelt National Park. Visitors can still ride horses at Peaceful Valley by taking part in a trail ride with the park's concessionaire. Learn more about the creation of Theodore Roosevelt National Park in Park History.",
