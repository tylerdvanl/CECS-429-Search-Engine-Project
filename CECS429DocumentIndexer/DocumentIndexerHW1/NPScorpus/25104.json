Within the area of the park's present-day boundaries thousands of stampeders have come and gone. Cities have emerged and disappeared. One boomtown has transitioned into an historic site. But what about the backdrop for these human dramas? How have the landscapes changed since the last great gold rush? During an inventory and monitoring project conducted in 2013 and 2014, researchers followed in the footsteps of the stampeders using a technique known as repeat photography to help answer that question.                    Skagway: Then and Now   7 Photos             Chilkoot Trail: Then and Now   14 Photos             White Pass: Then and Now   30 Photos                             What is Repeat Photography? Repeat photography is a cost-effective tool used by scientists and researchers monitoring landscape changes. It has also become a valuable tool in communicating the effects of climate change such as glacial recession. The concept of repeat photography is similar to that of marking a child's growth on a door frame. One returns to the same location at a later date to record the change that has occurred during the intervening period of time. Modern photos of a subject are taken from the same vantage point at different points in time.  The historic photographs selected for this project were taken between 1894 and 1925, with the bulk taken by professional photographers from 1897 to 1899. They were obtained from many locations, including the park's archives and historic photo library, Library and Archives Canada, University of Washington, U.S. Geological Survey, Yukon Archives, photo collections from other institutions.

A Changing Park Photo pairs capture natural resource changes throughout the park. Several photo pairs were produced for the Skagway, White Pass, and Chilkoot  Trail Units and document vegetation, glacial, and anthropogenic changes in each unit. While the park seeks to preserve the historic days of the Klondike gold rush, the surrounding landscapes continue to change. Natural processes such as vegetative succession continue, human development leaves its mark, and a changing climate also contributes to changes in the park. Compare some of the photo pairs and discover for yourself the similarities and differences. Some things to look for could include retreating glaciers, vegetative succession, vertical advance of tree lines, and significant increase of plant growth along rivers.
