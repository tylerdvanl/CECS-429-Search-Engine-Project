    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Weather              Weather       Summers can be very hot with high humidity and frequent afternoon thundershowers. Sun protection, including sunscreen, a hat, and UV protective sunglasses, is highly recommended. Be sure to drink plenty of water. You may want insect repellent if walking the nature trail. Winters are generally cool to mild with occasional cold spells, especially with the wind from the north or off the water. The most temperate periods are the fall and spring seasons when temperatures regularly hover around 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 26 degrees Celsius). During thunderstorms, because of the danger of lightning, the fort will be closed to visitors, and ferry service will be suspended until the storm has moved out of the area. June through November is hurricane season so be sure to check for tropical storms before visiting.",
