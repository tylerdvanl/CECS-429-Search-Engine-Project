    "body": "Camping Options       The only way to spend the night in the parks is to stay at a developed campground (reservations recommended), or hike to a backcountry campsite (free permit required). We have no hotels or lodges in the park. There are plenty of lodging and camping options outside the park. With planning, camping in Redwood National and State Parks will be an enjoyable and rewarding pastime for visitors of all ages, backgrounds, and experience levels.              Developed Campgrounds  We have four developed campgrounds. Summer reservations are almost essential.  These state park campgrounds are easily accessed, well established, and provide RV and tent campers with basic amenities.
