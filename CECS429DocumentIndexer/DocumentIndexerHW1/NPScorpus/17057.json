Visitor Centers              Â    The Lyndon Baines Johnson Memorial Grove on the Potomac was designed by landscape architect Meade Palmer as a living memorial to the late president. Reached by a wooden footbridge, the memorial is composed of two very different areas: a meadow surrounded by lush deciduous trees and a grove of white pines. A spiral trail leads through the grove to a massive, roughly carved granite megalith by sculptor Harold Vogel. There are dramatic views of the National Mall from the lawn in front of the memorial.",
