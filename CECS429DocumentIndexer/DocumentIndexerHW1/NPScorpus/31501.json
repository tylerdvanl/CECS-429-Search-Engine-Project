    "body": "Donate       If you would like to make a monetary contribution to Castle Clinton National Monument, we can accept checks or money orders made payable to the \"National Park Service\". If you have a specific passion and would like the money to go to that cause, you should write a letter or note specifying what the money should be spent on. We would then set up an account to be used solely for that purpose. If you just wish for the park to receive the money, then the park will deposit those funds in the \"general\" donation account, which typically funds educational and interpretive events at the park.
