Flowing through the deep, sheltered valleys in the original Nez Perce territory, they include the Clearwater (himeqisbi’me), Grand Ronde (weli’we), Imnaha (imna’ha), Salmon (naco’oxkus), and Snake (piku’nen) rivers, the last one world-famous for the chasm of Hells Canyon (saqa’nma), the deepest gorge (2,400 meters\/7,900 feet) in North America. The canyon, once a part of the Nez Perce homeland, is now the border between Idaho and Oregon and the principal feature of Hells Canyon National Recreation Area.        Aquatic biologists regularly visit Nez Perce National Historical Park to monitor water quality.
