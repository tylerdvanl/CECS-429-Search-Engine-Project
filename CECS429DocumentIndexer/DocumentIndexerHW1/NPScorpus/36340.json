Big Bend participates in the congressionally authorized Federal Recreation Lands Enhancement Act. Under this program, parks keep 80% of all fees collected; the remaining 20% will be deposited in a special account to be used in parks where fees are not collected. Funds generated by the fees are used to accomplish projects the parks have been unable to fund through yearly Congressional allocations. Your entrance and campground fees help Big Bend National Park complete important projects that directly benefit you and other park visitors. Projects made possible with your fees:  Reconstruction of the boardwalk on the Rio Grande Village Nature Trail Installation of a vault toilet at Hot Springs  Establishment of a visitor center at Castolon Historic District, with permanent exhibits   Improvements to river access boat ramps   Major expansion of the Panther Junction Visitor Center   New wayside exhibits throughout the park   Repair\/rehab of amphitheaters      Â      Recycling Bin and Recycled Metal Artwork NPSPhoto\/Matthew Yarbrough  Recycling Program Big Bend National Park has one of the most comprehensive recycling programs in the National Park Service and the State of Texas. Started in the late 1990s, it has grown to the point that independent audits estimate over 90% of recyclable materials, and 40% of the park's total waste stream, are now being recycled. The program has been recognized as not only being an outstanding example of NPS\/concessioner cooperation, but also for the park's firm commitment to leading by example in this important area of conservation. more...",
