For a definition of a service animal, please go to www.ada.gov\/service_animals_2010.htm. For information on animals that do not qualify as service animals, please see our information on pets in the park.    Service animals are allowed at Washita Battlefield National Historic Site. Service animals are permitted both in the visitor center and on the trail. Owners are encouraged, but not required, to identify their working service animal, such as with a vest. This helps prevent unwarranted \"dog on trail\" complaints from other visitors. There are no plastic bags provided at trailheads for waste products, so please bring your own.",
