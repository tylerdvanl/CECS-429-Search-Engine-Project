The Friends organization (FWC) is a 501-C-3 non-profit organization whose mission is to support and promote Wind Cave National Park as a natural and cultural treasure. In addition, the group strives to expand the awareness of the unique value of Wind Cave National Park to the Black Hills Community and the nation. The Friends organization has helped in many ways - in 2013 the group helped staff install 400 feet of new fence at the park's Wildlife Capture Facility. Friends groups exist across the United States as citizen based advocates for individual national parks. Friends groups are contractual partnerships enabling effective stewardship of these parks. Friends groups can provide community based fundraising for various projects to enhance the local park's interpretative programs or to maintain or install new infrastructure ranging from trails to buildings. Friends groups can receive and administer your ear-marked donation for specific projects. Friends of Wind Cave National Park was incorporated as a non-profit organization by the state of South Dakota in the summer of 2011. Federal tax exempt 501-C-3 non-profit status was attained in 2012. Friends of Wind Cave National Park values your participation, your enthusiasm and generous financial support in helping Wind Cave National Park be one of the true jewels of the National Park system and our national heritage.
