Fees are often collected at the other privately owned and operated sites by self supporting associations working cooperatively with the park. These sites rely on admission fees as they do not receive federal funding for operations and therefore do not accept the National Parks Pass for admission. For more information about fees charged at Partner Sites, please check their websites which can be found at the links below.   At this time federal park passes are not available for purchase at this park.",
