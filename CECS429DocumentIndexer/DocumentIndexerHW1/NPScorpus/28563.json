    "body": "Plants       The park contains a mix of wetlands, wet meadows and forest habitats. The wetlands are found in the historic, former lakebed near the banks of the South Fork of the Little Conemaugh River. Wet meadows fill the remainder of what was once Conemaugh Lake. Some of the native wetland and wet meadow plants include steeplebush, blue vervain, monkey flower and boneset. The slopes above the former lakebed are forested, with black cherry and oak trees forming a canopy over understory plants such as alternate leaved dogwood, violets and ferns.",
