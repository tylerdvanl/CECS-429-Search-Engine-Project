Almost all of the land in the current boundaries of the preserve has been used for reindeer herding.  The preserve is the only national park unit to allow reindeer herding. The Reindeer Herder Program started in Alaska in the 1890s. The program was created to address the decline of caribou as a subsistence food source for Alaska Natives. The Alaska Reindeer Service, headed by the Presbyterian minister Sheldon Jackson, brought 1,280 reindeer from Siberia between 1892 and 1902. From 1902 to 1907, the reindeer population in western Alaska tripled in size from 5,148 reindeer to 15,839 reindeer. In 1918, there were an impressive 50,379 reindeer on the Seward Peninsula.  The ownership of reindeer in Alaska had caused some contention because of the large number of non-natives who owned reindeer. With the passing of the Reindeer Act of 1937, the ownership of almost  all the reindeer in Alaska transferred to Alaska Natives. The Reindeer act of 1937 stated that live reindeer could not be sold or transferred to anyone other than Alaska Natives or Alaska Native organizations  without the consent of the Secretary of the Interior. Soon cabins and corrals were being built throughout   the peninsula to support Alaska Native reindeer herders.  The Civilian Conservations Corps built the Goodhope Cabin in 1938. The cabin retains many of its original features because of its isolated location. Although reindeer herding declined after the 1940s, the cabin was still used by reindeer herders up until the 1970s. Today, travelers and locals use the cabin as an emergency shelter cabin during winter.",
