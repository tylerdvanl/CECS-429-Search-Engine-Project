    "body": "Anadromous Fish       Overview: Including the five species of Northwest salmon, steelhead, and certain bull trout, anadromous fish refers to those that migrate from freshwater rivers to the ocean and back to spawn in their natal streams. These populations of fish play an integral role in the wildlife community as bears, otters, eagles, and many others feast on salmon carcasses as a main source of protein when other food is scarce. Olympic's Pacific salmonid populations truly are a \"gift from the sea\" as they bring nutrients from the marine environment back to the river  and terrestrial ecosytem. As well as a significant food source for other fish and wildlife, the life cycle of various anadromous salmon stocks facilitates the transport of key marine-derived nutrients like carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus to Olympic National Park's forests, lakes, rivers and streams.
