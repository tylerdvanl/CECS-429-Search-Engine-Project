Boat Rides at 6 p.m, 6:40 p.m., and 7:20 p.m. Join us all summer long on the banks of the Merrimack River at the UMass Lowell Bellegarde boathouse. Discover (or rediscover) the Merrimack River and connect with National Park rangers. Each week, we'll be out at our green tent (look for the Arrowhead!) next to the boathouse on selected evenings from 5:30 to 8 p.m. Stop by, chat with the rangers, and find out about all the great activities and programs taking place at Lowell National Historical Park this summer. Check out this website and our Facebook page each week on Sundays to find out which days we'll be at the river that week. We'll be offering short boat rides on the pontoon river boat Francis Cabot Lowell at 6 p.m., 6:40 p.m., and 7:20 p.m. Rides are free and no reservations are necessary, but you must have a ticket to board the boat. Tickets will be available at our green tent starting at 5:30 p.m. on nights that we're out at the river. First come, first served, and tickets are limited to 5 per individual. Boat rides are about 25-30 minutes, with a ranger aboard to answer questions and introduce riders to Lowell National Historical Park. The tour route or time may vary, and may be cancelled due to weather or water levels. The UMass Lowell Bellegarde Boathouse is located at 500 Pawtucket Boulevard, and limited parking is available in the lot next to the boathouse, and along the boulevard. We hope to see you out at the river, and if your boat ride leaves you wanting more, consider one of our full-length tours through Lowell's canals and lock chambers starting from our downtown visitor center at 246 Market Street.
