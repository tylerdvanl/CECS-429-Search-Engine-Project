The most notable body of water lies in the Five Forks Battlefield area of the park. Here, a beaver dam has been built across Hatcher's Run, creating a large pond and wetland area. This diverse habitat is home to a number of larger fish species, such as Bowfin, Bluegill, Chain Pickerel, and Largemouth Bass.  In the creeks of the Eastern Front, made up of a network of two larger creeks and three tributaries of these creeks, a number of smaller fish species have been documented. These shallow, slow-moving systems are home to the Blacknose Dace and Rosyside Dace.",
