The park's two blocks preserve and interpret the neighborhood where Dr. King was born, lived, worked, worshipped, and is buried. Park volunteers work alongside park rangers to greet visitors from around the world and tell the story of one of America's most iconic and important leadersto . Volunteer Opportunities Many volunteers enjoy working as greeters and interpreters at various locations around the park. Whether greeting visitors in the visitor center, Historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, or the Historic Fire Station No. 6, there are fascinating stories to tell. You may also choose to volunteer in the park's bookstore or to assist with tours of Dr. King's birth home. If engaging with visitors is not your interest there are also opportunities to volunteer in the park's administrative and facilities areas. Uniform vests or shirts are provided, appropriate for the volunteer assignment you choose. Opportunities For Groups Too! In addition to joining our team of regular volunteers there are also opportunities for groups and organizations to participate in a one-time volunteer project in the park. Periodically throughout the year the park sponsors special events in which a largen umber of volunteers are needed. Volunteer Training Experienced volunteers frequently have the opportunity to work independently, so we provide training to help you learn the stories and build your skills as a greeter and interpreter. All new volunteers must participate in at least one introductory training session. After that you may participate in as many training sessions as you would like to expand your knowledge about specific sites in the park. Training sessions are held on the fourth Saturday morning of each month from January to October. Volunteer Schedule Once you have applied and completed initial training it's easy to schedule the times when you are available to volunteer in the park. You'll have access to our online volunteer scheduling system where you can commit to specific (generally half day) shift assignments. You'll be able to choose the area where you'd like to volunteer, although you can only select areas for which you have been trained. Apply Now! Just email us to let us know of your interest in volunteering in the park. Be sure to include your name, cell phone number, address, and anything else you think we should know. We'll get back to you with details and an invitation to our next monthly training session.",
