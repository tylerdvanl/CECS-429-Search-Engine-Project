The Scenic Overlook trail runs through this pasture to the Scenic Overlook. You are welcome to hike in this area, but please stay on the trails and use caution in their vicinity. The Scenic Overlook can be accessed by taking the Davis Trail and lower portion of the Prairie Fire Loop without needing to access the bison pasture.    Do not attempt to pet or come in close contact with the bison, even if they approach you. These are wild animals and will charge or defend themselves when feeling threatened. Allow at least 125 yards (more than a football field) between you and the bison.   Tour map is available for download below.  Please check the forecast HERE before hiking.

Falling through the cattle guards can cause broken bones. All backcountry hiking trails are moderately difficult and range from 3.8 to 13 miles.
