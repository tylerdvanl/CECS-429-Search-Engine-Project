By inventorying and assessing the \"scenic resources\" along PHT segments, we help establish conservation priorities and create additional foundations for conservation partnerships.    Â      Kayaks on the shores of the Potomac River with scenic views of the river and treeline. Ben Guell  Scenic Viewpoints on the Potomac Heritage NST  The viewpoints below have been compiled with the help of various PHT network partners over the past couple of years. While defining \"Potomac,\" \"Heritage,\" \"National,\" and \"Trail\" are fairly straight-forward, \"Scenic\" is more elusive and subjective. The viewpoints below are listed generally north to south, and we would appreciate comments:  Do these viewpoints make sense?  Should some be eliminated and others added?   1. Laurel Highlands Hiking Trail. Especially Youghiogheny River valley (mile points 2.5 & 4). Other notable viewpoints include mile points 8, 9, 21.5, 29, 30, 38.5, 61, 62.5; and Conemaugh Gorge (mile points 66.5-69.5). 2.
