    "body": "Park Library and Research Center       The park library maintains a collection of books and secondary sources relative to the American Civil War, the Camp Sumter military prison, northern and southern prisons during the Civil War, and prisoners of war throughout American history, the Andersonville National Cemetery, and the development, interpretation, and administration of Andersonville National Historic Site. Library holdings include books, bound volumes, vertical files, manuscripts, and other materials. Our purpose is to maintain a historic reference facility and a database for park staff to use for writing and planning park programs, to enhance the interpretation of the Camp Sumter military prison and the Andersonville National Cemetery, and provide our visitors with the best park experience available. If you are conducting research on an individual prisoner of war, it is highly unlikely that the park library will have materials or documents that you would find useful.  The park has individual records and personal documents for only a very small number of individuals.  Before scheduling an appointing in the library, email us, and we can determine if we have any pertinent records.  If you are trying to document an individual prisoner, your best source of documents will be his service records, available from the National Archives.    If scheduling an appointment in the library is your best course of action, it is open for public research by appointment only. Appointments must be made at least two weeks in advance. The library may be reserved for research Monday through Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Use of the library may be limited on specific days throughout the year. Please note that the park library is closed on all Federal holidays. Library Research Request Form and Use Policy Copyright and Privacy Restrictions Access to the research library is through the assistance of library staff only. Photocopies of materials will depend on the original's condition and any copyright restrictions. Requests for information about library collections can be made by mail or e-mail. Requests for Duplicates: Requests for copies of material from the library must be made in writing and are limited to six requests per person per year. Copies are limited to 30 pages per request. We reserve the right to refuse requests to provide copies of entire files simply for personal collection. Some library holdings may not be reproduced due to poor condition or restricted use outside the park. Additionally, there are some documents we recommend be obtained from the original source or repository. Andersonville National Historic Site reserves the right to refuse any request for copies by parties outside of the National Park Service where conflict in copyright and ownership of materials may arise. The library staff is limited and replies will take time, so your patience is requested.
