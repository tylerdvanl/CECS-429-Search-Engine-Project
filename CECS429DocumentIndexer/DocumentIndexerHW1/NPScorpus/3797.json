An explosion was heard in Eagle on September 27, 2012 and on October 10, a fire was spotted near the summit of Windfall Mountain, about 2 miles up the Tatonduk River. By October 15, the fire was still going and was emitting steam and a sulfur smell. Overflight photographs revealed a slumping area resembling a mini-volcano crater. More information will be released as it is discovered through continued aerial surveillance and on-the-ground study of this event.
