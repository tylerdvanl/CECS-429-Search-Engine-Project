The National Park Service and park rangers care for and protect more than 380 national parks, monuments, memorials, preserves, historic sites, seashores and other areas across the United States. Core Values        Secretary of the Interior, Gayle Norton visiting Casa Grande Ruins. NPS Photo  The core values of the National Park service are:   Tradition: We are proud of it; we learn from it; we are not bound by it.   Respect: We embrace each other’s differences so that we may enrich the well-being of everyone.   Integrity: We deal honestly and fairly with the public and one another.   Excellence: We strive continually to learn and improve so that we may achieve the highest ideals of public service.   Shared Stewardship: We share a commitment to resource stewardship with the global preservation community.   What does it mean to be a ranger? That's a hard question to answer because there are so many different kinds of rangers. All park rangers protect and preserve natural and cultural resources, but they accomplish these tasks in many different ways. Some rangers fight fires and keep nature safe, others teach about the past. Some study and protect animals or plants. Some maintain structures and roads. All rangers help keep the parks clean. Rangers rescue people, find lost kids, and help make sure everyone is safe. One of the most important parts of being a park ranger is to help everyone understand and appreciate our national treasures so people like you will be willing to care about and care for these wonderful places.
