    "body": "Replace Route 9 Conifer Barrier       There is a need to maintain and preserve the designed landscape that has made the Vanderbilt estate world famous and created memorable experiences formillions of visitors. Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site is one of the most intact remaining Hudson River picturesque landscapes, and depicts the evolution of landscapedesign in America over some 200 years. The National Park Service seeks to manage the landscape to preserve its character as it had developed through 1938,the year Frederick Vanderbilt died and the end of the period of significance. As part of the dynamic cycle of landscapes, sometimes the NPS needs to intervene in order to maintain the intent of the landscape design, or to ensure publicsafety. In this case, NPS proposes to remove an existing stand of white pine and hemlock trees and replace them with the same or similar species. The projectarea is approximately 6.5 acres in size and contains 460 trees. The purpose of the project is twofold. The primary issue is public safety. As a result of an inventory conducted by a certified arborist, over 40% of thetrees were rated as \"high risk\", due to their likelihood of failure and the potential to strike the busy highway. In addition, the stand was planted in 1906for the purpose of screening the Vanderbilt estate from the road and no longer serves its intended function. The NPS is in the process of preparing an Environmental Assessment (EA) of this proposal. When the EA has been completed, it will be posted and madeavailable for public review and comment.on the NPS Planning, Environment, and Public Comment website.
