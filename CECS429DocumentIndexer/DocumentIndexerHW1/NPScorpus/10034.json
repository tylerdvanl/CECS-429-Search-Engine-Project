Construction materials uncovered during Deep Horizon Oil Spill clean up has been removed.  However, because this site is frequently changed by winds and waves the area remains closed.  Further testing will be done to explore future opening of the area. Bird Nesting:  Each year, beginning in mid-March and ending in late summer, the park plays host to several species of ground nesting shorebirds such as Least Terns, Snowy and Wilson's Plovers, and Black skimmers.  During this time, areas around active nests are temporarily closed to visitors and speed limits are reduced to 20 miles per hour (mph).  Visit our Bird Nesting page for a full listing of closures.",
