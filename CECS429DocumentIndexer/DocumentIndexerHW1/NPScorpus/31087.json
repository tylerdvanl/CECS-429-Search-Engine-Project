Johnson National Historical Park? Do you want to have fun while learning about President Johnson and the Texas Hill Country? If so, the Junior Ranger Program is for you! It is an exciting way for children of all ages to explore the park's natural and historical wonders.         What is a Junior Ranger? A junior ranger is someone who, after attending ranger programs and completing activities in a workbook, promises to take care of Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park. It is a great way to learn and have fun in the park!      How Do You Become a Junior Ranger?         When you arrive in the park, stop by the National Park Visitor Center in Johnson City or the LBJ State Park and Historic Site Visitor Center near Stonewall. Ask a park ranger for your junior ranger booklet. It is free to children ages 5 through 10 years old. You will then be ready to begin your junior ranger training! Complete at least 6 actvities in the booklet. Regularly scheduled house tours, wild flower walks, and ranger talks are among the activities offered that will help you complete your booklet. Ask the ranger for information about tour times. Take your completed booklet back to one of the visitor centers. A park employee will check your answers and give you an official Junior Ranger badge. You can take it home and show all your friends!                Want to learn more about the National Park Service and the important role that Junior Rangers play in taking care of our National Parks? Then become a Web Ranger! Visit www.nps.gov\/webrangers. There are activities for children ages 6 to 9, 10 to 12, and 13 and up.",
