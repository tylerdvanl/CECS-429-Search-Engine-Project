A weblog is a journal (or newsletter) that is frequently updated and intended for general public consumption. Blogs generally represent the personality of the author or the Web site. Blogs often focus on a particular subject, such as food, sports, or local news. Some blogs function as online diaries. A typical blog may combine text, images, and links to other blogs, Web pages, and other media related to its topic.
