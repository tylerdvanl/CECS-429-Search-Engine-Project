When Europeans first arrived in Caddo territory, they found well-traversed trails connecting native cultural settlements. The Spanish built missions and posts along the main thoroughfares, which collectively became known as El Camino Real de los Tejas or the Royal Road to the Tejas. El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail was added to the National Trails System by act of Congress in 2004. This nationally significant trail crosses Texas into northwest Louisiana. This is a portion of the historic trail that linked Mexico City with the Spanish colonial capital at Los Adaes (now in Louisiana).
