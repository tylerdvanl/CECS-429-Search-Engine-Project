Bring your food and make a day of it. There are nine covered picnic tables that are available first-come-first-served. If the picnic tables are in use, there are plenty of other comfortable places around the park to set up your own picnic gear. You may bring your own grill or use one of the charcoal grills installed near the picnic areas. Please dispose of your coals responsibly in the coal boxes located around the park. If you bring your own grill, please do not use it inside the bowl area around the outdoor stage. When planning your day, remember that for everyone's safety no glass containers are permitted inside the park. Also, you may not bring in alcohol during the months of June, July and August. To find out more about other park rules and regulations, please read the Superintendent's Compendium.",
