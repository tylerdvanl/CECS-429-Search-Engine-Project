First and foremost, the National Park Service (NPS) is working on drawing the park boundary. We are meeting with state government agencies, nonprofit organizations, municipalities, stakeholders, community members and volunteers to help us define this boundary. We would love your input and hope to hear from you. So please check back here, and on our social media sites, to find out about public meetings and see any official documents produced during the planning process.",
