When caving, we recommend wearing appropriate safety gear including long sleeves, long pants, closed-toed shoes or boots, gloves, kneepads and helmets.

You are strongly encouraged to bring your own headlamps or flashlights, however flashlights can be checked out for free at the visitor center and must be returned each afternoon.  If you have boots or other gear used in caves or mines outside of Lava Beds since 2006, or in caves or mines outside of the United States ever, please leave these items at home. This is an effort to prevent the spread of white-nose syndrome, a deadly fungal bat disease. Current Cave Closures    Blue Grotto Cave Ovis Cave  Paradise Alleys Cave Natural Bridge Cave Thunderbolt Cave (up-flow from trail entrance)  These caves are closed for the protection of maternal bat colonies. Bats are important components of the ecosystem. They provided insect control and pollination of plants, among other functions. Maternity colonies, hibernating bats, and all roosting bats are very sensitive to human disturbance, such as entry in to caves where bats are present. Disturbance can cause drastic declines in bat populations. Townsend's Big-eared bats are listed by the State of California as a Species of Special Concern due to its extreme sensitivity to human disturbance. Lava Beds is home to the largest California population of Townsend's Big-eared Bats and relies on cave closures to protect this healthy population.  This closure typically will remain in effect throughout the duration of the summer.",
