Take the Gallitzin Exit and turn right, following the signs. Visitors prior to 1992 accessed the park in other ways, but the GALLITZIN EXIT of US Route 22 is now the way to access the visitor center and historic area. GPS flaws may direct drivers into the town of Gallitzin instead of to the park. Some users report putting the town as \"Cresson\" instead of \"Gallitzin\" produces the correct driving directions. You may wish to verify your route using a roadmap. Regardless of which direction you are driving on U.S. Route 22, the Gallitzin Exit followed by a right turn will take drivers to the park visitor center.
