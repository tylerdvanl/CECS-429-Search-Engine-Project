Be prepared: carry a map, compass, appropriate weather gear, water, light, matches, first aid kit, signal whistle and food, even for day hikes. Leave an itinerary of your trip with family or friends. Stay in contact with home or friends on longer hikes. Let them know your location and when you've arrived home from your trip. Carry a cell phone, but realize it may not work in remote sections of the Trail. Avoid camping within a half-mile of road crossings. Do not tell strangers where you are headed or plan to camp. If you run into a suspicious person, consider moving on to another location. -  Reproduced from the Ice Age Trail Alliance's website",
