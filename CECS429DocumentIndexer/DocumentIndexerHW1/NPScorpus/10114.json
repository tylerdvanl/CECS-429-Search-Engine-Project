When hiking, be sure to follow the guidelines listed below for a safe and enjoyable visit.   Trail Safety    Be prepared! Wear good hiking shoes and clothing appropriate for the weather. Mississippi summers are hot and humid. Be sure to bring enough water with you depending on your hike and know your limitations.  Prevent injury to one's self and damage to natural resources by staying on the designated trail.  At some places, trails cross roads or follow the parkway's shoulder. Use extreme caution in these situations.  Be alert for fire ants, poison ivy, and venomous snakes - don't put your hands or feet in places you can't see. If hiking alone, let a family member know where you are headed and when you plan to return. After your hike, be sure to check your body and clothing for ticks.",
