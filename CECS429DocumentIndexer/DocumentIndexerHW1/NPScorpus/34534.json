A small, core group of park staff members (Natural Resources) is specifically charged with natural resource inventory, monitoring, management, and planning activities. These staff members are supplemented by staff elsewhere in the park organization (Fire Management and Geographic Information Systems), by staff who provide support services, and by specialized teams (Mid-Atlantic Exotic Plant Management Team and the Mid-Atlantic Inventory and Monitoring Network). These affiliated staff members are generally focused on specific functions or narrow responsibilities related to natural resources. Finally, the Natural Resources Branch extends its capability through development of cooperative relationships with universities, other agencies, and sometimes non-profit organizations.
