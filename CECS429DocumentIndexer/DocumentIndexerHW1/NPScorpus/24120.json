NPS Photo by Barry Nielsen  Generally, in the Gila National Forest, ponderosa pine is the dominant species at elevations between 6,000 and 7,000 feet. Somewhat higher, and in many canyons, is a mixed conifer forest typically dominated by Douglas-fir, often with Gambel's oak. Woodlands of pinon pine, juniper, and oak in varying combinations, are present on drier sites throughout the forest. Riparian areas support rich deciduous or coniferous woodland and, locally, small areas of marsh or other open habitats.",
