    "body": "CESI Assessment Projects by Title          These projects include those that lead to the development of decision support tools that can automate assessments of restoration alternatives. They utilize information and design ideas from Baseline Research, Long-term Monitoring, and Simulation Modeling projects to streamline assessment of the success of restoration efforts. Projects below can be sorted according to year, project title, or principal investigator. Where available, click on project titles for more in-depth project information.
