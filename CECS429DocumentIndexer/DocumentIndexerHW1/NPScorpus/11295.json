Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum April 6, 2016. This year's conference, New Frontiers in Biography and History, will feature more opportunities to engage with the authors. For teacher resource materials from previous conferences please visit our past conferences page          NPS  Local School Partnerships For more than 30 years, we have partnered with the Edward Devotion School, the same school John F. Kennedy attended as a child. Called \"What JFK Means to Me,\" this partnership program immerses third graders in JFK's life, and encourages them to realize their own potential as leaders and citizens. During a public ceremony, students share their impressions of the President through essays and poetry.
