NPS photo  ­      Outdoors with Pets For the protection of your animal, visitors, and Saguaro National Park, pets are allowed only on roadways, picnic areas (except Mam-A-Gah picnic area in the Tucson Mountain District-west) and paved trails (Desert Ecology Trail & Desert Discovery Trail). Pets must be kept on a leash that does not exceed 6 feet at all times. Pets may not be taken on trails, off road, or inside both visitor centers. Pets may not be left unattended in or outside of a vehicle at any time. Safety for your pet: Many threats exist within the park: cactus spines, thorny brush, rattlesnakes, scorpions, and open mine shafts. Heat stroke has lead to death of otherwise healthy animals in the desert. Dogs in unfamiliar surroundings may not drink water even if offered. Safety and consideration of other trail users: In areas where dogs are allowed on the trail, hikers have been threatened and bitten even by friendly dogs and those on a leash. Some people hike in national parks to avoid dogs. Impacts on wildlife: Native animals can be displaced and disturbed by the scent of dogs (felt to be predators). Coyotes and foxes can catch common pet diseases such as parvo; wildlife diseases can pass in the other direction.  Good Dog Walks In Saguaro National Park At Saguaro East The Mica View Road is a less-used graded route that you can start at the picnic area or scenic loop drive turn-off. This provides a trail-like one mile round trip through a lush cactus landscape for you and your pet. On the paved scenic road, try the stretch from North Cactus Forest trailhead to Loma Verde trailhead. This route is less strenuous and has good sight distances for the safety of you and cyclist \/ motorists. At Saguaro West Golden Gate Road is a less-used graded route that you can start at Sendero-Esperanza trailhead. The scenery here is as good as any in the park! Or, try the stretch from Signal Hill picnic area out to the scenic drive, watching for two way-traffic. Since the paved roads in the west district are heavily used by commuters, it is not recommended to walk those routes. For more information Click Here.
