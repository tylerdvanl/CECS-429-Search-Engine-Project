Programs are offered throughout the year and cover a variety of place-based topics in history, science and nature. Ranger availability is very limited due to staffing levels, and self-guided group visits are encouraged. *           To be fair to all schools, there is a maximum of three days for the months of September, October, and November that one school can schedule available ranger-led program dates.

Off-peak months of December, January and February as well as Maple Sugar Time in March do not have a maximum allowed number of dates for ranger-led programs per school at this time.  Reservations for September of the current year through August of the following year are accepted from the fourth Monday in August on. For example ranger led education programs for September 2015 through August 2016 begin on Monday August 24th. Staffing is low. Therefore, we fill early and have difficulty accommodating large groups. Contact the park's education and scheduling office at (219) 395-1885.  E-mail communcation is welcome but all programs must be scheduled through phone conversations for accuracy.  * On select dates, The Douglas Center for Environmenal Education is available for school-class use and park introductions by a ranger if a ranger is not available to lead a formal tour.   * Groups are encouraged to work with the park to obtain educational information they can use on their own while visiting the park on their own.  * Groups are encouraged to let the scheduling office know where and when you will be in the park with your group.   To find out more on how you can bring a group to the park on your own, contact the Education Programs Ranger at her scheduling office or phone (219) 395-1885.
