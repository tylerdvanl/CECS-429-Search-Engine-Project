Colonial is a series of historic adventures ranging from early 17th century colonization, to the American Revolutionary War, to the Civil War earthworks, to a quite, relaxing drive along the scenic Colonial Parkway and of course the excitement of archeological discoveries. At Colonial there is something for every family member's sense of adventure.  At least two - three hours is recommended at each of the sites of Historic Jamestowne and Yorktown. Friendly volunteers at the information desks can help orient you to our sites. Stroll through visitor centers and museums. Visit the museum gift shops. View short introductory films. Then, follow a park ranger or guide on a tour of the historic areas and learn why Colonial National Historical Park is considered the beginning and end of English Colonial America. For younger visitors there are Junior Ranger Programs. Several hands on programs are also available during the summer season. To learn more about these programs visit the  Things to Do web page. As Cape Henry Memorial has no Visitor Center or services, less time is required there. Click on these links for more information about Historic Jamestowne and Yorktown Battlefield.
