    "body": "Dinosaur Blogs       What's a blog? A blog (or weblog) is a web site or page in which items are posted and displayed in reverse chronological order. A weblog is a journal (or newsletter) that is frequently updated and intended for the general public. Due to some limitations within our content management system, we are only able to post entries and cannot accept responses at this time. The Construction Update Blog focuses on information about the construction of the Quarry Visitor Center and Exhibit Hall. This blog will be updated regularly until the new visitor center opens.",
