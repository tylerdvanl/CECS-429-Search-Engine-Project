Learn more about the materials and techniques used in the construction of the Arch in a detailed account by J.E.N. Jensen, Associate Director of the National Park Service. Equally fascinating is the story of the Arch's architect, Eero Saarinen as well as the mathematical equation used to create the catenary curve shape of the Arch.          The image on this page is an animated image of the construction of the Gateway Arch between February 29, 1964 - October 28, 1965.
