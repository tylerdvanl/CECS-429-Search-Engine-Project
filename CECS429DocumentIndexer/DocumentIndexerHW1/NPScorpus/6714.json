The mountains we see today rose 360 million years ago when the continent of Africa collided with the continent of North America. This collision caused the Appalachian Mountains to rise taller than the Rocky Mountains are today. Worn down by rock, wind, rain, and ice, only the roots of these once great mountains remain. The beauty of these gently rolling mountains provides much enjoyment not only for the avid hiker and nature-goer, but also for those who simply wish to admire the blueish-green landscape of the Blue Ridge from afar.",
