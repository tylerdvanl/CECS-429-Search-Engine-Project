The Youth Conservation Corps (YCC) is a summer work-learn-earn employment program that helps participating youth develop an understanding and appreciation of the nation's environment and heritage. The YCC isn't just about work - it's about building a future for yourself and the nation. YCC members learn new skills while conducting work projects to help restore and protect the natural, cultural, and historic resources of our national parks. Not only do YCC employees get paid to work in some of the coolest places in the country, they learn about careers with the National Park Service and gain valuable work skills.  Who can apply? Young men and women, 15 through 18 years of age, who are permanent residents of the United States, its territories, or possessions, are eligible for employment without regard to social, economic, racial, or ethnic backgrounds.
