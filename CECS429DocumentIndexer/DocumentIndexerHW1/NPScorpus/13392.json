If you bring your pet to Yosemite, please protect your pet, other people, and park wildlife by abiding by these regulations: Where Pets Are Allowed    In developed areas On fully paved roads, sidewalks, and bicycle paths (except when signed as not allowing pets) In all campgrounds except walk-in campgrounds (e.g., Camp 4) and in group campsites    Additionally,  pets must be restrained on a leash not more than six feet long or otherwise physically restrained leashed pets may not be left unattended for the courtesy of other visitors, human companions are responsible for cleaning up and depositing pet feces in trash receptacles remember that pet food is also bear food: store pet food as if it were human food.

The National Park Service has prohibited pets on trails for many years. In particular, some pets chase wildlife, pollute water sources, and can become defensive and dangerous in unfamiliar surroundings. Pet owners have the burden to assure their pet does not damage the park values for others in those areas where pets are allowed. Yosemite Hospitality operates a dog kennel in Yosemite Valley from approximately late May through early September. Written proof of immunizations (rabies, distemper, parvo, and Bordetella) must be provided. Dogs must be at least 20 pounds (smaller dogs may be considered if you provide a small kennel). You can get more information about the kennel by calling 209\/372-8326.    There are a few additional (very obscure and unsigned) places where pets are allowed:   Wawona: Wawona Meadow Loop, Chowchilla Mountain Road, and Four Mile and Eleven Mile fire roads (but not the Four Mile Trail in Yosemite Valley).  Hodgdon Meadow: Carlon Road from the trailhead to Hodgdon Meadow and on the Old Big Oak Flat Road from Hodgdon Meadow to Tuolumne Grove parking lot.",
