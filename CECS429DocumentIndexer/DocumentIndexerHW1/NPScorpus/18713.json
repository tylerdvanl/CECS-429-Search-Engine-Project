Charles Dickens coined the word in \"Bleak House,\" and Frederick Douglass apparently liked the word enough to apply it to a tiny stone cabin that sat at the back of Cedar Hill. The Growlery contained a single room with a fireplace. Douglass kept it simply furnished with a desk, stool, and couch. He retreated here to do some of his deep thinking, writing, and reading in seclusion.   One reporter who was lucky enough to gain entry to the \"peculiar little house\" in 1895 found a cozy fire burning in the fireplace and the desk \"literally filled with books and paper.\" Today, visitors can view a reconstruction of the Growlery, built by the National Park Service in 1981, from the exterior.  Â     A modern reconstruction of the Growlery sits on the site of the original structure. NPS\/Johnson",
