    "body": "Permits & Reservations       A special park use is a short-term activity that takes place in a park area and provides a benefit to an individual, group or organization, rather than the public at large. The National Park Service may permit a special park use providing the activity will not cause derogation of the park's resources or values, visitor experiences, or the purpose for which the park was established. Primary consideration will be given to potential resource damage and to anticipated disruption of normal public use.      There are several types of special use permits necessary for certain activities\/events held at Fort Stanwix National Monument. The links below provide you with information regarding such permits.        Special Events: Application for Special Use Permits (PDF) Fort Stanwix Special Use Reference Map (PDF)      Filming\/Photography Application for Commercial Filming\/Photography - Short Form (PDF) Application for Commercial Filming\/Photography - Long Form (PDF)      Research Permit National Park Service Research Permit Information    When you are done filling out the paperwork needed for your event or permit and\/or need help please call the park at 315-338-7730.        RESERVATIONS  If your organization is interested in a ranger guided program, please visit our Group Tours Page.
