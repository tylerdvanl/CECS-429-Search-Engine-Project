    "body": "Women's History in Lowell          As much as the massive brick mills along the Merrimack, \"mill girls\" were an innovation of the early industrial revolution in New England. Lowell's mill workforce in the antebellum decades consisted largely of young single women from the farming communities of northern New England. Most were between 15 and 25, signing on for short stints that rarely exceeded a year at a time. Overall, they averaged about three years of employment before leaving the mills for marriage, migration to the west, other employment, or return to their hometowns. Lowell hosts “Lowell Women’s Week” annually during the first week of March, celebrating the historical and contemporary contributions of women in this city. For more information, please visit the Lowell Women’s Week website.
