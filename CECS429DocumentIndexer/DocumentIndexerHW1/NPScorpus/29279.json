National Park Service  Would you like to save a life? How about protecting the drinking water for 17 million people? Do you want to share your love for the bald eagles? How about spending your day paddling on the river? Do you enjoy talking to people and sharing stories and information? What about graphic design and exhibitry? If any of these sound exciting to you why not join the volunteer team at Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River. Volunteering is just one way to support the park. Volunteering can be done through our partner organizations such as the National Canoe Safety Patrol or the Eagle Institute. Are you a college student or know someone who is that would like to gain practical work experience in a park setting then the Park Ranger Internship may be a right fit. If you would like more information these or any other volunteer opportunities at the park explore the options listed above.",
