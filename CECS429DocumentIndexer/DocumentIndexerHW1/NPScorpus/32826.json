During last week’s NPS Wilderness Leadership Council meeting, Garry Oye, chief of the Wilderness Stewardship Division, presented the 2013 individual award to Kelly Bush, district ranger for the Wilderness District at North Cascades National Park.      A milepost guide to the North Cascades Highway by Mike McQuaide, The Seattle Times, June 30, 2010 There's an old saw that says the journey is half the fun. Which, if you're making the schlep from Seattle to Portland on the Wednesday night before Thanksgiving, can be a bit hard to swallow. Conversely, nowhere does the saying seem more true than on the cross-Cascades journey to the Methow Valley, particularly the 95-mile stretch of Highway 20 — the North Cascades Highway — from Rockport to Winthrop.      Stehekin becoming more accessible by K.C. Mehaffey, The Wenatchee World, April 3, 2010 The North Central Washington town best known for being accessible only by boat, plane or foot-trail is working on different kind of accessibility. Several projects completed or now under way in Stehekin will accommodate people in wheelchairs. New tour buses, restrooms, a nature trail and a boat dock will all comply with standards in the Americans with Disabilities Act.      Going Solar by Ralph Schartz, Courier-Times, March 23, 2010 The Park and Forest Information Center sits on prime real estate, near the intersection of Highway 20 and Highway 9. It also happens to be a prime location for solar power.      Of Time and Wildness in the North Cascades by Tim Steury, Washington State Magazine, Spring 2010 Bob Mierendorf has spent the last couple of decades trying to convince the archaeological establishment that pre-contact Northwest Indians did not confine themselves to the lowlands, but frequented the high country. Now he has an ancient camping site to make his point.",
