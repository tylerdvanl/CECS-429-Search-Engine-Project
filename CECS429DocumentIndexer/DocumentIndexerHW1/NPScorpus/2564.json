At first glance, Kolb Studio appears to be an old house perched on the rim of the canyon.   However, if you step inside, or see it from Bright Angel Trail on your hike out of the canyon, you get the sense it is much more than that.  This is the Victorian home of the Kolb Brothers who created a lasting legacy of adventure, exploration, family love, and amazing Grand Canyon photography that will last as long as the Canyon itself.

September 10 through Sun. September 18, 2016  Hosted each year by the Grand Canyon Association, the Grand Canyon Celebration of Art is an annual event that includes 6 days of art related events followed by a 3 month long exhibition in Kolb Studio on the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park. The 8th Annual Celebration of Art will feature over 25 artists from around the country who engaged in a plein air competition and exhibition.       Every September, park visitors and residents have an opportunity to watch artists paint Grand Canyon as they seek to represent the shifting light and shadow, amazing land forms, and vibrant colors of this vast landscape.  Each artist brings a completed studio piece with them and then spends a number of days creating more artwork on the South Rim, on the North Rim, at Phantom Ranch and at Indian Garden during the Plein Air at the Canyon Event.  At the end of the week, on Saturday, the Quick Draw Event takes place in the historic district of Grand Canyon Village. During the auction that immediately follows the Quick Draw event, park residents and visitors  have the opportunity to bid on the paintings that they watched being created that morning, and to bring a piece of Grand Canyon home.  The 2016 Exhibit and Sale runs through the holidays, through  Monday, January 16, 2017.  Proceeds from this event support the goal of funding an art venue at the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. This permanent home will ensure that future generations of park visitors will be able to view the stunning art collection in the Grand Canyon National Park Museum and Grand Canyon Association Collections.

During 2013 and 2014 the Grand Canyon Association is in the process of rehabilitating this valuable piece of Grand Canyon History in order to keep it available for generations to come. With the help of donors, improvements include: restoration and stabilization work, repainting and rebuilding of retaining wall and porches. Ellsworth L. Kolb and Emery C. Kolb played an important role in the early development of visitor services to the Grand Canyon. Ellsworth and Emery came to the Canyon in 1902. Ellsworth worked as a bellman in the Bright Angel Hotel. The brothers eventually bought a photographic studio in Williams, Arizona and brought the equipment to the Grand Canyon. Their business started out photographing parties going down the Bright Angel Trail. Because water supplies were limited on the rim of the Canyon, they would photograph the mule passengers then run 4 1\/2 miles to Indian Garden where they had set up a photographic lab. Water was available here for processing the film. Then they returned to the rim of the Canyon with the processed pictures ready for the mule passengers on their return. Kolb Studio was constructed on this site from 1904 through 1926. It was a 2 1\/2 story structure with the upper level on the rim of the Canyon. This building saw 23 years of expansion and alterations that brought it to its present day appearance.

Mary Colter's Building - Lookout Studio   10 Photos  Located in Grand Canyon National Park's Historic District on the South Rim. Lookout Studio was yet another building designed by Mary Colter at the Grand Canyon. It was completed in 1914, the same year Hermit’s Rest was completed eight miles west of the Village. In keeping with her style of architecture, Lookout Studio was carefully designed with native stone and an irregular roof line to blend into the rim of the Grand Canyon. On the porch of Lookout Studio was a high power telescope, now on display in the History Room of the Bright Angel Lodge. At Lookout Studio, visitors could view the features of the Grand Canyon and watch mule riders descending into the Canyon. Like Hopi House, it was designed to imitate the stone dwellings of the Pueblo Indians of the southwest. The chimney was made of irregular stones, which allowed soil and debris to collect between the cracks. Plants found a niche for growing, which further blended the building into its surroundings. A lounge was inside the studio with a fireplace and an art room where postcards and artwork were for sale. NPS Photo by Michael Quinn.",
