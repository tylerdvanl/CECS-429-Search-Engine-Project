Unfortunately, most of them were uneducated and could not write, making it difficult to learn much about them. The searchable Mission 2000 database, however, grows every year as more documents are translated and input into the system.  A few of the most compelling stories from Mission 2000 have been summarized by park interpreters and historians. Here are some notable women from the annals of mission history:   Ana María   Cayetana Albizu   Catalina   Gertrudis Gámarra   Inés Tisnado   Luísa Segura   María de los Dolores Burquez   María Emerenciana Romero   María Magdalena Contreras   María Rita Durán   María Rosa Bezerra Nieto   María Soledad Ramírez",
