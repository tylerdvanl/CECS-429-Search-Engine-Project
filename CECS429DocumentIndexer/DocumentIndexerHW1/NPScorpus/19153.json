Since 2006, bats have been dying in unprecedented numbers in the eastern United States and Canada from white-nose syndrome (WNS), a fatal condition associated with exposure to the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans. Although humans aren't susceptible, they can potentially spread the fungus between caves, mines, and other bat roost sites. It is everybody's responsibility to do what we can to prevent the spread of this devastating disease. Get a Free Permit to Explore the Caves Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve has instituted a screening procedure to help prevent the spread of WNS. Screening and cave permits may be obtained at the Monument entrance station, at the Visitor Center or on Ranger guided walks. Permits are valid for the five public caves: Indian Tunnel, Dew Drop, Boy Scout, Beauty, and Buffalo Caves. All other caves are closed to recreational caving. Displaying this permit in your car's vehicle dash will show that you have been through the screening process and that you are helping protect the bats that live here.  If you have gear that has been used in caves or mines since 2005, please leave these items at home. If you cannot leave this gear at home, decontaminate it properly. Decontamination procedures have been developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Learn more about the White-nose Syndrome response plan at Craters of the Moon.",
