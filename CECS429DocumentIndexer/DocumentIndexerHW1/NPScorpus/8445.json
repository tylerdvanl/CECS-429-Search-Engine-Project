NPS       Lighthouse Keeper's Daughters Return to Cape Lookout  Betty “Del” Hinnant and Donna Tripp, oldest daughters of the last official Assistant Keeper James Milford Newcomb at the Cape Lookout Lighthouse, returned for an overnight visit. Del and Donna were interviewed in late January for their memories of living at the lighthouse as little girls in the early 1940s. The park invited them for an overnight visit in appreciation of their contribution to park history. Long-time park volunteers Ed and Rene Burgess hosted the ladies for two nights, February 22 and 23, at the historic 1873 Assistant Keepers’ Quarters at the Lighthouse. Del and Donna believe that they spent the night in the same room that they occupied as youngsters. Memories returned, stories were told, and the two women shared much joy with Cape Lookout National Seashore. It is the first time in 65 years that they have spent the night in their childhood home.",
