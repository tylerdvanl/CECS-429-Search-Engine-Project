If you are seeking general information about Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, you may wish to explore other pages of this website or feel free to contact the park. The information you are seeking may already be available via the Internet, at park visitor centers, or by calling, mailing, or e-mailing your request to the park.  If it is not, you may submit a written FOIA request (there is no official request form, just send us a letter describing the records you desire) to:   Superintendent Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore P.O. Box 40 Munising, MI 49862  You may also submit FOIA requests to the NPS or the DOI. If you have questions on what information is available without submitting a FOIA request or where it may be located, contact one of the NPS or DOI FOIA contacts. Our responsibility is to provide you with copies of the documents you are entitled to receive under the law. We want to work with you to achieve that goal.
