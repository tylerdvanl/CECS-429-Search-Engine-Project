Picnic Areas  San Juan Island National Historical Park has four picnic areas. Three at American Camp and one at English Camp. All four picnic areas are accessible by car. At American Camp the picnic areas are located at the visitor center, adjacent to the Fourth of July beach parking lot, and along South Beach.

Some tables are harder to get to, most notably at South Beach were short areas of sand must be crossed to reach some tables. All three areas have accessible restrooms. The picnic area at English Camp is located at the top of the parking lot and is easily accessible. A fully accessible restroom is also located in the parking area.
