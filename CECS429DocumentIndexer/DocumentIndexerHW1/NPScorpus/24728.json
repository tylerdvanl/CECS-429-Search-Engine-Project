The river is managed free of impoundments and diversion, inaccessible by road, its shorelines primitive and its water unpolluted. The Alagnak is the most popular fly-in fishery in southwest Alaska, and has experienced a significant increase in use over the last several years. The Alagnak Wild River protects populations of all five species of pacific salmon, as well as significant rainbow trout, arctic char, arctic grayling, and northern pike populations. The increasing sport fishery on the river is a topic of concern to many subsistence users and other local residents.  Â     Alagnak Rapids NPS Photo",
