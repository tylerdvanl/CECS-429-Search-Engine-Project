    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Things To Do     Hunting              Sport Hunting      Sport hunting and trapping are permitted in Lake Clark National Preserve, but not within the national park. The information on this page will help you begin planning your your trip. Be advised that thorough hunt planning takes time. You may need to begin as much as 18 months in advance of your hunt to reserve your preferred dates, call references, and finalize any contracts you may need.       Hunters in Lake Clark National Preserve must navigate steep, treacherous terrain in search of Dall’s sheep. Photo courtesy of J. Irvine      The National Park Service and the State of Alaska cooperatively manage the wildlife resources in Lake Clark, therefore you must possess all required Alaska state hunting licenses, tags, and permits and you must comply with State of Alaska sport hunting and trapping regulations. Alaska hunting regulations, set by the Alaska Board of Game, require non-resident sport hunters to either use the services of a licensed hunting guide or to hunt with an Alaska resident who is a close relative. Non-resident aliens must be accompanied by a state licensed guide. Hunting trip arrangements can be made through lodges, air taxis, licensed big game transporters who are licensed by the State of Alaska, or incidental big game transporters (licensed air taxi operators that provide transport services for hunters). The list of companies authorized to operate within the park and preserve is a critical component for your trip planning. For more information or clarification about hunting regulations, please contact the chief ranger.Phone (907 )644-3647Email Please keep in mind that many areas within the preserve are privately owned. Do not enter private land without the land-owners permission.       Park areas are shown in green, and preserve areas are shown in brown. Sport hunting is permitted only in preserve areas, and only in compliance with state regulations.",
