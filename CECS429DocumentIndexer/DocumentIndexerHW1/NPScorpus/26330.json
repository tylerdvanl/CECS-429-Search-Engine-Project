Caves honor our past and are among the last areas we can explore with the same rugged individualism, technology, and communal sharing of pioneers. The cultural history of Oregon Caves National Monument revolves around the cave's discovery, exploration, stewardship, and the resulting national historic structures that surround the caves. Examining this heritage provides levels of experience so that each of us can have our expectations and limits challenged and our curiosity, respect, and compassion increased. As a result, our estrangement from nature is reduced and a special place is made from a space. Among the best ideas ever, our National Parks and Monuments define us as individuals, a species, a community, and a nation.",
