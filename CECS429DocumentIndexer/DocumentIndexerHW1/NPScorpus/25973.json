    "body": "Below the prairie sits Wind Cave, one of the world's longest and most complex caves. The cave is home to an array of unusual formations, including the rare boxwork. Above, swaying prairie grasses, forested hillsides, and wildlife such as bison, elk, and prairie dogs populate one of America's oldest national parks.   Wind Cave National Park is open all year and teachers can bring students for regularly scheduled cave tours any time. Teachers may request a program that supports a particular classroom objective for their special visit to the cave. Suggested pre-visit lesson plans for learning about caves are available on the park's website. Reservations may be made by calling the park at 605-745-4600.   Named for barometric winds at its entrance, Wind Cave is a complex labyrinth of passages that contains a unique formation called boxwork.
