Montezuma Castle, Montezuma Well & Tuzigoot National Monuments celebrated by holding youth-centered art events at all three sites. Check out the art below for Montezuma Castle and Montezuma Well! Art played a major role in the creation of National Parks by bringing the beauty and splendor of our nation's landscapes to the attention of Congress and the public. The national park concept is credited to artist George Catlin who wrote in 1832 about the need for a \"nation's park\" to preserve and protect the wilderness and wildlife of our nation. To honor the impact of art in the history of the National Park Service, the staff of Montezuma Castle and Tuzigoot National Monuments had children of all ages-our future stewards-to come out and get creative.
