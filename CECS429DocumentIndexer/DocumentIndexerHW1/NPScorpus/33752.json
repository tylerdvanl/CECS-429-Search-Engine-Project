Please understand that those connections are always provisional and thus subject to correction or other revision.  The website presents documents for the appraisal of readers, not as endorsement of any portrayals of persons, places, or events. The documents are subjective artifacts of past eras.  Final judgment of veracity is left to each reader.  The website makes no claim of offering a comprehensive inventory of significant persons, places, or events in the Green Springs National Historic Landmark District. Rather, we offer an introductory collection of historical information found by or made available to National Park Service research staff.",
