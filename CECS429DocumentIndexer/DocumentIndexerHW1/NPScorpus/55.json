Recreation Fees provide a vital source of revenue for improving facilities and services for park visitors. In many national parks, 80% of Recreation Fees improve the park in which they are collected and the remaining 20% is distributed throughout the National Park System. At Voyageurs National Park, 100% of Recreation Fees go back to the park.
