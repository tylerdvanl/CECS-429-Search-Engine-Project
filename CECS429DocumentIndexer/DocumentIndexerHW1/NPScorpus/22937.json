Schools within a 1-2 hour driving range from White Sands National Monument may request a ranger to present a program in the classroom. (This includes the communities of Alamogordo, Tularosa, Cloudcroft, Las Cruces, and El Paso.) If you would like a ranger to visit your classroom for an education program, fill out our Ranger Program Request Form.  On this form, you will be asked to provide program types, date choices, and specific curriculum standards that you would like the ranger to cover during your education program.  Each program will be tailored to meet your class's educational needs.  The park requires at least four (4) week's notice in order to schedule and prepare for the program.  Download the Ranger Program Request Form.  Once you've downloaded and filled it out completely, submit it via one of the following ways: 1) Fax it to 575-479-1116 to the attention of the Education Specialist 2) Email it to whsa_education@nps.gov   Supplemental Materials: The White Sands Puppet Theater   The White Sands Puppet Theater is a portable puppet show presented by rangers.  It uses a variety of puppets and is designed to teach students about the animals that make their homes in the dunes. If you would like to arrange a puppet show, please download the puppet show reservation form. Mail the completed from to whsa_education@nps.gov or fax it to (575) 479-1116. The Education Coordinator will then contact you to confirm the details.   Due to the size of the theater set-up and both the space and time required to set it up, it is recommended this is presented to more than a single classroom at one time. We prefer an audience of 70-80 students for this presentation.    We will do our best to accommodate all requests. Please keep in mind, however, that due to staffing levels or demand, there may be dates on which we may not be able to do so.      Puppet Shows Available   Pedro Ponders the Past   Pedro Ponders the Past is a one-act puppet skit on the geological history of White Sands National Monument written by Teacher-Ranger-Teacher Joplin J.
