The programs focused on Lincoln's vision for America as he expressed it during his life, a vision that moved the nation from Civil War toward Civil Rights. Each program began with a National Park Service Park Ranger who not only served to open the program, but whose own story stands as an example of Lincoln's vision for America. The program featured accomplished Lincoln actor, Fritz Klein, who gave a presentation on Abraham Lincoln's commitment to the idea that the United States was \"conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\" Click here to download this poster graphic (large file).      Click here to view an overview video of the \"Abraham Lincoln's Journey Home\" program.             Lincoln actor Fritz Klein and Park Ranger Duey Kol approaching the Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg.
