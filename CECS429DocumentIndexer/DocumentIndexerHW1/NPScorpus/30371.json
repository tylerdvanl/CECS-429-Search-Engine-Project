    "body": "Women on the Farm         Courtesy\/Bath Township Historical Society  More than farmers' wives, women in the Cuyahoga Valley have been integral to the functioning of family farms. Many have plowed fields alongside husbands and sons, or made cheese for the dairy operations. More surprising, research has revealed that a few women ran (and run!) farms in their own right. Elizabeth Hynton, John Hynton's surviving spouse, lived in the Frazee House after 1861 and is listed as the farm's owner. Comparing her farm to others in the area, we find that her farm has more land in improved acreage than the average farm and produced 480 eggs and over 600 pounds of butter in a year!

Even today, the valley is home to farming women, including Laura DeYoung of The Spicy Lamb Farm.
