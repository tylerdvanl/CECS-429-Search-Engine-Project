    "body": "Design and Construction Updates       Timeless in simplicity and beauty, like its landscape, both stark and serene, the Memorial should be quiet in reverence, yet powerful in form,  a place both solemn and uplifting. Paul Murdoch, Architect   Flight 93 National Memorial has come a long way since Congress authorized its development in 2002. An international competition was conducted to choose the design for the permanent memorial and over 1,000 entries were submitted. The work of Paul Murdoch Architects and Nelson Byrd Woltz Landscape Architects was selected after a two-stage competition. That design is now taking shape. The first features of the memorial were dedicated on September 10, 2011. The Visitor Center opened to the public on September 10, 2015. Work continues on the remaining features.        National Park Service  Current Progress Visitor Center is now OPEN  Construction is now complete for Visitor Center Complex.
