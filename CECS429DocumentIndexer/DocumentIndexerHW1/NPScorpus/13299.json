    "body": "Picnicking       Picnic areas are available throughout Yosemite on a first-come, first-served basis (reservations are not available) from dawn to dusk. Unless otherwise noted, all picnic areas in Yosemite have picnic tables, vault toilets, garbage and recycling receptacles. All picnic areas have grills except Cascades, Lower Yosemite Fall, Church Bowl, Yosemite Creek, and Lembert Dome. No picnic areas have potable water. Keep Wildlife Wild Yosemite is home to black bears, mule deer, mountain lions, and hundreds of other species. Bears are quick learners, have a powerful sense of smell, and seek out food where it can easily be found. If a bear obtains human food, it may learn to return for more. For your safety and that of wildlife:  Keep your distance from animals, even if they approach you. Never feed wild animals. Dispose of trash in bear-proof trash cans or dumpsters. While enjoying your picnic, keep your food, trash, and other scented items within armâ€™s reach. If a bear approaches, yell as loudly as possible to scare the bear away.",
