This is one of 4 clips from the 30 minute film.         Obstacle Course Physical fitness is always a key to sucess. This obstacle course challenged even the most fit recruits.         House of Horrors Both Area A (Prince William Forest Park) and Area B (Catoctin Mountain Park) had a House of Horrors or 'pistol house.' In the dead of night recruits would be awakened to complete real life instinctive firing exercises.         Demolitions Training Many of the recruits learned how to detonate explosives on large structures such as houses and bridges in Prince William Forest Park.         Frontal Assault One of the more complicated military maneuvers is a frontal assault on a fixed position.
