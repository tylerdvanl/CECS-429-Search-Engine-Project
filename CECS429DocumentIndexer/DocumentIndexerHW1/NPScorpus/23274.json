BUCCANERO  Although Capulin is primarily known for its volcanic geology, the park boasts a rich diversity of plant and animal life. The grasslands of the Great Plains and the forests of the Rocky Mountains combine at Capulin to form a unique ecotone which provides habitat for 73 species of birds in addition to numerous other animals. Mule deer can be found in abundance both at the base of the volcano and on its slopes, while elk, black bears, coyotes, and mountain lions occasionally make appearances within park boundaries.",
