New images of items from our collection are added periodically.          Witness Tree Project   2 Photos  The Witness Tree Project is a collaborative venture of the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) and the National Park Service. Witness trees are ancient trees that have \"witnessed\" key events and people in history. RISD students enrolled in a joint history seminar and furniture design studio have interpreted the history selected trees from NPS sites have witnessed to create relevant objects from the tree's wood. In 2015 the Project used wood from the Van Buren Mulberry that stood just south of the library until 2011.",
