    "body": "Roger Toll's Notebook, 1934         Roger Toll in the Big Bend, February 1936. NPS Historic Photograph Collection  Roger Wolcott Toll served as Superintendent of Yellowstone National Park from 1929 until 1936. During the slow winter seasons, Toll was assigned the task of evaluating proposed additions to the National Park System. In an eight year period, Roger Toll inspected over 129 areas as potential national parks; most did not meet his criteria. In January of 1934, nearly a year after the Big Bend was designated a Texas State Park, Toll ventured to the region, to judge the area for himself. Over six days, Toll received a quick introduction to the scenic highlights of the Big Bend, hosted by park boosters such as Everett Townsend and area ranchers like Sam Nail and Homer Wilson. In March, Toll wrote a report of his trip for his supervisors in Washington, D.C. Writing that \"the Big Bend Country seems to be decidedly the outstanding scenic area of Texas,\" Toll's endorsement of the area was a first, important step towards the establishment of Big Bend National Park. Roger Toll would return to the Big Bend two years later as a member of the International Park Commission, exploring the possibility of a U.S.-Mexico park in the Big Bend area. On the way from Big Bend to Tucson, Arizona, Roger Toll and George Wright were killed in an automobile accident on February 25, 1936. Today, two peaks in the Chisos Mountains are named in honor of these men. Below is the itinerary from Roger Toll's 1934 trip, as included in his report.
