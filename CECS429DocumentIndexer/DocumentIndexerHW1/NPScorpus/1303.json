This beautiful park has many accessible facilities for visitors, including visitor centers, scenic overlooks, self-guided trails, campgrounds, some picnic areas and a backcountry campsite. This spectacular high-elevation park ranges in altitude from the lowest valleys at about 7,700 feet to the summit of the highest mountain - Longs Peak - at 14,259 feet; scenic Trail Ridge Road crests at 12,183 feet as it crosses the park and the Continental Divide. These high altitudes can worsen preexisting medical conditions. The higher you go, the harder your body needs to work. Allow your body to acclimate: stay well-hydrated, eat lightly, avoid smoking and get plenty of rest. Seasonal conditions may make some facilities inaccessible in winter. Enjoy your visit!
