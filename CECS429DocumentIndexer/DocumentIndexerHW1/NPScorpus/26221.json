    "body": "The Village          Â    The significance of the workforce employed by Fort Vancouver has often been overlooked, and so have the grounds they inhabited. Fort Vancouver could not have fulfilled its role as the headquarters of the Columbia Department without its employees. These workers did not live inside the stockade, as the British officers and higher-ranking company employees did. Instead, Fort Vancouver had a distinct area for the living quarters of its lower-ranked, non-British employees known as \"the Village.\" The story of the Village has been divided into six sections.
