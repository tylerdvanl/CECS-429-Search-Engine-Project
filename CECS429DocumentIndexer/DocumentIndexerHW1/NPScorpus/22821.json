This photo is adapted from “Barosaurus, Galleries of the Age of Dinosaurs, ROM” by odtdevil, available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike license  About Barosaurus lentus: Barosaurus is a plant eater and the least common of all the sauropods (long-necked dinosaurs) found in the Carnegie Quarry. It is similar to Diplodocus, but has a longer neck and shorter tail. The forelimbs of Barosaurus are longer and more slender than those of the Diplodocus. Unfortunately, no one has ever found a Barosaurus skull so those on display are based on the skulls of other sauropods.      Why is Barosaurus lentus a superstar? There are only two full Barosaurus skeletons on display in the world. The only one on display in the United States is at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, NY. The display features an adult protecting its young from an attacking Allosaurus. Although this Barosaurus is a cast of the original bones found in the Carnegie Quarry, most of the real backbone is on display nearby.        Although we may never know what color dinosaurs were, this cast of Barosaurus skin shows us what the texture was like. The scale bar is 6 inches.   The most complete real Barosaurus skeleton on display is at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was also found in the Carnegie Quarry and acquired as part of a trade between museums. One of the boxes contained a surprise: an eight inch square imprint of Barosaurus skin attached to a limb bone! Dinosaur skin imprints are extremely rare but helpful in determining how dinosaurs might have looked. You can see the original skin imprint with the skeleton on display at the Royal Ontario Museum.      Jurassic Fact: The bones of the Barosaurus currently on display at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) were once scattered across three institutions. The AMNH traded with those institutions to get the entire skeleton. For more information: Visit the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Ontario, Canada where a Barosaurus lentus skeleton and skin imprint from Dinosaur National Monument are on display, or the American Museum of Natural History in New York, NY where a cast is on display. A cast of the skin impression is on display at the Quarry Exhibit Hall.",
