Park Service staff and outside researchers conduct research on the park's cultural resources. Recent research over the past few summers include copper artifact conservation and archeological fieldwork. Another recent project examined an archeological site located to the north of the Mound City Group to determine what type of site it is and when it dates to. The NPS Midwest Archeological Center (MWAC) often travels to the Hopewell Culture park sites to perform work such as excavations, geophysical surveys and topographical analysis.
