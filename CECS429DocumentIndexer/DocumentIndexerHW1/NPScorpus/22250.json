    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility     Blind \/ Low Vision              Blind \/ Low Vision       Mesa Verde National Park is accessible, with assistance, to our guests with visual impairment. However, we do not recommend visiting Cliff Palace, Balcony House, or Long House tours. Each of these sites has ladders, steep cliffs, rough footing, and other hazards to be negotiated in a short time. Service dogs can accompany their owners into Spruce Tree House or the self-guided sites on Wetherill Mesa. (The Wetherill Mesa sites are only open during the summer months.) Many artifacts like potsherds, cordage, bone tools, and other items are available for tactile investigation upon request at the Chapin Mesa Archeological Museum. The award-winning park video entitled \"Mesa Verde: Legacy of Stone and Spirit\" is available in the museum auditorium. Captions, audio description, and assistive listening are available.",
