The house at right-center would be located about where Pickett's Lane is today. It belonged to Frank Bryant, the son of Eliza Jakle from her first husband, an American Camp soldier who drowned in the lagoon. Also note the buck and rail fence crossing the beach and tideland and the fish trap camp below the bluff beyond. National Park Service         The barbed harpoon point, possibly fashioned from whale bone (far left), was excavated in 1946 at South Beach during a University of Washington field school conducted by Dr. Arden King. The other two harpoons were excavated at English Camp. The South Beach point is dated 500 BC-AD 200. Mike Vouri  Before there was the South Beach, known and loved by San Juan Islanders and visitors from around the world as a summer picnic ground and a spot to watch winter storms, there was the Salmon Bank. And for thousands of years, it was a place to make a living.  Spanish explorers during expeditions up the Strait of Juan de Fuca conducted 1790-1792 reported \"...an incredible quantity of salmon and numerous Indians.\"  Fifty years later, in October 1853, James Alden of the U.S. Coast Survey enthused about the maritime resources. \"Salmon abound in great quantities at certain seasons of the year, when the water in every direction seems to be filled with them…The Hudson's Bay Company has a fishing establishment at San Juan … where I am informed they have put up this season 600 barrels of salmon.\"  Not one month later Vancouver Island Gov. James Douglas wrote London that \"…These islands are exceedingly valuable, not only on account of their relative position to Vancouver Island, but also from the fact that their shores and inlets abound with salmon and other fish which form a productive export and an inexhaustible form of great wealth.\"  In 1858 Caleb Kennerly, a naturalist with the Northwest Boundary Survey, proclaimed the Salmon Bank as \"…perhaps the best fishing grounds on Puget Sound,\" where \"numerous bands of Indians\" seasonally encamped ashore. Those \"with the proper appliances\" for fishing could make money, he predicted. Geologically speaking, the Salmon Bank, running about a mile off South Beach, is a submerged ridge about 10 fathoms deep formed by moraines left by the glacier that receded starting about 18,000 years ago. But its cultural and economic impact reverberates to this day. Coast Salish and Northwest Coast peoples from across the region reef netted or trolled for salmon off the Salmon Bank and along the rocky shorelines of the San Juans for generations. Evidence of their ancestors date back as many 2,500 years and more. The five salmon runs—king (chinook), sockeye, cohoe (silver), pink and chum-- were so extensive that, short of ecological disaster or broken rhythm, the Indians could not miss. Four methods were used: Hook line, encirclement, entanglement and entrapment. Hook and line involved trolling outboard in deep water and was employed mainly for the immediate consumption or later the fresh fish market. The species were mainly Kings and silvers.          The Kanaka Village, once the home of Hawaiian Hudson's Bay Company employees, was also a traditional Indian fishing site. Several varieties of Indian and First nations canoes appear in this image. Click on the photo for a another view of the village taken by the U.S. Coast Survey in the 1890s. NPS  Traditional reef netting basically involved two canoes positioned in parallel with a net submerged between them, a bunt on one end. The object was to entrap the sock-eye salmon that feed in shallows. An artificial reef was created in deep water utilizing cedar-bark rope. \"Float lines\" (ropes interspersed with floats) running from both canoes held up the vertical sides of the \"reef, \" while a \"lead\" or bottom lines were anchored by stones. Cross-ropes, often intertwined with eel grass, fooled the salmon into thinking they were grazing the sea floor. The salmon swim up the reef and into the net. When a satisfactory number were corralled, the net was lifted and the fish spilled into one of the canoes. Each lift location was a resource owned by a family or clan who camped on the beach or the heights above near fresh water, usually in springs such as those seeping from the bluff at South , and well open to take advantage of direct sunlight to dry the fish. The most common shelters were mat houses, although the clan leader would stay in a plank house at the head of the village in front of the smoking racks. Native reefnetters found a ready market when Europeans arrived to settle in the 1840s. The Hudson's Bay Company established a salmon salting station on the island in 1851 to purchase fish from Indians. One blanket bought 60 fish, which The Company salted to the tune of some 2,000 to 3,000 barrels a season.         Coast Salish reef net crews operate off Stuart Island in this vintage photograph (see explanation of technique in accompanying text).

National Park Service  Most of the Indians interviewed by the Indian Claims Commission testimonies (Duwamish, et. al vs. USA) maintained that the fish traps and then non-Indian purse seiners displaced the Indians from these traditional fisheries.   Kennerly's \"appliances\" were profoundly realized in the San Juan Islands in 1892 with the introduction of fish traps, an adaptation of the Indian reef nets, which could trap thousands of sockeye salmon in a single season. Statehood in 1889 and the advance of the Transcontinental railroads into the region made it possible to ship canned fish across the country and the \"new\" industry worthy of investment. Big capital poured in bringing with it minds supple enough to adapt and improve upon native methods on a massive scale. Suddenly the reef net method of entrapment bred the fish trap, a stationary system designed to trap thousands of fish in one \"lift,\" and then preserving the catch through canning or salting. In principle, the fish-trap technique was similar to reef netting, corralling sockeye that gathered in eddies closer to shore that before could only be caught with seine or gill nets. Migrating fish encountered the 400-yard leads (giant sub-marine fences) and then swam along them into the \"hearts,\" a series of inverted \"Vs,\" that forced the fish into the \"pot\" or corral, a tarred web bag hung from pilings that could hold as many as 70,000 fish at a time (see inset illustration). From there they were directed into the spiller, a net from which the fish were dumped into an awaiting scow via a roller that compressed the net (much as one squeegees water from a window surface). The scows then hauled them to the cannery, which was established in 1894 in Friday Harbor. The state and seasonal weather rigidly policed and enforced trap operations. The traps and leads--as many as 12 off South Beach alone-- were installed in the spring. The piles that formed the leads were as much as 85 feet long (water ranged from 20 to 65 feet deep along the Salmon Bank) and were driven into the seabed by pile drivers with three-ton drop hammers. Hard-hat divers affixed the wire mesh to the piles, which also provided stable platforms for the trap mechanisms. The entire set-up was dismantled (the pile holes marked) and stored ashore over the winter. It was a frenzied operation once the sock-eye started running. The crews were based in a complex of dormitories, maintenance shops and a dining hall that could seat from 60 to 70 workers. The camp was located east of the today's main South Beach parking area, back from the driftwood line.       Fish are brailed from the spiller into a scow, which will then be towed to the cannery in Friday Harbor. Nearly all traps located in the Northern Straits and Puget Sound region were owned by corporations such as Pacific American Fisheries. Note the \"lead\" running back from the tug's smokestack off into the horizon (see caption above).  San Juan Historical Society         For more than 40 years the cannery provided seasonal work to anyone who wanted to work, such as these young women on the packing line. San Juan Historical Society  Men and women alike worked the cannery lines, packing cans by hand around the clock in the damp building where the noise could be deafening. From here the cans would proceed to the cooker. By 1912, the Friday Harbor Packing Company (located where today condominiums overlook the ferry dock) ranked fifth of 19 canneries in the greater Puget Sound\/Northern Straits region. Fish were pitched from scows onto the cannery floor and then sent through a machine that cut off heads and tails and gutted the fish for dicing and packing.   Early on, many of the workers were from the Philippine Islands or China. The 1900 U. S. Census listed nearly 50 Chinese in San Juan County. Some may have been smuggled into the country following the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. But anyone wanting a job could find one in the mid-1890s by simply walking down to the cannery office where the Washington State Ferries slip is located today.  On a typical day,  July 9, 1900, the cannery received 2,000 fish, resulting in 178 cases of sockeye, 35 cases of red spring salmon, and eight cases of white spring salmon. A few days later the catch was 5,790 sockeye and 540 spring salmon. But as efficient as these mechanisms were, they could only produce if the fish were there. Over an eight-year period, sockeye salmon traps brought in from 300 to 800 fish daily on average, peaking at about 2,000 fish per daily lift from mid-July to early August.   The year 1917 was especially notable sockeye season, but the difference in volume over a 48-hour period in July was astounding. For example:  A single trap, such as Pacific American Fisheries No. 549 on the Salmon Bank, bagged 28,000 sockeye in a single day's lift on July 29, but nabbed only 1,500 the next day and a mere 134 on July 31. Trap No. 557 caught 17,000 on the 29th, followed by 200 on the 30th and 31st. Trap No. 547 was a little more fortunate declining from 21,000 on the 30th to 2,000 on the 31st and 1,960 on August 1.  The grand total of all salmon for the three traps in the 1917 season was 101,788 (45,303 sockeye and 51,632 humpbacks) for No.. 557; 110, 571 (69,848 sockeye and 34,921 humpbacks) for No. 549; and 89, 043 (63,094 sockeye and 23,406 humpbacks) for No. 547. The balance of the tallies were silvers, chums, steelhead and spring salmon. But any way you look at it, July 29, 1917 was one the killer days in the history of these traps and made the season for their crews, and very likely the other nine on the Salmon Bank.       Pacific American Fisheries crews land their dories on South Beach following a shift on one of the 12 traps that were once located in the Strait of Juan de Fuca off the southern end of the Cattle Point peninsula. The photo was taken c. 1900. The posts in the background formed a barrier called a lead, which effectively steered spawning sockeye salmon into the fish traps. Mesh barriers were affixed to the piles by hard-hat divers. National Park Service         Fishermen’s tents line the bluff above the Salmon Bank as a blend of rowboats and gasoline-powered seiners ride at anchor at the Old Camp near Eagle Point. Farmers provided fresh water for the fishers who arrived each July intent on netting sockeye. The boxes aboard some of the craft house engines. San Juan Historical Museum  Just as technology gave the edge to the fish traps and the corporations who bankrolled them, it also brought fierce competition in the form of the purse seine fishery. By the late 19th century purse seine fishermen, Indian and non-Indian alike, were still rowing or sailing from shore in search of salmon schools to encircle with their nets. The work was arduous and the returns limited in the face of fish traps, even with tugboats towing them to the fishing grounds. It was not uncommon to seine from the beach and haul in the net with horse teams. However, in 1896 fishers introduced the 5- to 7- hp Frisco Standard gasoline engine, usually mounted forward and covered by a ventilated box. As with all new technologies, the engines were temperamental and skilled mechanics scarce. Fishermen either converted or lost the race to the Salmon Banks. Engines aside, the catch still had to be hauled from the sea by hand. The skiffs tied to the stern of this and other vessels would be rowed out from the seiner with one end of the net, while the seiner circled the school of fish and made the \"wrap.\" Today the skiffs, powered by marine engines, do the circling and reconnect with the seiner. A turntable mounted on the stern of the vessel facilitated pulling and stacking the net for the next layout. The table, pivoted in the center, could be swung 90 degrees to either side. The roller on the aft edge of the table made pulling easier.         A seiner, c. 1912, lays out a seine net while encircling a school of salmon. The skipper is at the wheel, looking aft to ensure that the net, stacked on the turntable astern, slips over the roller and into the water. The cork line at the top of the net floats on the surface, while the lead line sinks toward the bottom, creating a bowl-like purse that snares the salmon.  What was then done by hand is now done with power block.

Some are fishing by line, others in purse seiners. A few canoes also are in view, and all represent the myriad eras and interests of fishers on the Salmon Bank.   During the early days of the purse seine fishery on the Salmon Bank, the boats arrived from Puget Sound and crews set up housekeeping ashore because the boats were not large enough to house the crew. While a few brave souls risked the tides on the beach, most crews pitched their tents or threw up makeshift shacks on farms giving onto the bluffs. The farmers dug wells to provide fresh water for drinking, cooking and laundry. Long-time islander John Dougherty in the 1920s remembered such shacks, including a few at Grandma's Cove, site of the old Hudson's Bay Company landing, mainly occupied by Indians in nearly every cove along the Salmon Bank.   Following a record sock-eye run in 1913 (450,000 cases packed) a rock slide from construction at Hell Gate up the Fraser devastated the sock-eye spawning grounds,. The damage to the spawning grounds was repaired, but the huge sock-eye runs on Salmon Bank were significantly diminished. The fish trap corporations saw their profits begin to slide after 1917, the result of smaller returns of fish coupled with the $12,000 average annual installation of each trap. There was also the increased competition from the growing purse seining fleet . As NPS anthropologist Jacilee Wray's in her landmark study, The Salmon Bank: An Ethno-historic Compilation:  \"As the purse seiners became more competitive with the fish traps, animosity grew between the two factions, the seiners believing they were victims of a \"colonial empire\" because giant corporations such as Pacific American Fisheries (who bought the Friday Harbor Canning Company in 1899) owned everything from \"trap to can\" and seemed to care little about conservation of the resource.\" By the late 1920s, the purse seiners allied with sport fishers and the factions campaigned successfully for the 65-percent voter passage of Washington State Initiative 77 in 1934. Overnight the fish traps were gone and jobs were reduced dramatically on San Juan Island. Many cannery workers returned to family farms, raising crops for the pea cannery begun in 1922.  Those who could afford it bought purse seiners.       The classic \"woody\" station wagon dates this image to the late 1940s and the archaeological excavations at South Beach. Led by Dr. Arden King, this field school, under the auspices of the University of Washington, worked the first registered archaeological site in San Jaun County: 45SJ1. Archaeological field school have continued at the site over the years., particularly after San Juan Island National Historical Park was created in 1966. Burke Museum, University of Washington           Dr. Arden King's pits explored the bluffs above the shell midden, just west of Alaska Packer's Rock on the Salmon Banks Road at South Beach. Seattle Times  In the post-World War II era, the ancient Indian settlements on the Salmon Bank became the focus of archaeology field schools conducted by the University of Washington, the first in 1946-1947 under the direction of Dr. Arden King of the Tulane University. Some of King's pits can still be seen from Alaska Packer's Rock at the end of the Salmon Bank Road. He was followed in 1948 by Dr. Carroll Burroughs of Mesa Verde National Park.  When San Juan Island National Park was created in 1966, the federal government acquired all the land that encompassed fish-trap operations on the Salmon Bank off South Beach and archaeological activities continued. Some were under the direction of Dr. Julie Stein, an archaeologist, now director of the Burke Museum at the University of Washington.  A selection of pre-contact objects from all the field schools is on view in a case in the American Camp visitor center. Meanwhile, purse seining continues to this day on the Salmon Bank. Park visitors can still hear the roar of skiffs making sets and the clanking of the machinery reeling in the nets, but, save for a record sock-eye run in 2012,  it has never quite reached the volumes recorded in the early 1960s when the Seattle Times reported the salmon catch estimated at more than 1.5 million fish, worth $375,000 to the fishers and $1.25 million to the canners. Wray cites several factors, among them \"...the Boldt decision [which entitled Indian fishers to 50 perecent of the catch as per 19th century treaties], the proliferation of farmed salmon, and threatened and endangered stocks. Thanks to Jacilee Wray and NPS volunteer, Elizabeth Anderson, for their contributions to this page.       A group of fish trap workers gather around one of the shacks at the Salmon Banks Beach camp, which was located east of today's main parking area at South Beach. No one wanted for a job on San Juan Island during the fish trap era (1894-1934), but workers also came from all over the state. SAJH",
