I love the process of the painting, the joy of pushing paint or pastel around, developing lush color relationships and dramatic values. What initially attracts me to a subject are its shapes and values. I try to get beyond painting 'things' and concentrate on 'painting the painting'.\" During her residency, Dodd led a painting workshop.        Ceramic pieces by Sally Gierke, inspired by shapes of ripples and dunes.
