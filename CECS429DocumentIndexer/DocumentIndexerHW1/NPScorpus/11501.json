    "body": "Fire Ecology - Research       The objectives of fire research at PRNS are two-fold. The primary research objective is to collect and analyze data on specific biological resources in a scientifically rigorous manner to determine positive or adverse effects of prescribed burning on targeted resources. The secondary objective is to improve the knowledge base about prescribed fire and wildfire such that fire research will contribute both to science and to fire management. Research has been conducted by park staff and by outside researchers. It is the goal of the fire program at PRNS to continue in-park research efforts and to recruit high caliber research from outside organizations.      Reports  Harvey, Brian J., B. A. Holzman, and A.
