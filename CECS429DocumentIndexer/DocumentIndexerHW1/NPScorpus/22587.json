The Site Identification sign is used at the entrance to a historic site, segment, or interpretive facility, so that the public knows when they have arrived at a place on the national historic trail. These signs will be located at the entrance to the property and because each property is unique, these signs are site specific. This sign can be added to an existing sign (see example above) or customized with images or logos. Each sign will require working directly with the landowner and NTIR office to determine the requirements for this sign.      Other Sign Web Pages:  Auto Tour Route Local Tour Route Crossing To Original Route  Original Route Original Route Next XX Miles Original Route BEGIN Original Route END Historic Site Name",
