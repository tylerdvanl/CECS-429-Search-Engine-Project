Many volunteer opportunities exist at Fort Donelson National Battlefield. In 2014, over 125 volunteers donated 3587.50 hours and worked independently and alongside park employees in interpretive services, living history, maintenance projects and natural resources. These individuals play an important role providing services that support our park mission.   We look for dedicated, reliable individuals who are able to work a flexible schedule that may involve weekdays, weekends, morning, or afternoon.   One trailer pad for personal travel homes is available for resident volunteers who are required to work 32 hours per week for 6 weeks, pending approval of the park superintendent.The schedule and amount of time worked will be negotiated to benefit the park and the volunteer.   Training for most positions is provided. Uniforms are provided for Visitor Center assistant, Interpretive assistant and maintenance volunteers who work with the public. For more information about the Fort Donelson NB volunteer program, please contact the Park Volunteer Coordinator.",
