    "body": "Maps      Â    Explore using this area map. Stop by the Independence Visitor Center at 6th and Market Streets on the day of your visit to pick up paper maps. Download Independence National Historical Park's FREE mobile app, \"NPS Independence\", to use for trip planning and on-site navigating. The app's map includes the Thaddeus Kosciuszko National Memorial as well as the surrounding area. It's a gem!  Philadelphia is a city of neighborhoods. The Thaddeus Kosciuszko National Memorial is located in Society Hill, not too far from the historic buildings on Independence Square or from the youthful buzz of excitement on South Street. Numerous city and private museums are neighbors, like the Polish American Cultural Center. A few Philadelphia icons, like the \"Rocky steps\" at the Philadelphia Museum of Art are much farther away in the Parkway district.",
