    "body": "Biking & Mountain Biking          Â    Bicycles can be used on all park roads that are open to public vehicular traffic. They can also be used on routes that have been designated for bicycle use in developed areas such as the path between the visitor center and the Harmony Borax Works. They are not allowed on closed roads, service roads, off roadways, in the wilderness, or on any trails. Riding a bicycle abreast of another bicycle on our narrow roads is dangerous and is also prohibited. Death Valley has more than 785 miles of roads including hundreds of miles suitable for Mountain Biking. Click on the highlighted link for a list of recommended routes of differing difficulties.",
