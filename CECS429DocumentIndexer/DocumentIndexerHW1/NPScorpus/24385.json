    "body": "Enabling Legislation       An Act of Congress designated this park in 1917, originally naming it Mount McKinley National Park. Congress \"established [the park] as a game refuge,\" and instructed park managers to craft \"regulations being primarily aimed at the freest use of the said park for recreation purposes by the public and for the preservation of animals, birds, and fish and for the preservation of the natural curiosities and scenic beauties thereof.\" (cf. Sections 5 & 6 of the Act of 1917, linked below).  Over the years, additional Acts impacted the size and management of the park, most significantly the passage of ANILCA (Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act) in 1980. The passage of ANILCA tripled the park's size, and renamed it Denali National Park and Preserve.  Links below will take you to other government websites that more fully describe these various Acts of Congress.       Read the enabling legislation in: U.S. Statutes at Large, Vol. 39, Part 1, Chap. 121, pp. 938-39. \"An Act To establish the Mount McKinley National Park, in the Territory of Alaska.\" S. 5716; Public Act No. 353  Or, download an annotated extract of the Denali-specific information from this Act and an extract of the 1932 Act which modified the boundaries of the park.       Learn more about the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA):   State of Alaska's ANILCA resources Full text of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act  Learn more about the park's foundation statement and various management plans in the park's planning portfolio.",
