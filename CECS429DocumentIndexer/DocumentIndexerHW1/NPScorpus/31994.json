If inclement weather is upon us, please be sure to check the status of road conditions around the park.      Heat and Sun Hot and humid weather is typical during the summer months. Make sure to bring water to keep hydrated and take frequent breaks to prevent heat-related illnesses. The sun can be intense, so wear sunscreen and bring along a hat and a lightweight long-sleeve shirt. Winter Weather  During the winter months, prolonged exposure to cold weather can cause hypothermia.  Be sure to dress in layers to avoid this.  The cold can also cause snow and ice to build up on sidewalks and steps.  Please be sure to use caution when traversing on paths, sidewalks and stairs within and around the park as they may be slippery. Bees & Biting Insects Bees and other biting insects can be found in and around the park's grassy areas throughout the spring and summer months. Closed toe shoes and insect repellent may help prevent stings and other insect bites.",
