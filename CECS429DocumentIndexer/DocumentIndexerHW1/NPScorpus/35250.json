Call to Action Projects      Victorian Dancing in a Modern World  The Arlington House Victorian Dance Society is an award winning group that is dedicated to advancing the knowledge and technique of Victorian Dance from the Civil War Era.  It is not only a beautiful art form, but is also a tangible connection to the Historic Period that Arlington House interprets. The Group is a corps of volunteers, most of whom started as mansion docents at Arlington House with an initial interest in the history of the site and time period that evolved.

Lee Memorial has been the site of a developing program over the last few years that has gone through a transformation from being a basic demonstration garden that gave visitors an opportunity to see the different food stuffs that would have been used during the historic period to a garden that produces a bounty for a local food bank.

Arlington House incorporates this theme into all interpretive programming. A special emphasis was put on it in 2012 and 2014. 2012 was the anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation and the manumission of the enslaved people on the Arlington Plantation.

Read more   Real World History Lesson   Each year we bring on student interns from West Springfield High School in Fairfax, VA. Students are introduced to the history of the site and the principles of public history. They receive training and spend 100 hours working with the public. The skills they learn are both invaluable to their understanding of how to interpret history and how to communicate difficult subjects to diverse groups of people. Many of those students have then been hired by the NPS. Read more",
