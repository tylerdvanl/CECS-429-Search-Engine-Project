    "body": "Landforms               This unit introduces students to Geomorphology which is the study of landforms. They will learn about common landforms and how they are created.      UNIT GOALS:  Students will see how river channels change through repetition of experiments with different variables. Students will be shown how different valleys are formed. Instructors will explain how fan shaped landforms are made. Students will be shown how rocks react to different tectonic forces. Instructors will explain how plateaus are formed. Using all information about landforms, students will play the classic memory game.       UNIT ACTIVITIES: 1. Changing Channels in Midstream: Uses experiments to see how different variables affect sediment movement forming stream channels: straight, meandering and braided. 2. Varying Valleys: Uses experiments to show how three valley types are formed: U-valleys, V-valleys and plain valleys. 3. Deposit a slice of pie: Uses experiments to demonstrate how triangle shaped landforms are created: alluvial fan, delta, mud and debris flows. 4. Pushing and Pulling Mountains: Demonstrates how some mountain ranges are created by extension and compression forces acting on the crust. 5. Planar Plateaus: Allows students to see how flat-topped mountains are formed. 6. Earth's pimple problem: Teaches about the three types of volcanoes and what causes them to form. 7. Remembering Landforms: Is the culminating activity of this unit. It uses pictures, landform names and processes that form each landform to play a memory match game.       GEODETECTIVE Home - - Landforms Kid's Page Contact our Education Outreach Specialist here.",
