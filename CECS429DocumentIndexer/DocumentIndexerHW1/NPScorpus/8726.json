    "body": "Community Partners       Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore has joined with many local businesses as \"Community Partners\" to better serve visitors to the area.   “With about a half-million people coming every year to enjoy America’s first national lakeshore, we recognize that there are many businesses and organizations in our gateway communities that are instrumental in providing knowledge and information about the park to visitors,” Superintendent Jim Northup explained.   “While we encourage all park visitors to visit our website before their visit, stop at the Interagency Visitor Center in Munising, or talk to our staff at our three other visitor centers or in the field, we recognize that many visitors get their information from a wide variety of local sources,\" Northup added. \"The Community Partner Program enables the lakeshore to work more closely with, provide better information to, and acknowledge the efforts of these partner locations.”   Many local motels, restaurants and other businesses in communities adjacent to the park are Community Partners. Participating business locations have a comprehensive reference package of information about the park and a counter-top display and window-display placard identifying that location as a Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore Community Partner.   “Through this program we believe that we can do an even better job of making visitors aware of all the wonderful things there are to do and see in the national lakeshore and the surrounding area,” Northup said, “and strengthen our communications and relationships with our neighbors.”   For more information about the Community Partner Program, please contact the national lakeshore at 387-2607.
