During this 90 minute tour, we'll visit sites of identity, faith, and community in downtown Boston and the North End and consider questions of transition, permanence, and belonging: How did the Irish and Irish American experience inform their sense of selves? What role did religion and the power of American democracy have in shaping their character? How did the Kennedys and the Fitzgeralds view the communities that made up the city of Boston? How were they shaped by the communities they lived in and in turn, how was the city transformed by them? This tour is offered Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays July 1 through September 3, 2016.  Tour departs from the Boston National Historical Park Visitor Center at Faneuil Hall at 10:15. Reservations are recommended; email us or call 617-566-7937.
