Becky Oakes and John Hennessy will be the presenters.   Please note the earlier start time at 6:30, necessitated by the shorter days in mid-August.    The tour will begin behind the Fredericksburg Battlefield Visitor Center, at 1013 Lafayette Boulevard, Fredericksburg, 22401. The program will explore the chaos of wartime burials at Fredericksburg and how the United States War Department organized a special Burial Corps to find, exhume, and re-inter Union Civil War dead in the years immediately following the War. Those efforts resulted in the creation of the Fredericksburg National Cemetery.    For additional information, call (540) 693-3200    Download a PDF of the press release",
