The monument was created from the acquisition of private land that had been farmed and logged altering the native vegetation mosaic. Results of monument vegetation surveys combined with information from federal land surveys show that a mosaic of forest, savanna, and prairie covered the monument. Prairie and savanna dominated ridges and south facing slopes. Forests pockets were likely found on north facing slopes and in the river floodplain.
