    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility     Service Animals              Service Animals       The Department of Justice published revised final regulations implementing the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) for title II (State and local government services) and title III (public accommodations and commercial facilities) on September 15, 2010, in the Federal Register. These requirements, or rules, clarify and refine issues that have arisen over the past 20 years and contain new, and updated, requirements, including the 2010 Standards for Accessible Design (2010 Standards).   This publication provides guidance on the term \"service animal\" and the service animal provisions in the Department's new regulations.    Beginning on March 15, 2011, only dogs are recognized as service animals under titles II and III of the ADA.  A service animal is a dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for a person with a disability.    Service animals are defined as dogs that are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities. Examples of such work or tasks include guiding people who are blind, alerting people who are deaf, pulling a wheelchair, alerting and protecting a person who is having a seizure, reminding a person with mental illness to take prescribed medications, calming a person with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) during an anxiety attack, or performing other duties. Service animals are working animals, not pets. The work or task a dog has been trained to provide must be directly related to the person's disability. Dogs whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as service animals under the ADA.    Wind Cave National Park's Superintendent's Compendium states:   36 CFR 2.15 - Pets: (a)(1) All caves, hiking trails, and backcountry areas are closed to pets. Service dogs are allowed on paved cave trails if medically necessary.  All public use buildings are closed to pets except for service dogs.",
