There is something for everyone!       Eating If you are looking for a taste of Philly, try a cheesesteak or hoagie.  Looking for a colonial dining experience?  Satisfy your palate at City Tavern, a reconstruction of the tavern John Adams described as the \"most genteel\" in America.  In the Independence Visitor Center, you'll find Cafe Independence and the Independence Mall Cafe (open seasonally).  Speak to a Visitor Services Representative in the visitor center for more information on dining.  Tip:  Enjoy a Philly soft pretzel with yellow mustard - we eat them for breakfast, lunch, dinner and anytime in between!       Sleeping A list of accommodations in the Philadelphia area shows the numerous options for lodging.  The Thomas Bond House, a restored 18th century home now open as a Bed and Breakfast, sits adjacent to Welcome Park on the eastern end of Independence National Historical Park.",
