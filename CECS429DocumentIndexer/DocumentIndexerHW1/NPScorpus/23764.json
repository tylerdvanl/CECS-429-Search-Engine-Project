Photo by Sally King  Opportunities to cross-country ski, snowshoe, and hike may be found in the Upper Frijoles area of the monument located off of Highway 4, near Forest Service Road 289 (Dome Road). There are four trails - the Cerro Grande Trail, the Alamo Boundary Trail, and the two Upper Frijoles loop trails (one is 2.4 miles round-trip while the other is 5 miles round-trip). Trails are open during daylight hours only. Pets are not permitted. Please pack out all trash. Snowshoe users and hikers are asked to stay to the side of the ski trail. Seasonal Conditions Snow volume varies from year to year so call the visitor center (505-672-3861 x 517) for current conditions. The ski and snowshoe season usually lasts from mid-November to mid-March. The trails are open all year to hiking.        The Upper Frijoles Trails are also open to snowshoe use.  Please stay beside the ski trail. Photo by Sally King",
