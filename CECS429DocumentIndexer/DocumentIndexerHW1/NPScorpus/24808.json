    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility             Accessibility       Denali is largely wilderness without trails, designated by Congress to remain a \"primitive\" area in many respects. The National Park Service strives to make the park as universally accessible as possible. However, extra obstacles will be encountered because of the remote, wilderness nature of this special place.  If your questions concerning accessibility are unanswered after reading the below information, please contact us at 907 683-2294 [TDD users call 907 683-9649] or email us.  Find information on:     Physical \/ Mobility  Deaf \/ Hearing Loss     Service Animals Blind \/ Low Vision    Cognitive General Information            Also, learn about the The America the Beautiful National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Access Pass -- or simply, the Access Pass -- which provides a wide range of discounts on activities and services when you visit federal lands.      Road Travel in Denali  Unique among many national parks, Denali has but one road. Access along the first 15 miles of the road is possible by any private vehicle; travel on the rest of the 92-mile long road is largely restricted to bus trips, run by a concessioner.   While the National Park Service and our concessioner make every effort to facilitate visitors with disabilities, in rare circumstances an individual's needs may not be met by the accommodations that are available on our shuttle and tour buses. Those individuals may apply for a road travel permit, which would allow them to drive part or all of the Denali Park Road in their own vehicle.  Download the application for a road travel permit. Feel free to continue your responses in a separate word processing document.   Feel free to contact us with specific questions about this process.  Applicants must be able to explain to park managers why accommodations on the bus system are insufficient to meet personal needs. Adequate time is needed to go through this process, so we appreciate hearing from you well in advance of your visit.
