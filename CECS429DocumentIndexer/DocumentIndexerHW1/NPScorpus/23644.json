There are a number of species that vary greatly in color and appearance.  All robber flies are predaceous, lying in wait for victims.        Some Robber Flies camouflage themselves by looking very much like a bee. Photo by Sally King  Robber flies are capable of capturing and consuming insects much larger than themselves.  Even in their larval form they often are predaceous on other insects.       CAUTION.  Don't handle Robber Flies.  They can deliver a very painful sting. Photo by Sally King",
