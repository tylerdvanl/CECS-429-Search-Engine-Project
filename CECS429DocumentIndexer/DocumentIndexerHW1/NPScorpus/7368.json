    "body": "Freedom Of Information Act        The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) gives you the right to access any Bighorn Canyon, National Park Service (NPS), or Department of the Interior (DOI) records unless the information in those records is protected by one or more of the nine exemptions (reasons an agency may withhold records from a requester) and there is a sound legal basis to withhold them. If you are seeking general information about Bighorn Canyon, you may wish to explore other pages of this website or feel free to contact the park. The information you are seeking may already be available via the Internet, at park Visitor Centers, or by simply calling 406-666-3305-822-5234, mailing, or e-mailing your request to the park. If it is not, you will need to submit a written FOIA request (there is no official request form, just send us a letter describing the records you desire) to:  Superintendent Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area 5 Avenue B, P.O. Box 7458 Fort Smith, MT 59035  You may also submit FOIA requests to the NPS or the DOI. If you have questions on what information is available without submitting a FOIA request or where it may be located, contact one of the NPS or DOI FOIA Contacts. Our responsibility is to provide you with copies of the documents you are entitled to receive under the law. We want to work with you to achieve that goal.
