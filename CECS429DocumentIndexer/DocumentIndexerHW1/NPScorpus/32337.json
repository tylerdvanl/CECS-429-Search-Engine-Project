    "body": "Paved Paths       There is a flat, paved, 0.36-mile, self-guiding loop trail through the original mission site. There are several benches located along the trail. A 370-foot, paved path leads from the Visitor Center, up a small rise, to where the Whitmans are buried in a mass grave. A paved trail at the base of the hill leads to a marker for the Whitman's biological daughter, Alice Clarissa Whitman, who drowned at the age of 2. A monument to the Whitmans stands at the top of a hill. There are two paths to the top. Both are paved, but are very steep. There is a bench half-way up on both paths.",
