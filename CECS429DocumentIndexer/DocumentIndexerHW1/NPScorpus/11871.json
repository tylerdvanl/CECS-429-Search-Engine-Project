Wildland fire and fire suppression efforts further add to the complexity. It is important that good communication between cooperating resources is pre-established, especially during times of fast moving Santa Ana wind driven fires. In order to protect both the natural environment and our communities, all agencies must work together.  Below are links to sources of wildland fire information:    Sources of Wildland Fire Information Inci-web - an interagency all-risk incident information management system  Sit-report - an incident management situation report from the National Interagency Coordination Center Local Level Cooperators Los Angeles City Fire Department Los Angeles County Fire Department Ventura County Fire Department       Sources of Wildland Fire Science Information California Fire Science Consortium - a network of fire science researchers, managers, and outreach specialists tasked with improving science outreach and knowledge exchange between California fire researchers, managers, policymakers, and private landowners. USGS Southern California Wildfire Risk Scenario – a multidisciplinary project that seeks to clarify which factors drive fire risks to residential communities through the analysis of housing, powerline, vegetation, topographic and wind patterns at Southern California’s wildland-urban interface (WUI).
