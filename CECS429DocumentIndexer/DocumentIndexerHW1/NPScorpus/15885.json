NPF helps individual parks attract philanthropic gifts by encouraging those who feel a deep appreciation for a park to express their support.  Making a donation to the Lincoln Boyhood Memorial Fund at the National Park Foundation means your gift will be used to support the park and its programs.  Your gift will make a difference.
