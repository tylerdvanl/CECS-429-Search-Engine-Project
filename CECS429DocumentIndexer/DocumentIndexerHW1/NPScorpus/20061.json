NPS Photo    Cumberland’s 18-mile undeveloped beach is one of the most important loggerhead sea turtle nesting areas in Georgia.  Each year it accounts for 25 to 30 percent of the statewide nesting total.  In the last 3½  seasons, Cumberland has produced over 1,800 nests.  Loggerhead sea turtles are listed as a Federally endangered species.  The park’s sea turtle monitoring program utilizes interns who patrol the beach from May through October each year, locating nests; monitoring those nests; protecting them from tidal washovers and predation; and finally inventorying them after hatching to evaluate success.  The interns provide a much needed service to the park and gain valuable experience in their field of study that helps with future employment opportunities.     For over a decade, the park has funded the annual summer internship program in partnership with the Student Conservation Association.  2013 budget realities impacted the long running program by reducing the number of interns serving in this vital monitoring program.
