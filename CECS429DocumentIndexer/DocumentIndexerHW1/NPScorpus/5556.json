Be careful and look both ways at the intersections on Old Battleground and New Garden Roads.  Bicycle Helmet Law On 10\/1\/2001, the CHILD BICYCLE SAFETY ACT went into effect as enacted by the North Carolina General Assembly. Here is what it means to you and your child:   All children below the age of 16 must wear a protective bicycle helmet that fits well and is fastened securely to the child's head using the straps of the helmet while they are operating a bicycle.   This law also applies to children under the age of 16 who are passengers on bicycles being operated by another person. This does not apply to tricycles.   This requirement applies to all public roadways, public bicycle paths, or other public maintained right-of-ways.   Any parent\/guardian found responsible for violation of the Child Helmet Safety Law may be ordered to pay a civil fine of up to ten dollars ($10).",
