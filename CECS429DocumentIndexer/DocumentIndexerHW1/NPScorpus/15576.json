The National Park Service's official volunteer program is called Volunteers-in-Parks, or VIP.  Authorized in 1970 it's a way for the Park Service to accept and use volunteer help from public.    Volunteers can be used in any area of a park's operation and can do almost any type of work so long as that work:   Would not otherwise get done during a particular fiscal year because of funding or personnel limitations.   Allows paid employees to accomplish work that would not otherwise get done during a particular fiscal year because of funding or personnel limitations.   Does not result in the displacement of any paid employees.",
