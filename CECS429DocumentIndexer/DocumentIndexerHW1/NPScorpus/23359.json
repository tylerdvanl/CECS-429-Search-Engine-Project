NPS Photo  Heritage Garden and Native Plants Walk The Heritage Garden and the Native Plants Walk are both inside the shady and historic picnic area. Traditional crops like corn, beans, squash, sunflowers, and gourds are grown by park staff and volunteers. Tours are offered in the summer. The Native Plants Walk is located on the west side of the picnic area near the parking lot. Take a quick stroll and see the wild plants that people in the Southwest have relied on for thousands of years.        A pedestrian bridge over the Animas River is part of the nationally designated Old Spanish National Historic Trail that runs between Aztec Ruins National Monument and the City of Aztec's historic downtown. NPS Photo  Old Spanish National Historic Trail to Downtown Aztec The Old Spanish Trail was the first recorded trade caravan from Santa Fe, NM all the way to Los Angeles, CA.  The first journey was led by Antonio Armijo in 1829, and it was so difficult the traders never took that exact same route again!  As you can imagine, it is tricky to find the trail on the ground today, and we really don't know how close the caravan actually came to Aztec Ruins.  Today you can follow the nationally desginated trail from the picnic area, over the bridge across the Animas RIver, and into historic downtown Aztec for shopping and dining.
