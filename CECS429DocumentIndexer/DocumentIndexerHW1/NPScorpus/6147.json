    "body": "Park Fun          Â    The Valley Quest program, created in the 1990's, combines elements of a treasure hunt- rhyming clues and maps- with the chance for children of all ages to learn more about the area that they live in and places to which they travel with family and school groups. At the end of each hunt, searchers will find a hidden box containing more information about the search site, a rubber stamp, a sign-in journal, and pencil, so that everyone can sign his or her name.  The Saint-Gaudens' quest is new to the Valley Quest program.  Click on the link below to find a copy of the clue sheet, as well as more information about the Valley Quest program.
