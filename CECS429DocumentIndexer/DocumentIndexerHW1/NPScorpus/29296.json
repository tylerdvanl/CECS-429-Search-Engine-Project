The act \"declared to be the policy of the United States that certain selected rivers of the Nation, which with their immediate environments, possess outstandingly remarkable scenic, recreational, geologic, fish and wildlife, historic, cultural, or other similar values, shall be preserved in free-flowing condition, and that they and their immediate environments shall be protected for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations.\" Each designated river in the national system is to be managed in a way that protects and enhances the values that prompted its designation. In 1978, Congress used the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate the Upper Delaware River as a unit of national park system and a component of the national wild and scenic river system. Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River is a partnership of individuals; private landowners; and local, state, and federal governments working to protect the river, its environment, and the communities in the valley.Management Goals for Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River(4 pages, PDF | 1.50 MB) The Final River Management Plan (224 pages, PDF | 19.7 MB) Project Review Workbook (137 pages, PDF | 5.90 MB) Superintendent's Compendium (13 pages, PDF | 2.20 MB)  Delaware River Basin Wild and Scenic River Values (42 pages, PDF | 4.94 MB) Wild & Scenic Rivers Brochure (4 pages, PDF | 1.24 MB) Wild & Scenic Rivers Landowner Guide (8 pages, PDF | 1.77 MB) Foundation Document - February 2014 (80 pages, PDF | 6.68 MB)   Foundation Document Overview - February 2014 (8 pages, PDF | 1.31 MB) State of the Park Reports 2011 State of the Park Report (21 pages, PDF | 1.8 MB) 2010 State of the Park Report (10 pages, PDF | 579 KB) 2009 State of the Park Report (15 pages, PDF | 1.21 MB) 2008 State of the Park Report (10 pages, PDF | 1.17 MB) 2007 State of the Park Report (11 pages, PDF | 413 KB) 2006 State of the Park Report (8 pages, PDF | 242 KB)",
