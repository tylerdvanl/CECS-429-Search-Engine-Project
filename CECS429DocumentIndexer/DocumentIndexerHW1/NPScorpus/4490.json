    "body": "Geocaching              Geocaching is a real-world outdoor treasure hunt. Players locate hidden containers, called geocaches, using GPS-enabled devices and share their experiences online. If you are new to geocaching, you may want to begin by checking out the official Guide to the Game.  Players may register a free account with Geocaching.com to seek caches and log entries about those they've found, but it is not necessary. The information needed to find Everglades Restoration Geocaches is freely available on these pages.      REMINDER         Dry Tortugas National Park is currently developing geocaches for placement in the park. These Geocaches will be for the enjoyment of visitors. Please note that the placement of unauthorized caches on lands managed by the National Park Service remains generally prohibited.             Questions or Comments? For additional questions, or to report trouble with any of the cache containers, please contact the park's geocache administrator. Please also use this form to share ideas and comments on how to improve this visitor experience. And if you are an account holder on Geocaching.com, you can always leave a log note or find us at EvergladesNPS!",
