The Act describes one study route for the Pony Express National Historic Trail, a 20-mile southern alternate route between Wathena and Troy, Kansas. Other trails in the feasibility study include California National Historic Trail, Oregon National Historic Trail, and Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail.
