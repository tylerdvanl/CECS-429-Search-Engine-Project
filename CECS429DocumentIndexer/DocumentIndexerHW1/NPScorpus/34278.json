Volunteers are also needed to staff the historic Stone House, a pre-war tavern used as an aide station during both Battles of Manassas.        Trail Maintenance  Manassas National Battlefield Park contains more than 40 miles of trails, over half of which are open to horseback riding. The park works closely with two volunteer organizations to perform routine trail maintenance, combat erosion, and address sustainability issues. Hiking trails at the park are maintained with the assistance of the Blue & Gray Trail Crew, and bridle trails are maintained with the assistance of the Battlefield Equestrian Society.
