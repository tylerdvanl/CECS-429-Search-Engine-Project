However, visitors who wish to visit the prison and island grounds must secure reservations. For over a decade, the National Park Service has implemented a reservation system, which is much different from the ways past generations accessed the Alcatraz Island. The National Park Service strongly recommends making advanced ticket reservations. Reservations secured far enough in advance allow visitors to visit and also eliminate the need to wait in line to purchase tickets.  Alcatraz tickets are all inclusive. The ticket price includes the ferry transportation service provided by Alcatraz Cruises, the cellhouse audio tour provided by the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, and the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act fee. For additional information on schedules, prices, and to purchase tickets in advance (tickets are made available about 90 days in advance) please visit the Alcatraz Cruises website. The cellhouse audio tour is available in English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Dutch, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, and Mandarin. It is also available in Braille in English. If you would like to bypass the audio tour experience, please contact a supervisor in the cellhouse bookstore for a refund.      Click Here to Make a Reservation Now        Ferries are run by Alcatraz Cruises Alcatraz Cruises  Purchase Ferry Tickets Alcatraz Cruises is the official source for ferry tickets to Alcatraz Island.
