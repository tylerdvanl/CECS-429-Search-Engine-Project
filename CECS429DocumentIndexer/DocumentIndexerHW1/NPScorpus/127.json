The U.S. Coast Guard has established and maintains the marked routes within the park. Along these routes, a \"safe\" channel is marked with Nuns (red conical shaped markers) and Cans (green square shaped markers) and unusual rock hazards (white and orange square shaped markers). Caution is advised when traveling the waters of Voyageurs National Park. The national park service advises NOT to solely rely on GPS units, carry good navigational charts. Not all rock hazards are marked due to changing water levels. Navigational maps DO NOT display all rock hazards and not all rock hazards are marked due to changing water levels throughout the season the location of which rocks are a hazard can change. For an overview of the routes, you can examine the National Geographic Campsite Map on our Maps page. This map is not intended for navigational use rather for identify and locating campsites within the park.      Navigational Management of Voyageurs' Waterways United States Coast Guard Buoys can occasionally float off course. Make sure to check your navigational charts and\/or GPS units for the correct routes. If a Nun or Can floats off the directed course, usually due to high winds, contact the U.S.C.G. Lamplighters. USCG: 218-720-5286 Rainy Lake Lamplighter:  Tyson Whitbeck, 218-324-2840  Kabetogama, Namakan, and Sand Point Lakes Lamplighter:   Tom Dougherty, 218-286-5751  National Park Service The National Park Service does not mark the navigational routes. Please contact the U.S.C.G. for questions regarding navigational buoys, see above numbers. In the case of low water levels the National Park Service may place extra buoys on the waterways for safe navigation. If you have a question regarding the rock markers, please email the Chief of Visitor Protection or call park headquarters at 218-283-6600.      Purchasing Lake Navigational Maps At least one good navigational chart\/map of the area in which you will be traveling is essential for a safe and enjoyable park experience. DO NOT rely solely on digital devices such as GPS units or cell phones - connections in the park are unreliable. To purchase maps:  The park carries some navigational maps onsite in the visitor center bookstores. Many local area establishments carry navigational maps. Find one close to your location through the help of Destination Voyageurs National Park       GPS Navigation The use of GPS devises to navigate has become increasingly popular. The park provides a list of GPS sites in several formats for assistance in locating specific campsites, houseboat sites, day use sites, and visitor destination sites on the waterways. Always bring a good navigation chart\/map and know how to read it when on the water. This GPS information is NOT for waterway navigation.      Boating in Canada If you plan on crossing the international waterways into Canada, know the regulations before you go. Check-out Canadian boating requirements on the Ontario website.      Emergencies The local sheriff's office, MN DNR, local businesses, and the National Park Service monitor Marine Band Radio Channel 16 in case of emergencies.
