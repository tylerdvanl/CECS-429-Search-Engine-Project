    "body": "Explore This Park    Get Involved     Support Your Park             Support Your Park      The management and staff of the Castillo de San Marcos National Monument need your help.  As guardians of one of our nation’s great treasures, park employees hope you will enjoy your visit.  We ask that during your visit you pause to consider the impact you are having on the park and consider ways to help us preserve all the park has to offer. It’s easy to help; here’s how:  Don’t litter. Pack out your trash. Clean up where others have not. Reduce, reuse and recycle (recycling centers have been set up throughout the park for your convenience). Use designated pathways. Keep off historic walls and cannons. Don’t pick at the fragile walls of the fort.  These simple actions on your part will reduce the time we need to spend cleaning and repairing areas of the park.  This will allow us to focus our efforts on more critical and interesting endeavors. We want you to know that we have taken many steps to making the park as energy efficient and ecologically friendly as possible.  But it is an ever progressing effort.  If you see any way in which we may be able to reduce operating expenses or provide a more environmentally responsible experience, please let us know.

Enjoy, but do not destroy!       Donate to the Park You can always donate money directly to the park. All donations are greatly appreciated. Money received through general donations is used to support the educational and interpretive activities that we offer. These include, among others, the volunteers who present the living history demonstrations and the Junior Ranger program.
