Anne St. Charles   Â    The park consists of about 26 acres of which approximately 80% is coastal wetland. This wetland area is dominated by intertidal mangrove forest with associated shoreline along the Manatee River. The remaining area is mostly upland pine flatlands and mixed hardwood forest. An area of approximately 11 acres adjacent to the park known as Riverview Pointe is managed by Manatee County and consists primarily of upland sand pine scrub. The mangrove forest is generally dominated by black mangroves, a tree that is usually found away from high energy shorelines or large tidal variations, and buttonwoods, a tree often found along the edges of mangroves. Red mangroves, typically associated with the edge of the forest adjacent to open water, occur here, but are not overly abundant. White mangroves also are not common, but are found in the somewhat higher elevation mangrove areas. The coastal strand occurs as a narrow strip of vegetation between the mangrove forest and the open sandy beach along the Manatee River shoreline. The strand community is shrubby with buttonwood as the dominant shrub, while the ground cover is made up of salt-tolerant herbs, such as yellow joyweed, sea oxeye and sea purslane. The central area of the park, in the vicinity of the visitor center and parking, is primarily a cleared and landscaped space that is maintained for aesthetics and visitor use. The area is surrounded on three sides by mangroves and on the north by the Manatee River. As you enter the park live oak trees line the driveway and parking area, while several large gumbo limbo trees form a canopy adjacent to the visitor center. The large grassy mall within the parking area is planted with St. Augustine grass, as is the grassy area around the visitor center.
