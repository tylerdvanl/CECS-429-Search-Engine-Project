During the battle, the Confederate attacks proceeded over the top of Brooks Hill, across what is now I-270, and met stiff resistance from Brigadier General James Ricketts’ veterans in the fields of the Thomas Farm. The infantry attack stretched from the river, out of sight to the left, almost to Baker Valley Road. After several hours of intense fighting, the Union troops gave way near the Georgetown Pike. They retreated past the Gambrill Mill and over the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad on their way to Baltimore. The Brooks Hill Vista may be reached by following the Brooks Hill Loop, which starts and ends at the Worthington House. The trail leads up through the woods to the edge of a corn field and is the best location to get a bird’s eye view of the battlefield through the changing seasons.",
