Ukiyo-e was a genre of Japanese art that flourished in the 18th and 19th centuries. Its popularity coincided with the end of the feudal era and the rise of the more modern, industrialized Meiji era in Japan. Among Yoshitoshi's finest work is his series, One Hundred Aspects of the Moon, completed during the last years of his life. The series of one hundred prints depicts scenes from Japanese and Chinese history and mythology, with most of the images featuring a moon.  The twenty-eight prints in the collection of Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park are from the One Hundred Aspects of the Moon series. They were a gift from the family of Sho Nemoto to Elizabeth Billings in 1898. Sho Nemoto was a Japanese national who briefly lived with the Billings family in the late 1880s. Frederick Billings sponsored Sho Nemoto's education at the University of Vermont, which he attended along with Billings' own son. Frederick Billings' last words to Sho Nemoto, \"I wish you to be useful in Japan,\" were a source of inspiration when he returned to Japan, dedicating the rest of his life to religion, education and social change. He was elected to the Japanese Diet in 1899, where he introduced a bill to establish free universal public education, and bills to prohibit juvenile drinking and smoking. He also wrote, edited and translated books, invested in railroads and real estate, and championed many humanitarian causes. He remained close to the Billings family for the rest of his life, exchanging letters and gifts and welcoming the family to his country when they traveled around the world.         Tsukioka Yoshitoshi Rising Moon over Mount Nanping, October 1885         Tsukioka Yoshitoshi The Gion District October 1885         Tsukioka YoshitoshiMoonlight Patrol, December 1885         Tsukioka Yoshitoshi Mountain Moon after Rain, December 1885         Tsukioka Yoshitoshi Tsunenobu and the Demon, January 1886         Tsukioka Yoshitoshi An Iron Cauldron and the Moon at Night, February 1886         Tsukioka Yoshitoshi Faith in the Third-Day Moon, February 1886         Tsukioka Yoshitoshi Grave Marker Moon, March 1886         Tsukioka Yoshitoshi The Moon Through a Crumbling Window, June 1886         Tsukioka Yoshitoshi The Moon’s Inner Vision, June 1886         Tsukioka Yoshitoshi Mount Otowa Moon, June 1886         Tsukioka YoshitoshiThe Moon of the Milky Way, September 1886         Tsukioka YoshitoshiTheater District Dawn Moon, 1886         Tsukioka Yoshitoshi Kinto Picks a Plum Branch in the Moonlight, January 1887         Tsukioka YoshitoshiHuai River Moon, June 1887         Tsukioka Yoshitoshi Prostitute Strolling by Moonlight, June 1887         Tsukioka YoshitoshiMaeda Gen’i Viewing the Moon from his Castle, June 1887         Tsukiako YoshitoshiYorisama Watches the Monster Approach the Imperial Palace, March 1888         Tsukioka Yoshitoshi Gojō Bridge Moon, April 1888         Tsukioka Yoshitoshi The Moon of the Moor, May 1888         Tsukioka YoshitoshiMoon of the Southern Sea, 1888         Tsukioka YoshitoshiSeson Temple Moon, 1888         Tsukioka YoshitoshiMount Miyaji Moon, November 1889         Tsukioka YoshitoshiLady Chiyo and the Broken Water Bucket, November 1889         Tsukioka YoshitoshiDawn Moon and Tumbling Snow, 1889         Tsukioka YoshitoshiA Buddhist Monk Receives Seeds on a Moonlit Night, June 1891         Tsukioka YoshitoshiThe Moon’s Four Strings, August 1891         Tsukioka YoshitoshiFarmers Celebrating the Autumn Moon, 1891",
