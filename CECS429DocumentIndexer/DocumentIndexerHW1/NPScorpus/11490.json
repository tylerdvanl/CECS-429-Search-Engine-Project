The camera was programmed to capture images every hour on the hour from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. from September 16, 2008 through January 8, 2009. There may be gaps when there were camera malfunctions, dead batteries, full memory cards, etc. The photos in the subsequent directories may not currently be displayed in sequential order.
