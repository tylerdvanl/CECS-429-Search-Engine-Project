    "body": "Mesa Verde Artist-In-Residence Program       Mesa Verde National Park is proud to announce the 2016 Artist-In-Residence (AIR) program. This program offers professional writers, composers, and visual and performing artists the opportunity to pursue their particular art form while being surrounded by the inspiring ancient architecture of the Ancestral Pueblo people and the sweeping natural landscape of the park. The park provides a historic, rustic residence to selected participants for five, two-week periods:  May 2 through May 15 May 16 through May 29 September 5 through September 18 September 19 through October 2 October 3 through October 16 (preference to local artists)  All participants will be required to attend a short orientation session before being allowed to enter backcountry areas. Also, participants will be required to be a National Park Service \"Volunteer-In-Park\" (VIP) during their residency. No stipend is provided. Participants in the Artist-In-Residence program will find the cabin fully furnished including linens and kitchenware. In return, participating artists are asked to donate to the park a professional digital image of an original piece of work from, and representative of, their residency in Mesa Verde National Park. Should exhibit\/storage space become available, original artwork will be requested. Entries for the 2016 program are accepted from November 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. Notifications of finalists will be made by February 15, 2016. For additional details on program and information on how to apply, download the brochure.
