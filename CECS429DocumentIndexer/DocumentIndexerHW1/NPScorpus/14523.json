    "body": "Donate       There are many ways to donate to your favorite park. Regardless of what form it takes, your donation is greatly appreciated. You can make a gift to directly benefit our park. If you make the gift directly to the park, the entire gift will be used for the purpose you and the park agree upon. No administrative cost is deducted from your gift directly to the National Park Service. Your check will be deposited in a government account and the full amount will be spent as you intended. Most parks have separate donation accounts for park-specific projects and programs for which you can earmark your gift. The New Orleans Jazz NHP offers specific projects such as the Music For All Ages kids program or you can help support live local jazz musicians by contributing to our performance series. Please specify which purpose you intend your gift to go.",
