    "body": "Be A Junior Ranger          Become a Junior Ranger! There are two ways to get a Junior Ranger handbook. When you come to the park, find a Boston National Historical Park Visitors Center. A park ranger, or volunteer, can give you a copy of the Junior Ranger Handbook. If you can't wait to get your hands on one, you can download a copy. To earn the Boston National Historical Park Junior Ranger Badge, you must complete at least five site-specific activities (Old South Meeting House, Faneuil Hall, Paul Revere House, etc.), as well as attend at least one Ranger program.  Enjoy and we hope to see you at the park!",
