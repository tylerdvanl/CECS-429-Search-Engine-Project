(QTVR) movies allow viewers to scan right and left and in most cases all the way around. They provide a way of getting an overall impression of a scene and not just one static view. There are two ways to view each QTVR. The first is by left clicking on the link. Doing that will cause the page to change and the movie to open in the new page. The second way is by right clicking on the link and then selecting \"Save Target As\". This will allow you save each QTVR to your own computer. Once saved you will be able to open each QTVR in a seperate Quicktime window on your computer.   Once open, all you have to do is hold down the mouse on the image and drag to the right or left to pan around. Use the + and - buttons to zoom in and out. The same two options hold true for viewing the JPEG Imgaes. Please be aware that these images are very large files and they may take a while to download depending on your connection speed. You can also see these images in our Photo Gallery. Please note that you will need the latest version of Apple's QuickTime software to view the QTVR Movies below. If you do not have the latest version click here to download it for free.       The Parking Lot & Visitor Center         View Of The Visitor Center From The Parking Lot QTVR Movie (2.49Mb) JPEG Image (4.76Mb)       As you get out of your car you admire the construction of the Visitor Center.  Built in 1935 after the excavation of the ruins at Tuzigoot, it was made to blend in with the reconstructed ruins and used many of the stones from the excavation.            View From Inside The Tuzigoot Visitor Center QTVR Movie (1.55Mb) JPEG Image (3.17Mb)       Going into the Visitor Center you are greeted by some friendly rangers ready to answer questions, and by Western National Parks Association bookstore clerks ready to help you with purchases.  The ranger recommends starting in the museum for an overview of Sinaguan life at Tuzigoot.  Many of the cases contain intriguing artifacts from the pueblo ruins.  Next you’re ready to head up the hill to the Tuzigoot Ruin.         The Tuzigoot Ruin         View From The Tuzigoot Plaza QTVR Movie (2.44Mb) JPEG Image (4.19Mb)       As you start out you climb the hill from the Visitor Center to the first set of rooms.  Although the path is a loop, and separates here, you step into the Plaza to get a full sense of the area between these rooms and the main grouping.  The only ‘flat’ place on the hill, this community area was likely used for daily chores and as a play area for children.           View From The East Side Of The Ruin QTVR Movie (2.12Mb) JPEG Image (3.82Mb)       You continue south along the eastern side of the ruins to the bottom of the loop.  You turn around to face north, starting your view with the Citadel, or tower room.  The only fully reconstructed room in the ruins, it gives you a great idea of what this multi-level pueblo must have looked like.  The walls between you and the Citadel denote more living quarters and storage rooms in this 110-room ruin.  Finally turning to face south again, you see yet another grouping of rooms and a spur trail to the Southern Point.           View From The Southern Point Of The Ruin QTVR Movie (2.26Mb) JPEG Image (3.87Mb)       After walking the spur trail down to the Southern Point, you turn to the north again to start the scene and get another great view of the Citadel showing its imposing location as it rises above the pueblo ruins.  To the west of the ruins is the flat area of the tailings cap where prehistoric farms were likely situated.  Since it is winter no plant life is growing yet.  However, as you turn south and then east you see the lush, green plant life along the perennial Verde River and then the mesquite trees which grow in the flood plain of the river.        Click on the links to learn more about the Tailings Cap and the Verde River.      View From Inside The Citadel QTVR Movie (1.79Mb) JPEG Image (3.47Mb)       Next you walk back up the hill and continue on the loop towards the west.  Some stairs lead you into the first floor of the reconstructed Citadel.  As you look at the wall to the right of the stairs up to the Roof Top, you can see a change in the mortar at about shoulder height.  The mortar on the bottom half is the original mortar, and you can see the more regulated wall construction above from the New Deal crew who excavated and reconstructed in the 1930s.  As you turn around you also see a wall which separated this large room in two.  This wall was installed sometime after the room was originally built, showing that the use of this room changed with Sinaguan needs.  The roofing material is made to replicate Sinaguan building techniques.           View From The Roof Top Of The Ruin QTVR Movie (1.92Mb) JPEG Image (3.37Mb)       Finally you head up another flight of stairs to the Roof Top. Here you can experience how the people who called Tuzigoot home lived their daily lives. Most room entrances were from the top, and from here you can see all the resources available: the land for farming, the river for water, the mesquite and marsh areas for more food and game. Although it's winter, and Tavasci Marsh in the north-east looks dead with only last year’s cattail growth, you can hear the birds who call that oasis home. And finally, to the north, you see the Visitor Center and museum. This is where our tour ends, and you decide to take the west side of the loop back through the Plaza and to the museum to check out more artifacts recovered from the ruins.           Tavasci Marsh         View Of Tavasci Marsh In Winter From The Western Overlook QTVR Movie (2.34Mb) JPEG Image (4.02Mb)       This western platform looks out across the sloping hillside just a little north of the Tuzigoot ruins.  Since it is winter there is a lot of brush on the slope, but no wildflowers have popped up yet.  Looking further you can see last year’s growth of cattails in Tavasci Marsh.  It’s hard to believe that all that light brown area is actually an oasis for birds and other wildlife.  As you scan north you see the marsh disappear around the hill.  To the south you see the trail that brought you to the overlook and, in the distance, the cottonwood and willow trees that line the Verde River.           View Of Tavasci Marsh In Summer From The Eastern Overlook QTVR Movie (3.00Mb) JPEG Image (4.77Mb)       This eastern platform is much closer to the marsh itself so in the clearing of cattails you can see some of the water that makes Tavasci Marsh so lush.  As you look south you see the mesquite brush that surrounds most of the marsh, along with the trail you took to the overlook.  Looking north you see the extent of the marsh and cattails and hear all the birds chattering which call the marsh home.        Click here to learn more about Tavasci Marsh.    The Verde River         The Verde River QTVR Movie (2.78Mb) JPEG Image (4.63Mb)       Starting out you look north and see the Citadel of the Tuzigoot ruins on the hill in the distance.  Turning west, as you look upriver, you see cattails merging into the cottonwood and willow trees that line the banks of the Verde River.  This river was important to the people who lived and farmed at Tuzigoot as a water source.  Today it is important as one of Arizona’s last free flowing rivers and as habitat for almost twenty endangered and threatened species.        Click here to learn more about the Verde River.         Shea Spring         View Of Shea Spring QTVR Movie (3.63Mb) JPEG Image (7.69Mb)       After a long hike through Tavacsi Marsh you end up at Shea Spring.  This is the spring that feeds the marsh, and creates such a special area for Arizona.  First you watch the water tranquilly bubbling up, before turning around to see just how the water affects plant life.  Right around the spring are cattails, but as you turn towards the north, and see the boundary fence line, you see the hillside turn more toward typical desert scrub.  Such an amazing place!         Images and QTVR's by Joshua Boles - NPS Virtual Tour Text by Sharlot Hart - NPS",
