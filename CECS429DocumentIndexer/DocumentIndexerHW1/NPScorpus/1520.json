Map by NPS Submerged Resources Center  The 'Ai'opio Fishtrap is a 1.7-acre pond, consisting of a stone and coral wall forming an artificial enclosure along a naturally curving shoreline. The fishtrap had a variety of uses well into recent history, and it remains as a material signature of native Hawaiians' interactions with the sea. Over time, the wall has slowly collapsed. The NPS Submerged Resources Center comprehensively mapped the seawall as an initial measure in restoring the fishtrap wall.
