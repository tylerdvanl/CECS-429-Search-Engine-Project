Roanhorse 29 October, 2014.   Â    The Northern Colorado Plateau Network (NCPN) covers a geologically and biologically diverse region comprising 16 national parks in four western states, of which Bryce Canyon is part of. These parks contain desert grasslands, shrub lands, forests, caves, large rivers, perennial streams, seeps, springs, and striking geology. Invasive species, trampling and grazing by livestock, and adjacent land-use activities are some of the most significant threats to NCPN parks. The NCPN is designing and implementing a long-term monitoring program to measure key indicators of ecological integrity, or \"vital signs.\" Multiple monitoring efforts will help inform managers of the health of park resources and provide early detection of potential problems. These briefs describe NCPN activities at Bryce Canyon National Park.
