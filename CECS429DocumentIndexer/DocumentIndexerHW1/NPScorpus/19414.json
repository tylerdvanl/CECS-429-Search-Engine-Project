    "title": "Buffalo National River: Concessions",
    "body": "Concessions          These businesses are permitted by the National Park Service to rent canoes and rafts and to provide shuttle services within Buffalo National River. Concessioners provide canoes, paddles, life jackets, mesh litter bags, and shuttles. For an additional fee, some outfitters will shuttle vehicles to a take-out point. We encourage you to contact our concessioners and shop for the services and rates you desire. Concession operations are limited to specific districts of the river. Your choice of canoe and johnboat rentals depends largely upon which section of the river you desire to float or fish. Upper river concessioners can provide services from Boxley to Carver. Middle river concessioners can provide services between Carver and South Maumee. Concessioners of the lower district serve visitors between North Maumee and Buffalo City. If your float extends between two districts, you may select any outfitter within the two districts you will be floating. Any of the outfitters listed may provide services to all sections of the river if a four-day or longer trip in planned. Motors are allowed on vessels upriver to Erbie Boat Launch. Outboard motors are limited to 10 horsepower. Johnboaters must yield to all other watercraft. For more information about concessions contracts, click here.
