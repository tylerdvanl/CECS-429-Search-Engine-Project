This high desert monzogranite climbing mecca is famous for its traditional-style crack, slab, and steep-face climbing. With more than 400 climbing formations and 8,000 climbing routes, Joshua Tree offers challenging climbs for all levels of climbing ability. It is truly a world-class climbing destination. If you are new to rock climbing and bouldering, please be sure that you are properly trained and equipped before you engage in these activities. You may wish to purchase a climbing guide or hiking map if you are unfamiliar with the park. They are available at park visitor centers and at outdoor shops in the surrounding communities. Information about commercial guide services can be found on the Internet and at local climbing stores. Tread Lightly Fifty years ago, the impact of rock climbers at Joshua Tree was minimal, but today the park hosts hundreds of climbers and boulderers on a busy weekend. Learning about and practicing Leave No Trace principles is an important way all visitors can help protect this fragile desert environment, lest it cease to be a viable habitat for plants and animals, a valuable research area for scientists, and a welcoming place for climbers to enjoy.",
