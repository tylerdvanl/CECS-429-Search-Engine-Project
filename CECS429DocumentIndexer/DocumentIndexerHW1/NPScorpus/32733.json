Citizen scientists in national parks get out in the field, gain deeper knowledge about the resources in the parks, and contribute valuable information to assist the parks and monuments they love. Many participants report a greater awareness of contemporary issues, increased appreciation of the value of park resources, and a stronger sense of resource stewardship. For the NPS, citizen science provides a wealth of much needed baseline data about key resources that can be used in planning management actions.       Cascades Butterfly Project Six protected areas in the Cascade Range have established a two-part program to monitor butterflies due to their sensitivity of their life cycles and distribution to temperature changes.
