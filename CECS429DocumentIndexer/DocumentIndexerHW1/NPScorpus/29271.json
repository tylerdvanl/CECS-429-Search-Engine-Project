    "body": "Where to Find Eagles       The Upper Delaware River offers several eagle viewing spots, but be sure you don't disturb the birds if you go looking for them.  These majestic birds can often be seen where creeks and other rivers meet the Delaware. A nearby Pennsylvania eagle viewing location, when the lake is not frozen, is Pennsylvania Game Commission's Shohola Recreation Area, off US Route 6. (Phone: 570-675-1143)   Good viewing with parking areas and public river accesses are at Callicoon and Narrowsburg, New York, and at Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania.  Other open areas may be seen from NY Route 97 (Minisink Ford, Barryville, Pond Eddy). Information boards are located at viewing area pull-offs along NY 97 approximately 1 mile south of the Roebling Bridge (Minisink Ford, NY\/Lackawaxen, PA) and just north of Barryville, NY. To the north toward Hancock, eagles can also be seen at the Equinunk and Buckingham, PA, accesses. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation maintains two well-marked viewing areas in the Mongaup Valley on the Rio and Mongaup Falls reservoirs (off NY Route 42). There is an information\/observation booth at Mongaup Falls. Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area has several active winter eagle use areas: Milford Beach, Dingmans Ferry access, Bushkill boat access, and Smithfield Beach in Pennsylvania; and Kittatinny Point Visitor Center (on Interstate 80) in New Jersey.",
