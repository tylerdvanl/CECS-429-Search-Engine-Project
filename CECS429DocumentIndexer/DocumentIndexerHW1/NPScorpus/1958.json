Reptiles hibernate in the cooler winters, waiting until surface temperatures rise to the 80ºs or 90ºs before becoming active. They can purposefully regulate their body temperatures by basking on trails, resting under bushes, or taking advantage of microclimates. Count yourself lucky if you have the chance to see a rattlesnake, follow a gila monster, or accidentally come upon a desert tortoise.  Reptile species found within Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument include:  Gila Monster Desert Tortoise Chuckwalla Tree Lizard Zebra Lizard Gopher Snake Rattlesnakes",
