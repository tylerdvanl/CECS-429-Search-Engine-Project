    "title": "Dinosaur National Monument: Birds",
    "body": "Birds       With its varied topography, Dinosaur National Monument includes a number of different habitats: riparian (along waterways), sagebrush, pinyon-juniper woodland, grassland, montane forest, and more. These diverse areas are home to more than 200 bird species, some year-round residents, others part-time residents at Dinosaur. Dinosaur's rivers are used by, among others, bald eagles, Canada geese, and great blue herons. High above the rivers, canyon walls are home to turkey vultures, peregrine falcons, and a number of hawk species. Nearly a third of all the bird species in the monument have been detected in the pinyon-juniper woodlands, which cover nearly half the monument.

To ensure a supply of food for winter, these birds stockpile seeds in underground caches. A pouch under the tongue allows them carry more than 100 seeds at a time to the cache site. Listen to a Clark's nutcracker.                Mountain chickadee USFWS  Mountain chickadees (Poecile gambeli) live year-round in Montane forest. These small songbirds eat insects and use tree cavities for nesting. Listen to a mountain chickadee.                   Northern goshawk USFS  Northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) hunt small birds and mammals. These large hawks will aggressively defend their nests from predators (and from humans!). Listen to a northern goshawk.                    Female mountain bluebird (left) and male (right). NPS\/Tiffany Small  Male mountain bluebirds (Sialia currucoides) are a vivid blue, making them easy to identify. Despite their more subdued coloring, patches of blue can also be seen on the females. These birds eat insects and nest in tree cavities. Listen to a mountain bluebird.                 Turkey vulture USFWS  Turkey vultures (Cathartes aura) are often seen soaring in the sky, searching for carrion (dead animals). Although from a distance turkey vultures may appear all black, their featherless red heads are one of their most distinctive features. Turkey vultures use their keen sense of smell to locate food. Because turkey vultures lack a syrinx, the avian vocal organ, their vocalizations are limited to grunting and hissing.               Greater sage grouse USFWS  Greater sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), the largest grouse in North America, require sagebrush and sage steppe for survival. They eat forbs and insects in spring and summer and rely mainly on sagebrush buds in winter. Listen to a greater sage grouse.                 Golden eagle USFWS  Golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) are large raptors that often hunt rabbits, jackrabbits, and prairie dogs. They nest in remote, secluded cliffs. Listen to a golden eagle.                   Common raven USFWS  Common ravens (Corvus corax) are large, black birds frequently seen at both at Dinosaur National Monument and across the West. Ravens, part of the corvid or crow family, are among the most intelligent birds. Listen to a raven.                 Black-billed magpie USFS  With their long tails and distinctive coloring, black-billed magpies (Pica hudsonia) are easy to identify. They make large stick nests in trees. Listen to a black-billed magpie.                  Canada geese with goslings USFWS  Canada geese (Branta canadensis) are common along the river. These large waterbirds nest along the river, sometimes on low ledges above the river. Listen to a Canada goose.                   Common mergansers, female (left) and male (right) USFS  Common mergansers (Mergus merganser), recognizable by their scarlet-orange bills, are often seen along the river. These diving ducks eat mostly fish, but will also feed on small aquatic animals and insects. Listen to a common merganser.                  Burrowing owls USFWS  Burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia) nest underground and feed mostly on insects and small mammals. These small owls can dig their own burrows, but will often use burrows created by prairie dogs or other animals. The males often stand watch on a mound near the nest burrow. Listen to a burrowing owl.                Peregrine falcon USFWS  Peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) are a medium-sized bird of prey, roughly the size of a crow. Although males and females are identical in appearance, the female can be a third larger than the male. These previously-endangered birds nest on high, remote cliff ledges in Dinosaur's canyon country. Listen to a peregrine falcon.                 × Species Attribute Definitions   Definitions Occurrence Occurrence values are defined below. One or more Occurrence Tags may be associated with each Occurrence value. Present: Species occurs in park; current, reliable evidence available. Probably Present: High confidence species occurs in park but current, verified evidence needed. Unconfirmed: Species is attributed to park but evidence is weak or absent. Not In Park: Species is not known to occur in park.  Occurrence Tags Adjacent: Species is known to occur in areas near to or contiguous with park boundaries. False Report: Species was reported to occur within the park, but current evidence indicates the report was based on misidentification, a taxonomic concept no longer accepted, or other similar problem of error or interpretation. Historical: Species' historical occurrence in park is documented. Assigned based on judgment as opposed to determination based on age of the most recent evidence.  Abundance Abundant:   Animals: May be seen daily, in suitable habitat and season, and counted in relatively large numbers. Plants: Large number of individuals; wide ecological amplitude or occurring in habitats covering a large portion of the park.  Common:   Animals: May be seen daily, in suitable habitat and season, but not in large numbers. Plants: Large numbers of individuals predictably occurring in commonly encountered habitats but not those covering a large portion of the park.  Uncommon:   Animals: Likely to be seen monthly in appropriate habitat and season. May be locally common. Plants: Few to moderate numbers of individuals; occurring either sporadically in commonly encountered habitats or in uncommon habitats.  Rare:   Animals: Present, but usually seen only a few times each year. Plants: Few individuals, usually restricted to small areas of rare habitat.  Occasional:   Animals: Occurs in the park at least once every few years, varying in numbers, but not necessarily every year. Plants: Abundance variable from year to year (e.g., desert plants).  Unknown: Abundance unknown  Nativeness Native: Species naturally occurs in park or region. Non-native: Species occurs on park lands as a result of deliberate or accidental human activities. Unknown: Nativeness status is unknown or ambiguous.         × List Differences   The Checklist contains only those species that are designated as \"present\" or \"probably present\" in the park. The Full List includes all the checklist species in addition to species that are unconfirmed, historically detected, or incorrectly reported as being found in the park. The full list also contains species that are \"in review\" because their status in the park hasn't been fully determined. Additional details about the status of each species is included in the full list. The checklist will almost always contain fewer species than the full list.
