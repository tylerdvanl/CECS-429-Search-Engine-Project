Even though we’re close to Los Angeles, many locations within the park are surprisingly wild and remote; the more you know ahead of time, the more you’ll have fun and stay safe. While many of our visitors head straight to their favorite beach or trailhead, you’re always welcome to stop by one of the visitor centers to chat with a friendly park ranger to aid in your trip planning.  This park is also unique in that we jointly manage many locations with partners, like California State Parks and the Mountains, Recreation and Conservation Authority. It takes a village to protect a place like the Santa Monica Mountains, and even though we sometimes have different rules and regulations, we’re all eager to share these special places with the public.",
