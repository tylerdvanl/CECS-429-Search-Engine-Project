At the Island, kids enjoy peeking through Mesa Arch and climbing the back of the whale at Whale Rock. In the Needles, the Cave Spring Trail, featuring a cowboy camp and prehistoric pictographs, is always a hit. Pothole Point is another popular hike, especially if the potholes are full of water and the creatures that live in these small ecosystems. Be attentive when hiking with kids in Canyonlands, as there are unfenced overlooks throughout the park. Discovery Packs \/ Explorer Packs Both the Island in the Sky and Needles districts offer an engaging toolkit for kids eager to explore and learn about the area.
