Listen, you might hear the laughing call of a raven or the mellow whistle of a Say’s phoebe. You might see a Gambel’s quail scurry across a trail or witness a turkey vulture wobble on an air current high above. The pinyon-juniper woodland that dominates most of this area provides an essential habitat for a wide diversity of birds.   At least 54 breeding songbird species and nine breeding species of raptors have been identified in the monument. Several other species are known to pass through during migration and winter months. Recognizing the significance of this area, Colorado National Monument was designated as an important bird area (IBA) by the National Audubon Society and the American Bird Conservatory on May 10, 2000. Birds can be challenging to identify and generate much curiosity. To aid the beginning birdwatcher, the Colorado National Monument Association bookstore offers a broad selection of books and a checklist of common park birds.       Clockwise: turkey vulture, golden eagle, great horned owl; inset: peregrine falcon chicks",
