On your visit you will see caves, cliffs, granite, marble, fossils and these are all part of Oregon Caves unique geology. Geodiversity is the variety of geologic elements, landforms and processes that make up our Earth.             Mixed together, geology and biology have created a wonderful place here, where species from past eras can hide and live on and where newer species pushed out of their habitats by human developments or climate change can find a little home that suits them.",
