    "body": "Fire Management         NPS Photo  Fire is an important part of most ecosystems; however, unmanaged fire can cause catastrophic loss of habitat, homes, and even lives.  In order to preserve the benefits of fire while reducing the drawbacks, the Natchez Trace Parkway has an active fire management program. The Fire Management Division has four primary areas of responsibility: Fuels Management (prescribed burning and mechanical fuel reduction) Fire Ecology (the science of fire) Fire Suppression (extinguishing wildfires) and Fire Education (public outreach) All fire personnel at the Natchez Trace Parkway are also qualified to respond to emergency assignments throughout the nation.
