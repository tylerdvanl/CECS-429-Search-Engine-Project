But every night come out these envoys of beauty, and light the universe with their admonishing smile. - Ralph Waldo Emerson  Join us this summer for our 6th year of celebrating incredible dark skies and inspiring starscapes at Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument. Whether you are an experienced stargazer, an amateur, or you have never looked through a telescope, our incredible volunteer astronomers and park rangers will be on hand to help you get the most out of the night skies.  Can you imagine a world without stars. Perhaps you don't have to imagine; dark night skies are a vanishing resource in many parts of the country. You can learn more about protecting our night skies here.          Our special thanks to the Astronomers of the Verde Valley and to our Astro VIPs for helping to make these events possible every year.",
