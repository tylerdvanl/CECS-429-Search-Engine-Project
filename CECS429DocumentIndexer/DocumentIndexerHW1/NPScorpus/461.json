Follow the links to the left for all the details you may need to plan your visit. To help get you started, here's what a typical visit may include:  Don't miss a tram ride to the top of the Arch for a stunning panoramic view of the St. Louis area.  See a screening of the film \"Monument to the Dream\" which details the construction of the Arch.  Head out onto the Mississippi River on a Riverboat Cruise. Take a helicopter ride and get a birds' eye view of the Arch! Make a stop at one of the park stores for a wide selection of books, videos, posters, and educational materials. Head to the Old Courthouse to buy timed tickets to enter the Arch, to see the restored courtrooms, learn about the Dred Scott case, see a film about Dred and Harriet Scott's fight for freedom, and to visit galleries interpreting the story of westward expansion. (film and galleries open April 2015)",
