His legacy of liberty and equality remains relevant today and has impacted people around the world. Objective(s) Students will research what life was like for the frontier men and women giving significant importance to information pertaining to English settlers and the Lincoln family within and around Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois. Background Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in a one room log cabin made of hewn logs and chinking of clay on his father's Sinking Spring Farm in what was then Hardin County (now LaRue County) on the frontier of Kentucky. A fireplace was built at one end of the cabin and was used for cooking, heating, and illumination of the cabin. A cabin was typically a structure that was sixteen feet by eighteen feet in dimensions where a pioneer family lived, cooked, ate, and slept.  A loft was often added for storage or sleeping space for older children.   Early furnishings for a frontier cabin were sparse and crudely made.  These furnishings included a pole bed, small table with bench style or stools for sitting while eating meals, cooking utensils, butter churn, spinning wheel, water bucket, and small wash tub.  Early mattresses were filled with broomsage, leaves, cornhusks, or feathers.  Cooking utensils were made of wrought iron while bowls, plates, and spoons were made of wood.  Gourds were dried to be used as dippers or storage containers.   Frontier women made their own thread and yarn from flax and produced most of the family's clothing by hand. Animal skins were used to make trousers and moccasin shoes. Shoes were made from tanned hides.  Women also made lye soap from ashes from the fireplace and candles from animal fat.   The diet of frontier settlers centered around what was grown on the farm and in kitchen gardens.  These items usually included corn, beans, squash, pumpkins, cabbage, and onions.  This was supplemented by gathering nuts and berries during the summer months, and hunting wild game during game the winter.  Cornmeal was hand ground or taken to local mills for grinding.  Sugar and coffee were two items that would be purchased for family use.   Farming was the main occupation on the Kentucky frontier and furnished many of the items the family needed.  What the family could not manufacture or produce on the  farm could be obtained by trading with neighbors or local merchants.  Most farms  included a cow or two for milk and butter, hogs for meat, chickens for meat and eggs, possibly a few sheep for wool, and horse or oxen for pulling a plow.  Farming  implements were crude and typically made of wood or metal. Survival of frontier families depended upon bountiful harvest, careful planning,  cooperation, and participation of all family members.             Materials For this lesson you will need the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace and Boyhood Home Rubric sheet, journal entry example sheet, and journal entry worksheet.
