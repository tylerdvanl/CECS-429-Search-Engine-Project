Pearl Lang  Understanding Phenology For thousands of years, people have followed the rhythm of nature's cycles to inform and enrich their lives. Lengthening days, spring flowers, waves of insects, exploding seeds, turning leaves, and migrating birds were all signals to plant, forage, move, harvest, hunt, or celebrate. Today, scientists call the biological events that mark seasonal transitions \"phenological events.\"  Phenology is the study of the causes and consequences of the timing of biological phases.  Â      Volunteers learn how to record observations for an ongoing phenological study. Aya Rothwell  Get Involved At the Boston Harbor Islands volunteers are working with scientists to record observations of native plant and animal species over time. Over many years, these observations will help us understand how climate change affects the islands. As a volunteer, you will register a site, learn about several indicator plants and animals and their phenophases, make observations on multiple visits, and record them on \"Nature's Notebook\" online. If you are interested in volunteering to help with the Phenology study, please register for a program on Stewardship Saturdays.",
