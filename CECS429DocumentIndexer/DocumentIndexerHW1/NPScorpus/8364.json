Plan Ahead and Prepare Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces Dispose of Waste Properly Leave What You Find Minimize Campfire Impacts Respect Wildlife Be Considerate of Other Visitors   To learn more about these principles check out the Leave No Trace website.   Â    Trash Free Park Program The main goal of the Trash Free Park Program is to encourage stewardship and protection of our natural resources. As you prepare for your trip, keep in mind that there are no trash receptacles and anything you carry into the park will need to be carried back out. Cape Lookout National Seashore removed all trash cans from the islands in 1991 and 1992. Since their removal, there has been a tremendous reduction in the amount of refuse and litter on these beaches. The Trash Free Park Program is designed to encourage reuse and recycling practices which reduce our impact on the environment. Purchasing reusable products and containers and avoiding individually wrapped produces reduces the trash to be carried out of the park and the waste in our landfills. After leaving Cape Lookout National Seashore, please recycle glass, plastic, and metal products. As part of our national park system, Cape Lookout National Seashore is a place set aside for its natural beauty and its cultural history. It is one of the few remaining examples of an undeveloped, pristine barrier island ecosystem left on the Atlantic Coast. Please help us to preserve and protect this extraordinary resource.",
