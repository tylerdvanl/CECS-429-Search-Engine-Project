NPS Photo    As a nonprofit education partner of the National Park Service, Western National Parks Association (WNPA) supports 67 parks across the West, developing products, services, and programs that enrich the visitor experience. Since 1938 WNPA has worked to connect new generations to parks in meaningful ways, all with one simple goal: create advocates who want to preserve and protect these special places for everyone, for all time.   At Padre Island National Seashore, WNPA offers support by creating products to reflect the themes and programs of the park to ensure that visitors \"find\" themselves in the natural beauty and serenity of this barrier island park.        At the Malaquite Visitor Center, WNPA operates a store which offers postcards, posters, magnets, bookmarks, sun care products, and personal hygiene items in addition to a wide variety of books. For more information contact the park's WNPA representative at (361) 949-8068 or e-mail at wnpa@pais.org.",
