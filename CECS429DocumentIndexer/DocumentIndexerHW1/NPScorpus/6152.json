    "body": "Curriculum Materials       Augustus Saint-Gaudens (1848-1907) was a leader in American sculpture during the Gilded Age, and helped the nation to memorialize its heroes and move forward after the Civil War. His work was inspired by the classical sculpture of ancient Greece and Rome, but he modeled it with an honesty and realism that reflected his young country's attempt to be a player on the word stage.  Provided below are curriculum items for teachers to use in their classrooms. These lessons can be enhanced by a trip to Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site in Cornish, New Hampshire, the last permanent home of Augustus Saint-Gaudens. The site preserves and celebrates the memory of Saint-Gaudens and the colony of artists that flourished in Cornish in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
