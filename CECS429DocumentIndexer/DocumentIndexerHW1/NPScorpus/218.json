NPS Photo  Picnic Area The Three Maidens picnic area is located along the entrance road to the Visitor Center. The area includes picnic tables, a restroom, and the Three Maidens feature. A valid entrance pass is required to use the Three Maidens picnic area. Bordering Pipestone National Monument to the south is a city park with a large picnic area and overhead shelter. Nature Walk The Circle Trail, which begins and ends at the Visitor Center, is a paved walking trail that leads to several points of interest at Pipestone National Monument.  A valid entrance pass is required to use the trail. We suggest alotting 45 minutes to an hour for the entire walk. Features along the trail include the pipestone quarries, historical markers, Old Stone Face, Winnewissa Falls, Oracle and the native tallgrass prairie.  Trail guides are available for loan or purchase in the Visitor Center. Several benches are placed along the trail. While the trail is not ADA-compliant, it may be wheelchair accessible with some assistance (see Accessibility). Weather in Minnesota is variable. Be prepared for seasonal conditions and rapidly-changing weather. The Circle Trail is open year-round. Seasonal area closures for hazards such as snow and ice may be in effect.",
