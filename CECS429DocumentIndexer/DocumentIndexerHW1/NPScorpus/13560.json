The project will be completed in four segments. Each segment of Beach Drive will be closed in both directions 24\/7 during work. Prior to work beginning on each segment, the National Park Service will post upcoming road work and road closure information on this webpage, so drivers, cyclists and pedestrians can plan their trip through, and around Rock Creek Park. The project includes full depth pavement reconstruction, which requires excavating the entire area and placing a new gravel base before new asphalt paving; improvements to pedestrian and bicycle trails in collaboration with the DDOT; DC Water storm drain rehabilitation and improvement projects; installation and upgrades of raised pavement markers, centerline rumble strips, guardrails and road signs to provide safer road conditions for drivers; parking area reconstruction and rehabilitation; traffic signal and streetlight replacement; and the rehabilitation of six bridges. The four segments of the project are: Segment 1 - Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway NW to Tilden St NW Segment 2 - Tilden St NW to Broad Branch Rd Segment 3 - Broad Branch Rd to Joyce Rd Segment 4 - Joyce Rd to DC\/MD Border Sign up for Project Updates Nixle is a free tool that allows information to be sent through text, email, social media, and the Nixle mobile app. You can register by using either your mobile phone or by going online.
