The National Park Service preserves, unimpaired, the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations. In 1978, the Spanish colonial missions in San Antonio became a part of this family. The San Antonio Missions tell the stories of the people who came into the Spanish missions to live in the 1700s. Acculturating and converting the indigenous population in order to become Spanish citizens reverberates today in the southwest United States. Our history is part of who we were, who we are, and who we will be. The National Park Service invites you to discover American history in all its diversity at San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.
