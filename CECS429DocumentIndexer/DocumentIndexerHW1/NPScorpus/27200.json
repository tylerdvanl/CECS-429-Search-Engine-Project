There were explorers like Hernando de Soto who gave us our first glimpse at this landscape, and Harry Hampton, whose many years of exploring the floodplain and raising awareness to its outstanding opportunities for recreation and the enjoyment of nature helped it to become a national park. There was Francis Marion, who led a group of zealous patriots and used the landscape to hide and ambush the British forces controlling this area. And there was Francis Beidler, who purchased the land for logging, and inadvertently helped to create a national park.",
