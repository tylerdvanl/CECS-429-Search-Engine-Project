Because of the vastness and isolation of these parks, we know that most people will never be able to visit… which is why we have joined together to provide the popular Pacific Islands National Parks blog!         Can't make it to Guam this year? You can still tour the park! View and share our virtual park tour and other videos on our expanding YouTube page.          War in the Pacific NHP offers more information and interaction on its Facebook page.
