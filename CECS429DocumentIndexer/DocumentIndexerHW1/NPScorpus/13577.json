Exploring the Universe: Saturdays and Sundays at 4:00 p.m. Appropriate for ages seven to adult.   During most months, in lieu of one of the above  programs, a special, thematic planetarium program is offered. These programs change each month. Check the monthly schedule for more information. Located within the Nature Center, The Rock Creek Park Planetarium uses high-tech Spitz software to project the image of the night sky onto a large, dome-shaped ceiling. Rangers lead you on a journey of exploration into our solar system, galaxy, and beyond. Free tickets to each planetarium show may be picked up at the Nature Center front desk up to one-half hour before the show. Out of respect for other planetarium guests, it is highly recommended that parents abide by the age recommendations, stated above. For visitor safety there will be no admittance once the planetarium doors close. Outside of the planetarium, evening stargazing sessions occur once a month, April through November. During Exploring the Sky, telescopes are set up at Military Field, off of Military Road, NW. The program is run in conjunction with the National Capital Astronomers Association. Programs are cancelled due to rain and a completely cloudy sky.",
