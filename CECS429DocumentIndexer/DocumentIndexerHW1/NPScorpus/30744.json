Herbster, PEVI Museum Collection  At Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial we strive to be fully accessible. However due to the historic nature and construction of the Memorial not all of our facilities are fully accessible. The Visitor Center is fully accessible in regards to the entrance and restrooms. The park's 15 minute movie about the Battle of Lake Erie and the War of 1812 is also fully accessible with a sound system that can tie into hearing aids along with personal receivers for those with hearing loss. These personal receivers also have the ability to transmit descriptive audio for those with vision loss. The movie is also closed captioned on the screen. The Memorial has limited accessibility. The only restrooms in the Memorial itself are at the base of the Memorial and they are fully accessible. Thus plan ascent to the observation deck with this in mind. The Memorial itself is not fully accessible. Visitors must climb approximately 5 steps to get on Lower Plaza and approximately another dozen steps to get to the Upper Plaza. From the Upper Plaza there are 37 narrow curving stone steps built inside the Memorial to get to the Lower Elevator Landing. In the summer there can be anywhere from a 5 minute wait to 45 minute wait to get to the elevator with a lot this time waiting on these stone steps. There is a landing with a bench halfway to rest. If taking steps or long periods of standing are an issue for you we would encourage you to visit the fully accessible and climate controlled Visitor Center while the rest of your party visits the Memorial.",
