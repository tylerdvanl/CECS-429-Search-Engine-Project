    "title": "Death Valley National Park: Panamint Springs",
    "body": "Panamint Springs Area          • Darwin Falls: A miracle in the desert, this spring-fed waterfall flows year-round in a narrow gorge. Its lush streamside thickets of willows ring with the song of migrating birds in springtime. Located just west of Panamint Springs via a 2.5 mile unpaved road. Although there is no formal trail, the mostly level, one-mile walk to the falls involves rock scrambling and several stream crossings.         • Father Crowley Vista: A landscape of dark lava flows and volcanic cinders abruptly gives way to the gash of Rainbow Canyon below this viewpoint. Walk the dirt track east of the parking lot for a grand overlook of northern Panamint Valley. Vista located west of Panamint Springs on Hwy 190.         • Lee Flat Joshua Trees: The finest stands of tree-sized yuccas in the park grow in this mountain-rimmed valley. Take the paved but rough Saline Valley Road to a junction in Lee Flat. The gravel roads in either direction will provide good views of Joshua trees.         • Wildrose Charcoal Kilns: These ten beehive-shaped structures are among the best preserved in the west. Built in 1876 to provide fuel to process silver\/lead ore, they still smell of smoke today. The last 2 miles of gravel road to the kilns are passable to most vehicles. Located in upper Wildrose Canyon in the Panamint Mountains.         • Aguereberry Point: 1000 feet higher than Dante’s View, this viewpoint gives a perspective over Death Valley from the west. Along the gravel road is the remains of Pete Aguereberry’s camp and his Eureka Mine. The last climb to the point may require a high-clearance vehicle. Located in the Panamint Mountains off Emigrant Canyon Road.",
