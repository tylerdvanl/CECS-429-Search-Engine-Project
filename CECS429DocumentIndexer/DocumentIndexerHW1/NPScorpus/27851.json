An activity booklet complements the overall experience. Upon completion of the program requirements, participating Boy Scouts earn an embroidered patch and certificate.

Â      A volunteer removes lint from formations in Jewel Cave NPS Photo  Black Hills Cave Restoration Camp This annual week-long event is hosted by Wind Cave National Park and Jewel Cave National Monument. The goal of the project is to restore the cave's natural condition along the public tour routes, by removing accumulations of \"lint\" (clothing fibers, hair, skin cells), trail dust, and other unnatural debris.  There is no registration fee, and housing is provided. Two days will be spent working at each cave, with Thursday as a \"day off\" for caving and\/or sightseeing. Prior cave restoration experience is desired, but not required. The Restoration Camp consists of volunteers working on the removal of lint and other materials along the public tour routes.  If you are interested in helping with this rewarding volunteer project, please contact Dan Austin at (605) 673-8318.
