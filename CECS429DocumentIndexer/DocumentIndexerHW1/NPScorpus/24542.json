Public Use and Climbing Route Closures The following areas are closed through July 15, 2016 for the protection of nesting raptors: The Curecanti Needle and adjacent walls within one-half mile, including the area above the listed wall(s) from the canyon edge extending for 50 ft. away from the canyon but not including developed trails and overlooks. Also closed are the climbing routes along the north side of U.S. Hwy. 50 one-half mile east and west of mile marker 149.
