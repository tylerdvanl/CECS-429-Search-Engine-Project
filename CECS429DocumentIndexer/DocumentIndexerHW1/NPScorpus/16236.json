NPS       Approximately 250 species of wild buckwheat are found in the world, with most of the species occurring in arid regions of the western United States. The group has undergone rapid evolution, leading to numerous closely related taxa. The sulfur buckwheats (Eriogonum umbellatum), of which there are 41 recognized varieties in the West, exemplify this rapid speciation. Several varieties of sulfur buckwheat live in the park, but the variety endemic to the park, Yellowstone sulfur buckwheat (Eriogonum umbellatum var. cladophorum), in only found in the Firehole River drainage.
