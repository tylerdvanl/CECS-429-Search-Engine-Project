The heart of the vision is expressed in the six Management Goals that were crafted by the Lower Delaware Wild and Scenic River Task Force prior to national designation. A cooperative approach to management is envisioned with the National Park Service and the existing Lower Delaware Wild & Scenic Management Committee (local and state governments, non-profits) assisting the existing institutions and authorities and local communities with the implementation of the plan and outreach to the public.
