    "body": "National Park Idea        United States national parks represent the  American people's commitment to preserve the best of their natural, historical, and cultural heritage unimpaired for future generations to enjoy.

All American citizens are, in a sense, stewards of sites where history unfolded, where mountains soar, and where rivers run. They keep these parks for the future, and they treasure them today. As former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt said, “There is nothing so American as our national parks. The scenery and wildlife are native. The fundamental idea behind the parks is native.
