The volunteer program strives to involve volunteers in the preservation and enhancement of the park’s resources in an atmosphere of respect and cooperation. Individuals or groups with a range of experiences and backgrounds are encouraged to participate. Volunteering gives you hands-on experience working with the public, park staff, and park resources.
