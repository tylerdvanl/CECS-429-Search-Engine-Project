Overlooks 2 and 3 are handicap and stroller accessible. For your safety, do not climb or go beyond the fences. Swimming and wading are not permitted anywhere within Great Falls Park.          View from Overlook 1 National Park Service  Overlook 1 This overlook is located to the left of the south end of the Visitor Center. It is the closest you can get to the Falls themselves. A short trail leads down to a dirt viewing platform. The rest of the overlook is rocky and will require some easy climbing. Do not go beyond the fences. Falls from this area can cause serious injury or death. Overlook 1 is not handicap accessible.          View from Overlook 2 National Park Service     Overlook 2 This overlook is located further down the trail. Most of the waterfall can be seen from this overlook. Take a left on the small wooden footbridge by the Patowmack Canal wayside. A staircase and ramp leads down to a large wooden viewing platform. This overlook is handicap accessible.          View from Overlook 3 National Park Service     Overlook 3 Follow the trail that goes past Overlook 2 across the second small wooden footbridge. On your left, you will see the High Water Marks pole, with markers showing how high the floods reached. Two viewing platforms provide the best view of Great Falls. This overlook is the last place that the Falls can be viewed. Overlook 3 is handicap accessible.         The overlook that you see across the river in Maryland is located within C&O Canal National Historical Park. No bridges connect Great Falls Park with C&O Canal. If you would like to see the falls from the Maryland side, it will be necessary to drive.
