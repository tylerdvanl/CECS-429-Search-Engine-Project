    "body": "Closed Areas       Your research permit does not authorize you to enter closed or restricted areas in Yellowstone. Examples of restricted areas include most service roads, carcass dump sites, bear management areas, thermal areas, some bird nesting areas, wolf den sites, and trout spawning areas. When you identify your study site in your research proposal, you will be informed about any regularly occurring closures or restrictions in your proposed study site. The Research Permit Office will make an effort to inform researchers about any unanticipated closures in your study area (e.g. fire). All closure signs should be heeded at all times. It may be advantageous to check in with the Research Permit Office on arrival in YNP to get updates.   Bear Management Area closures have been designated to reduce or eliminate human-related impacts in high-density grizzly bear habitat. It is extremely unusual to receive permission to enter a closed Bear Management Area. You may encounter an incident-related closure anywhere at any time. When you check in with the local Ranger, you will receive up to date information about any bear closures in your study area.",
