Visitor Centers       Historic Jamestowne Visitor Center Welcome to Historic Jamestowne! Your visit to Historic Jamestowne can be made more enjoyable and memorable with a little advanced planning and knowledge. This can often make the difference between a good visit and a great visit.                  Welcome to Historic Jamestowne!  Your visit to Historic Jamestowne can be made more enjoyable and memorable with a little advanced planning and knowledge. This can often make the difference between a good visit and a great visit.   During the summer season visitors should dress in light, comfortable clothing, wear comfortable shoes and use sunscreen. We recommended you carry a bottle of water with you. High temperatures and high humidity create higher risk of heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Most of the Historic site is out-of-doors and although not a great distance from an air-conditioned building, staying properly hydrated will help prevent these illnesses. During the fall visitors should have a light jacket available as temperatures can drop suddenly. Winter temperatures can be unpredictable, ranging from mild to extremely cold.

GPS Coordinates : 37°12'40.52\"N  76°46'38.09\"W     Insects The settlers wrote that at Jamestown “the air is alive with a buzz.” The same can be said today. Visitors should be prepared for this onslaught by wearing appropriate clothing and\/or insect repellant. Here are a few insects to be mindful of: • Biting Flies: also called “deerflies,” “horseflies,” or “Mayflies.” These are most active in late Spring and can last throughout the summer. • Chiggers: are small red mites. Chiggers live in grassy areas so be sure you stay on the approved paths\/trails to reduce the chance of being infected. • Mosquitoes: certain mosquitoes can be vectors of disease. Wearing repellant with DEET will reduce the chances of being bitten. • Gnats: these tiny flying insects travel is swarms and can be very annoying. • Ticks: there are several varieties of tick at Historic Jamestowne. Wearing insect repellant, tucking pants into socks, and inspecting for ticks after a visit is recommended. Pets Pets are welcome on the Historic Site but not in the Visitor Center and they must be maintained on a leash.          Other Things We Would Like You to Know: • No rollerblades, roller-skates, scooters, or skateboards are allowed in the park. • Do not feed any wildlife that you encounter, this includes the birds, squirrels, rabbits, raccoons or foxes. Feeding wildlife will eventually remove any fear of man they have and could lead to aggressive behavior endangering other visitors. It is a violation of federal law to feed wildlife in a National Park. • Do not allow children to walk or run on the brick foundations or earthen mounds on the historic site. This could lead to injuries and the wearing down of these structures. • Picnicking is not allowed anywhere on the Historic Site. However, we do have picnic tables located in the parking area. Most of these areas are “Leave no Trace” and require you to take your trash with you. This will help us keep the park clean and the animals in the wild, instead of around visitor areas.
