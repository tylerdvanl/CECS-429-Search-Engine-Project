Upon Arrival: As you arrive at Muir Woods, proceed to the main parking lot follow the signs to the accessible parking stalls located closest to the Visitor Center and park entrance. Accessible restrooms are located across from the parking stalls. The surface material within the entry plaza is a compacted mix of recycled asphalt and dirt. The surface is firm and stable. There are several accessible benches located in the entry plaza.     Inside the Park: Once you arrive, head towards the Visitor's Center. Here is where you can request assistive listening devices for our Ranger Led Tours and Mp3 players containing an audio described recording of the Muir Woods Brochure. The Visitors Center also provides a copy of the Muir Woods Brochure in Braille along with a Braille Trail Map. After stopping at the Visitors Center, follow the raised accessible boardwalk. This boardwalk is part of the Muir Woods Main Loop trail. If you follow the raised boardwalk to the right it will lead to an accessible gift shop, café and restroom facility. Signage is provided. If you choose to continue into the Redwood Forest, the accessible boardwalk will continue for several hundred feet to the Pinchot Tree Area. There are several informational waysides along the boardwalk. If you proceed past the boardwalk you will encounter an asphalt trail which is usable; however, it contains potholes and severe cracks due to heaving tree roots. As funding and resources allow, we will continue to replace the existing asphalt with an accessible raised boardwalk.   Departure: As you exit the forest, please return any assistive listening devices and Mp3 players to the Visitors Center. We hope that you have enjoyed your experience at Muir Woods National Monument.
