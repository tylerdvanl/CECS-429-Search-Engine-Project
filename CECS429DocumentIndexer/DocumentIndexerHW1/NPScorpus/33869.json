The Parks' Environmental Management Team, established in 2005, consists of members from all divisions of the park staff and works to foster a \"green\" ethic in all aspects of park management. The team develops and implements best management practices emphasizing safety, efficiency, and resource stewardship. Enabling employees to operate our facilities with sustainable practices helps reduce overhead costs spent on utilities as well as costs spent on facility maintenance. With sites spread across four municipalities, we have the potential to create a region-wide impact. The park is committed to ensuring that energy efficiency and environmentally friendly, sustainable practices are a part of our regular operations.             Want to learn more about the goals that we are working towards?
