NPS Photo  The diverse habitats found in Great Basin National Park give rise to hundreds of species of wildflowers. Many flowers are attention-grabbing and dazzling with large blossoms and stunning colors. Others require a more observant, but well rewarded, eye.  Generally, wildflowers are most abundant at lower elevations early in the season, and at higher elevations later. Wet years typically provide a greater abundance than dry years.  But regardless of precipitation or month, whether from the car or by foot out on a trail, visitors of all ages and abilities can find wildflowers to enjoy.
