Named for Lt. Frederick Schwatcka, the fort is one of four coastal defense posts built in 1942 and 1943 to protect the Dutch Harbor Naval Operating Base. Lt. Schwatcka conducted several military surveys in Alaska in the 1880s, including in Unalaska.  Visitors to the area may explore the remaining structures and ruins of Fort Schwatka, and sense the scope of the war effort mounted in the Aleutians to protect the United States from the Japanese invasion. There are also opportunities for self-led driving tours on Amaknak and Unalaska Islands.  Built to Last  The army built over a hundred buildings at Fort Schwatka. At 897 feet above sea level, the installations on Mount Ballyhoo were the highest coastal defenses in the United States. Engineers designed the concrete observation posts and command stations to withstand earthquakes and 100 mile-per-hour winds.   The fort overlooks Dutch Harbor and was key to its protection. Although many of the bunkers and wooden structures of Fort Schwatka have collapsed, the gun mounts and lookouts are among the most intact of their era in the country.",
