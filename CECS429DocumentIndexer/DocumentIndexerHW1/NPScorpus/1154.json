Mau Loa O Mauna Ulu is the start of the Keauhou Trail to the coastal sites. On the \"mauka\" (uphill) side of the road, a view of Mauna Ulu and on the \"makai\" (ocean) side, an awesome view of the Pacific Ocean. Here you will see the \"shiny\" glaze of Mauna Uluʻs pahoehoe lava flow. This reflection off of the lava is created from the outer layer of silica, surface glass. Vegetation in this area is sparse due to the lack of rain and the porous pāhoehoe lava.             Distance From the Beginning of Chain of Craters Road Distance From Kīlauea Visitor Center    Stop #1Lua Manu Crater 0.5 mi \/ 0.8 km 3.8 mi \/ 6.1 km    Stop #2Hilina Pali Road 2.3 mi \/ 3.7 km 5.6 mi \/ 9.0 km    Stop #3Pauahi Crater 3.3 mi \/ 5.3 km 6.6 mi \/ 10.6 km    Stop #4Mauna Ulu 3.7 mi \/ 6.0 km 7.0 mi \/ 11.3 km    Stop #5Mauna Ulu Flow Across Chain of Craters Road 4.1 mi \/ 6.6 km 7.4 mi \/ 11.9 km    Stop #6Mau Loa o Mauna Ulu 6.4 mi \/ 10.3 km 9.7 mi \/ 15.6 km    Stop #7Kealakomo Overlook 9.9 mi \/ 15.9 km 13.2 mi \/ 21.2 km    Stop #8Pu‘u Loa Petroglyphs  16.3 mi \/ 26.2 km 19.6 mi \/ 31.5 km    Stop #9Hōlei Sea Arch  18.8 mi \/ 30.3 km 22.1 mi \/ 35.6 km    Stop #10End of Chain of Craters Road  18.8 mi \/ 30.3 km 22.1 mi \/ 35.6 km          Return to: Drive Chain of Craters Road - main page Things to Do",
