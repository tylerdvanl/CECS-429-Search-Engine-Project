NPS Photo      Military History – Lonely SentinelsThe Point Loma peninsula forms a natural protective barrier at the entrance to San Diego Bay, rising 422 feet to provide strategic views of the harbor and ocean.  In 1852, the government of the United States recognized the importance of this sandstone rampart and designated the area as a military reserve.  In 1899, the War Department dedicated Fort Rosecrans and built a series of gun batteries over the years.  During World War I and II, military facilities on the Point provided vital coastal and harbor defense systems.  Between 1918 and 1943, the Army constructed searchlight bunkers, fire control stations, and gun batteries.  The largest guns were at Battery Ashburn, adjacent to the park entrance station, where two 16-inch guns could fire 2,300 pound shells nearly 30 miles out to sea.        Massive 16-inch gun formerly at Battery Ashburn.  After the war, it was dismantled and sold for scrap.

While visiting the park, you will find base-end stations, fire control stations, searchlight bunkers, a radio station which now houses an exhibit, and other remains of troubled times; lonely sentinels that now serve to guard our memories of the past.       Relic coastal defense systems dot the Point Loma peninsula, including Cabrillo National Monument.
