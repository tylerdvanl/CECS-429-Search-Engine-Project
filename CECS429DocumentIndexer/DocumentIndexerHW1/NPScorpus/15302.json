Unlike other sites that have a contiguous block of land, this park stretches across much of the traditional Nez Perce homeland. Of the park's thirty-eight sites, the National Park Service owns nine and each one offers its own set of challenges and opportunities. Managers make informed decisions based on National Park Service policies and park planning documents. The park's primary planning tools, the General Management Plan and Comprehensive Interpretive Plan are included as part of this website.",
