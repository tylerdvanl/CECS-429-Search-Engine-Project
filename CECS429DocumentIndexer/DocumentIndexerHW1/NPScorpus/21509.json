With passage of the National Historic Preservation Act in 1966, Congress declared that the spirit and direction of the nation are founded upon and reflected in its historic heritage; and that the historical and cultural foundations of the Nation should be preserved as a living part of our community life and development in order to give a sense of orientation to the American people. The NHPA Section 106 review process ensures historic properties are considered during the development of any federal project.
