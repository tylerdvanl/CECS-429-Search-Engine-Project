According to a recent study, twenty-five distinct vegetative communities were identified within the park boundary, as well as over 700 species of trees, shrubs, grasses, and other plants. The humid sub-tropical climate supports this diverse community of plants, as well as the parkâ€™s network of streams, ponds, and springs.",
