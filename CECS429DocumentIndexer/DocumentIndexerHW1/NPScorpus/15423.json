This page is dedicated to showcasing the work of young people who visit the park. If you or your class recently visited the national lakeshore, and you have produced something interesting to share, please call Edwin Alcox at 219 395-1548. We can't promise it will make the gallery, but we will review the work and let you know if it can be used. Check out the letters and drawings from Liberty Elementary School. Mrs. Janes brought her class on a field trip to Chellberg Farm and participated in the Autumn Harvest program with Park Ranger Christy Gerlach in October. The students then wrote letters and drew pictures about their experience and shared them with the park. See More.....  Â     (object placeholder)",
