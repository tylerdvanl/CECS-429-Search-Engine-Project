It was a gift from the people of Belgium in gratitude for Hoover's famine relief efforts on their behalf during the First World War.        Workers installing the Statue of Isis in West Branch, 1939 Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum       Expressions Of Gratitude  After the war, Herbert Hoover was sent many gifts expressing the gratitude of the Belgian people for his humanitarian efforts. Some sent him beautifully embroidered flour sacks, like those on display at the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum. Many Belgian children, refugees, and soldiers contributed to a fund to create this work of art.  Placement At The Historic Site  When the Belgians shipped the finished statue to California's Stanford University in 1922. It remained on campus until the President and Mrs. Hoover brought it to West Branch in 1939. They wanted it to be placed in a position where it was contemplating the house, which is why Isis sits in her throne-like chair facing the Birthplace Cottage.  The Mysterious Goddess  Isis wears a veil, a symbol of the mysteries of life. Her right hand carries the torch of life-its three flames represent the past, present, and future. Her left hand holds the key of life. An ancient Egyptian goddess and an American President are an unlikely pairing. But it provides a powerful visual link between Hoover's childhood and his life's dedication to the welfare of others.             Isis, Goddess of Life     Considering Herbert Hoover’s Quaker upbringing, you might be wondering why there is a statue of the Egyptian goddess of Life sitting on the grounds of his birthplace.

As President he increased the budget for children's programs. After his presidency, Hoover was chairman of the Boys' Clubs of America for 25 years. He raised money and helped open 500 new chapters. Hoover's global relief work also inspired the creation of UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, a leading advocate for children's welfare and rights around the world.             Helping Children in Need     The loss of both parents before his tenth birthday made Herbert Hoover deeply sympathetic to children in need.
