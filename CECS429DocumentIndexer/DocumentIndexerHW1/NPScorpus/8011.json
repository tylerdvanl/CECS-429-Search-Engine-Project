There is no fee to travel the Blue Ridge Parkway and entrances and exits are available at intersections with all major highways. Taking short side trips into the many communities along the Parkway route is an excellent way to explore this region of the country. There is a charge for camping ($16 per site) and those visitors with the Interagency Senior or Access Pass (formerly named Golden Age or Golden Access Passports) pay a reduced camping fee. More information about the passes is available on the USGS website, including where you can apply for passes. Passes are available at all Blue Ridge Parkway Campgrounds.  Some Parkway campgrounds are on the reservation system and reservations can be made at recreation.gov. Please visit our camping page to learn more.  Some activities on the Parkway require a permit, such as weddings, commercial tour groups or filming, agricultural leases, scientific research, and right of way access. Please go to our permits page to apply.",
