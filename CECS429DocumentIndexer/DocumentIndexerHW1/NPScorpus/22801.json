The land was used either for cattle grazing or for irrigated crops or has been impacted by fire or exotic weed infestations. Four hundred (400) acres of the park on the south side of the Arkansas River were grazed even after the land was purchased by the government in 1979. Prior to 1979, the area supported a farmstead and a herd of cattle. The land on the north side of the Arkansas river was primarily used for raising crops. Currently, sixty-eight acres on the north side of the river are being restored to native grasses.",
