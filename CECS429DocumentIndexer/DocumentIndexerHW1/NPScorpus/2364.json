They are stocky with a broad head, small beady eyes, and a rounded snout.Both species have varying combinations of light and dark dorsal spots, giving them the name tiger salamander. Larvae will have three gills on each side of their head. Early in development they lack legs.  Habitat   Underground burrows in the coniferous forests on the rims of the Grand Canyon. Usually lives near the still or sluggish water of ponds, rain pools, and cattle tanks.   Behavior   Most commonly seen during breeding season in mid-winter to late spring, when they reproduce in pools and ponds. Tiger salamanders are considered “mole salamanders,” because they spend the majority of the time in their burrows. Eat a wide variety of surface and subterranean invertebrates. Adults will also eat larger prey, including tadpoles, lizards, small snakes, and mice.       More Information  National Geographic BioKIDS",
