From 1990 through 1996, the National Park Service restored Slaven's Roadhouse to its original 1938-42 condition.  Slaven's Roadhouse continues to serve the public as a landmark along the Yukon River. It is open to public access and frequently has people spending the night while traveling up and down the river.  Each February, it serves as a dog drop point during the Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race. At times, the roadhouse also serves as quarters for volunteers working for the National Park Service.       A Yukon Quest musher tends to her dogs as the aurora dances above Slaven's Roadhouse and a warm welcome awaits inside.
