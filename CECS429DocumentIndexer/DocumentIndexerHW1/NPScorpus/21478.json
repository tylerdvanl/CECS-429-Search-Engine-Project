    "body": "Picnicking         Individual family picnic sites are first-come, first-served; these fill up quickly on summmer weekends, and weekdays when Medano Creek is flowing well. NPS Photo by Patrick Myers  The picnic area at Great Sand Dunes NPP stretches along the edge of the dunes and seasonal Medano Creek. Most sites have some shade from cottonwood and\/or conifer trees. Each site has a picnic table and charcoal grill. In summer months, a restroom is available in the middle of the picnic area. A larger restroom is open year round near the picnic area at the Dunes Parking Lot. Picnic sites are day-use only; visit our camping page for overnight camping stays, or lodging page for nearby motel and other accomodations.
