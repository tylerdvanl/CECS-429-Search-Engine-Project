    "body": "Fact Sheet: Gateway National Recreation Area       Gateway to Opportunity Established: October 27, 1972 Location: New York and New Jersey Overview: When Gateway National Recreation Area was added to the National Park System in 1972, it was heralded as a breakthrough in recreation planning. Located in the heart of urban America, Gateway National Recreation Area brought National Park Service programs closer to the people than ever before. Gateway National Recreation Area’s three park units all trace the rich history of the nation and harbor. Historic forts, former airports, recreation areas and America’s oldest operating lighthouse tell fascinating stories of defense, aviation firsts, navigational safety and healthy living. It is truly a “gateway” to the National Park experience. Recreational and educational programs are available at Gateway throughout the year. Activities include ocean swimming, nature walks, sailing, bicycling, bird watching, camping, astronomy and fishing. The park also hosts a wide range of concerts, sporting tournaments and other special events. Lectures on the history and natural resources are also provided for visitors. Today, Gateway NRA encompasses more than 26,000 acres in New York and New Jersey and attracts almost 10 million visitors a year.
