It is however a journey to distinctive isolation, majestic beauty, and unparalleled access to wildlife. It is a unique opportunity to escape civilization and claim river views that not many have seen in comparison to the nearby Greenbrier, New, and Gauley Rivers. The most difficult task associated with canoeing the Bluestone, is to find the right time to go. The Bluestone's water levels are frequently too low for sufficient paddling, especially during the height of the summer season. The river depth should measure between four and seven feet on the Pipestem gauge for boats to navigate the river safely and without getting hung up on rocks. River levels can be obtained by calling 304-466-0156. River trips may also be subject to availability of the tram provided by Pipestem Resort State Park.
