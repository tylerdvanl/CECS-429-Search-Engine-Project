Park managers realize the park is at risk from the effects of climate change and developed several commitments to reduce greenhouse gases. The plan for new management of transportation and facility operations is available here.  Climate change poses challenges for the National Park Service to leave park resources unimpaired for future generations. The Service created a Climate Change Response Strategy that designed goals and objectives to address climate change. It utilizes four components: science, mitigation, adaptation, and communication to guide activities and is available here.          NEXT PAGE >> Monitor the Environment      How Else Is South Florida Affected? << PREVIOUS PAGE",
