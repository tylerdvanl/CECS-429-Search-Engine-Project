It can be seen in the predominance of French names; in the architecture of houses, churches, potato houses, and twin barns; in the cultivation of potatoes and buckwheat; and in local arts. It can be tasted in traditional foods and heard in casual conversations and stage performances.The Acadian Archives at the University of Maine at Fort Kent can help you learn more about this culture. These regional historical and cultural archives were established in 1989 by an act of the Maine State Legislature. Their mission is to document, preserve, celebrate, and share information about the history and cultural heritage of the St. John Valley.
