The National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, other federal, state, and county agencies, and private landowners work in partnership to manage the Niobrara National Scenic River. The Niobrara National Scenic River Visitor Center is located at 214 West Highway 20 in Valentine, Nebraska. From Memorial Day through Labor Day, this office is open from 8:30 a.m. through 4:30 p.m., seven days a week. The rest of the year, it is open 8:30 a.m. through 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, and closed on holidays. You will find the official Niobrara NSR National Park Passport Stamp and a small store with items such as t-shirts, patches, and books available here. 80% of Niobrara NSR visitors come on Saturdays, resulting in a more social experience. 10% visit on Sundays, and the remaining 10% visit during the rest of the week. If you are seeking a more solitary experience, consider visiting Monday through Friday. The Niobrara River is predominantly (>70%) ground-water fed, so river levels do not necessarily vary as a direct result of rainfall. Water levels fall as upstream demand for irrigation increases during the growing season. You may find information on current river conditions here.
