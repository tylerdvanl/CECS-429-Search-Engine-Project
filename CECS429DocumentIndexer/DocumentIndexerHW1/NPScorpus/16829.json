    "body": "Guest Speakers          Â    Although nothing compares to an in-person visit to Death Valley National Park, a field trip may not be practical or possible for your school or organization. If you are located within 200 driving miles of park headquarters, Death Valley can come to you, when you arrange for a ranger to visit your group as a guest speaker. Rangers are available to speak to classrooms on a variety of topics, from geology to biology to history to conservation issues. We will develop hands-on activities tailored to your curricular needs for grades Kindergarten through 12. If your school is hosting a Science Night or Earth Day celebration, Death Valley can bring a booth to the event. We also offer programs on ranger career paths and federal resume writing workshops. We are happy to address college classrooms, senior organizations, or community youth groups like 4H, Scouts, or Boys & Girls Clubs as well. To apply for a ranger visit to your venue, complete an Outreach Request form. Note that scheduling of guest speaker programs depends on staff availability. Due to limited resources, we try to maximize our impact during outreach events. If you are located within 100 miles of the park, we would like to address at least 20 people. If you are between 100 and 200 miles of the park, we would like to address at least 50 people. Contact the park Education Specialist to discuss exceptions. The ideal group size for each program varies depending on activities scheduled, but generally speaking, no more than 60 people should attend a single session. We are happy to offer multiple sessions to accommodate all of your students. Guest Speaker programs are free of charge. Contact : Education Specialist",
