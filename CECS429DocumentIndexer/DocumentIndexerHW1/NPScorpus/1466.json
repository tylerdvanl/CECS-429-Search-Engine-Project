Alluvial Fan and Old Fall River Road This area, along with Old Fall River Road, suffered extensive damages during the flood. Currently, there is no trail access in the Alluvial Fan area from either the east or west parking areas as those trails were destroyed. If walking or hiking off road or trail in flood-damaged areas use caution and check area signs or ask a ranger for information and safety tips. Endovalley Road is open to vehicles. Old Fall River Road reopened to vehicles on July 2, 2015 and closed for the season on October 23. Normally the road is open from the fourth of July to early October.
