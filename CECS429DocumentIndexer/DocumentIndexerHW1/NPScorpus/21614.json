Dena'ina Athabascans, Yup'ik, Russian explorers, gold prospectors and trappers, and American pioneers are the forebears of today's residents.      The Dena'ina Athabascan People  Alaska Natives settled in this region some time after the close of the Last Great Ice Age -- 14,000 years ago. Dena'ina, Alutiiq, Yup'ik and other groups have interacted with one another over the centuries, through warfare as well as trading and peaceable exchanges. Today, six Resident Zone Communities are identified for Lake Clark National Park and Preserve.
