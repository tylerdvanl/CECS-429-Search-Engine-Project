Which ocean depends on which side of the continental divide it is on. A continental divide marks a line on a continent where rivers on either side of it flow into different oceans. The continental divide in the preserve separates the rivers flowing into the Arctic Ocean from the rivers flowing into the Pacific Ocean. As each water drop heads to its ocean, it helps to sustain numerous living creatures along the way.  Â       Kugruk Fault Zone Now home to Bering Land Bridge National Preserve, the very old Seward Peninsula started out as an island chain. During the Age of the Dinosaurs, a string of volcanic islands was slowly drifting north on the Pacific Plate. A plate is a large piece of earth's surface that moves. At the same time, a neighboring plate, the North American Plate, was slowly drifting south. Eventually, the two plates collided and the islands were attached to North America. This was the birth of the Seward Peninsula. Where it took place can still be seen in the faults, or cracks in sections of rock, of the Kugruk Fault Zone.",
