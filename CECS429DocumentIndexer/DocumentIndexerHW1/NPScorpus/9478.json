Over 350 volunteers celebrated Earth Day and the National Park Centennial with a day of stewardship at Greenbelt Park, Maryland. Volunteers cleaned the Still Creek watershed, repaired bridges along the nine miles of trails, painted eight comfort stations, cleaned the campsites in the 174 site campground, and spread mulch in the playground and picnics areas.                                        SCA’s mission is to build the next generation of conservation leaders and inspire lifelong stewardship of the environment and communities by engaging young people in hands-on service to the land. It’s Our Job, Every Day It happens every day, all over our great country. A 19-year-old in Louisville. A 20-year-old in Des Moines. A 16-year-old in Nome. Every day our youth want to do something important with their lives, and begin to ask, “Who am I?” and “Who do I want to become?” At the same time, every day our parks and natural resources fall into disrepair and are depleted. Today we stand at a critical point in time where the desire to do something can be met with the need to preserve and protect our environment. SCA is there. Every day SCA unites young people with hands-on environmental challenges. Every day we create future stewards of our land, healthier environments and—ultimately—a better world.
