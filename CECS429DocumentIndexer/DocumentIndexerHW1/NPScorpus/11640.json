For wildflower enthusiasts, a trip to Point Reyes in the spring and summer is a must. Wildflowers bloom at the Seashore from February through August, depending on many factors including the amount and frequency of rains. Colors range throughout the spectrum and across many sizes. They can be viewed in many habitats including woodlands, scrublands, grasslands, coastal bluffs, beach, dunes, disturbed areas, and salt marsh edges. Abbotts Lagoon, Chimney Rock, and Tomales Point are just a few of the locations where the flowers bloom early in the season. Remember that wildflowers are protected by law in national parks. Please don't pick the wildflowers or crush them by straying off the trails.
