    "body": "Women's Rights Movement       The 1848 Seneca Falls Woman's Rights Convention marked the beginning of the women's rights movement in the United States.  The Convention recruited supporters and included many action steps to advance the movement:  In entering upon the great work before us, we anticipate no small amount of misconception, misrepresentation, and ridicule; but we shall use every instrumentality within our power to effect our object. We shall employ agents, circulate tracts, petition the State and national Legislatures, and endeavor to enlist the pulpit and press in our behalf. We hope this Convention will be followed by a series of Conventions, embracing every part of the country.  One hundred participants of the Convention signed this pledge. Two weeks later a Woman's Rights Convention was held in Rochester, New York on August 2. It was followed by state and local conventions in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. The first National Woman's Rights Convention was held in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1850. The women's right movement grew into a cohesive network of individuals who were committed to changing society. After the Civil War national woman's suffrage organizations were formed.",
