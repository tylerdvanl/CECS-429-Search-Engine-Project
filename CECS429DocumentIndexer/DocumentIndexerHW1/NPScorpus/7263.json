It is estimated that there is one snake per acre on average, and there are over 120,000 acres in Bighorn Canyon NRA. This species usually grows to be around three feet long, and they like to hunt at night during the summer months when it is cooler. While hiking in the park, watch your step. Always step up on a rock or log before stepping completely over. Don't place your hand in a place where you cannot see. Wear loose clothing. Jim Staebler",
