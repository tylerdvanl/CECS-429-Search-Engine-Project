No Name Trail Map, 18 KB pdf file Distance: 1.3 mile (2.1 km) Duration: allow 45 minutes to 1 hour Elevation Gain: 250 feet  Trailhead: archway behind the Visitor Center Walk underneath the covered bridge on the No Name trail which follows Cave Creek, crosses the creek, and then does a steep climb back up to the other end of the Monument. You can relax on the many benches along the trail and listen to the sounds of the forest. The hike is short, but steep. The scenery is beautiful, and there are two short trails which lead to two waterfalls on No Name creek. This is a good route to take back to the parking lot after a cave tour.
