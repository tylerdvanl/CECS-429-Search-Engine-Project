Compare the Arch to other monuments:     Gateway Arch -- Jefferson National Expansion Memorial 630 Feet   Southwestern Bell Telephone Building (St. Louis, Missouri) 587 Feet   Eiffel Tower 984.25 Feet   Interior Dome Height of the Old Courthouse from the Floor of the Rotunda to the top of the Lantern 161 Feet   Statue of Liberty 305 Feet   Washington Monument 555 Feet   San Jacinto Monument (San Jacinto, Texas) 570 Feet   Empire State Building 1,250 Feet      The Gateway Arch is one of the newest monuments in the National Park system, and at 630 feet, it is certainly the tallest! The Arch is 75 feet taller than the Washington Monument and over twice as tall as the Statue of Liberty. The 60-foot heads carved on the face of Mount Rushmore are designed to the scale of men who would stand 465 feet tall, a height that would easily allow such giants to walk through the legs of the Arch! While the Gateway Arch is America's tallest monument, several buildings, such as New York's Empire State Building (1250 feet) and Chicago's Sears Tower (1454 feet) would loom over the Arch.",
