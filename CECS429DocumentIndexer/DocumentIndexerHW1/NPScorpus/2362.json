These cats are common, but rarely seen, members of Grand Canyon's nocturnal community. They spend most of their days denning in rock crevices or in the hollows of trees and generally hunt by night. While they principally feed on small mammals (like squirrels and rabbits) and birds, they are capable of bringing down animals as large as deer.      Identification:  To avoid confusing these felids with feral or other cats, look for these characteristics:   Bobcats generally weigh up to 30 lbs (13.5 kg).  Adults have a body length of 30-35 inches (75-90 cm).  Generally a tan color along the back and outside of the legs with white on their underside;black blotches are generally found on the legs, tail, and face.  This is the only native cat in Arizona with a short tail.        Quick Facts about Bobcats:   Females are generally ready to breed at about one year of age, while it usually takes males two years. Females will produce a litter of 2-4 kittens each year, usually in the spring. While other carnivorous Grand Canyon residents like the coyote may be seen eating plant parts (like prickly pear cactus fruit), bobcats are almost entirely meat-eaters.",
