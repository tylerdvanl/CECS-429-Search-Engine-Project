Visitors may possess firearms within a national park unit provided they comply with federal, state, and local laws.  The role of the responsible gun owner is to know and obey the federal, state, and local laws appropriate to the park they are visiting. For more information about Pennsylvania gun laws, please visit their website.  Please remember that federal law prohibits firearms in certain park facilities and buildings. These places are marked with signs at public entrances.      Refund Policy In the event you miss your Short Train Ride (yard shuttle), we can put you on the next shuttle as long as the train is not sold out or was the last train of the day.
