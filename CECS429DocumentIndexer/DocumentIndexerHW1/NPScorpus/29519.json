    "body": "The Childhood of a Renowned President  Only one U.S. president was born in New York City. Raised in a townhouse at 28 E. 20th St., Theodore Roosevelt would grow up to be our 26th President and become immortalized on Mount Rushmore. However, he started life as a sickly yet bright boy who exercised to improve his health and began a lifelong passion for the \"strenuous life.\"                Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace is closed.   We are receiving needed renovation work, anticipated to be completed in Early-Autumn 2016. At that time a reopening date will be determined.        Young Artists Rejoice!
