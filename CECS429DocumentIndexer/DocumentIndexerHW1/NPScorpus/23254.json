Help ensure your safety and protect the park's wildlife by obeying all speed limits.   Obey Road Signs  All road signs must be obeyed, such as parking signs and lane markings. Help protect the resource by parking only on hard paved pullouts and not parking on vegetation.    Drugs and Alcohol  Possession of any controlled substance is prohibited.
