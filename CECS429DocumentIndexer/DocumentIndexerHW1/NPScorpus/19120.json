Over the past 15,000 years, lava eruptions created a rugged  landscape that provides habitat for a surprising diversity of plants and animals in a high desert ecosystem. Preservation of the unique geological and biological features found here is the overriding purpose of the Monument. To that end, basic and applied scientific research, resource inventories, and monitoring of resource conditions play important roles in the identification, characterization, and interpretation of the Monument’s resources.      Research Permit  A permit is required for scientific research in the park. Permits can be obtained through the NPS Research Permit and Reporting website.",
