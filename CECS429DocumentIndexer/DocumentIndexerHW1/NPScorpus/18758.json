The Fossil Council founders passed away and the Fossil Council was struggling. In 2003, Hagerman IDEAs Inc., a non-profit organization, recognized that the Fossil Council's mission was important to the community as well as to the Monument and so stepped forward to replace the Fossil Council as the Monument's cooperating, private-sector partner. IDEA continues to partner with the Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument to meet its mission and goals. Charitable donations to this organization are deductible.Here's how you can help:1.
