    "body": "Stone Replacement        Masonry near the ground surface can be severely damaged by the effects of poor drainage and repeated freezing and thawing. When these damaged stones can no longer support the weight of the wall above them, they are replaced with stones of similar size, shape, color, and surface texture. Replacing a few eroded stones at the base of a wall will protect the upper second and third stories of the building.  Â     Wall with eroded mortar and missing stones in need of repair NPS Photo",
