    "body": "Fire Education        Historic fire scars seen at Muir Woods        Fire education is an important fire management strategy which emphasizes fire safety, fire ecology and fuel treatments. At Golden Gate National Recreation Area, fire education focuses on lessons learned from the past fires, community wildlfire protection, and the park's prescribed fire program. Visiting the Park Hiking through Muir Woods, you will see many large fire scars. The last major fire to burn in this area was during the mid 1800's. Ranger led programs often include a disucssion of fire's important role in redwood forest ecology.        Internships in Fire Communications and Education Internships provide another opportunity to learn about fire and fuels management. Past internships have been offered through the Multi-media Studies Program at the College of Marin, the Communications Studies Department at Sonoma State University, and a national partnership with the Student Conservation Association. Fire Education Materials Many resources for teachers are available on the NPS's Fire and Aviation Management Program - Teachers web page.
