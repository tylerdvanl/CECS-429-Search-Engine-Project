The reasons for becoming a Junior Ranger can be as individual as you are. One of the best reasons—IT’S FUN! While doing the activities, we know you will come across something you’ve never done or thought about before. Once you become a Junior Ranger, you are part of a nation-wide team—other Junior Rangers, the National Park Service, and people from all over the world—who work to preserve special places. Glen Canyon and Lake Powell are special places. You and your family may already have many fond memories of trips here; or you may just be starting to collect new memories on your first trip. Start collecting memories as a Junior Ranger. And that’s not only fun, it makes you feel good, too! Follow the link below to view and print your Junior Ranger Activity Book.
