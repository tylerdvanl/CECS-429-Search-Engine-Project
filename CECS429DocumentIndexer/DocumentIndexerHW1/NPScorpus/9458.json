Whether you have half an hour or half a day, visit us and experience the history and beauty of White Haven. Visit the Main House:  Free interpretive visits to the Main House are usually offered every 30 or 60 minutes beginning at 9:30 a.m. Typically the last house visit of the day begins at 4:00 p.m. Call ahead if your schedule is tight. Due to preservation and safety concerns, space is limited for each time slot and tickets (which are free, and available at the Visitor Center desk) are required to reserve a place. Please note that specific time slots may be unavailable due to heavy visitation, group reservations, maintenance activities, or inclement weather. Please call the Visitor Center at (314)842-1867 and talk with the staff at the information desk for the most current information. Watch the 22-minute introductory film, Ulysses S. Grant: A Legacy of Freedom, shown in the Visitor Center theater. Walk the historic trace and learn about the people and property in the 19th century. You can spend minutes or hours in the interpretive museum, located in the historic stable. The exhibits, An Intricate Tapestry: The Lives of Ulysses and Julia Grant place the Grants within the context of 19th century American history, and reflect the important role Ulysses Grant played in the nation's past.
