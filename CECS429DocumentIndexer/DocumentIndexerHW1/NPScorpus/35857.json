(Three arches in China now outrank Landscape in the claim for largest arch in the world.)        Double Arch soars above a tiny figure in blue. NPS photo by Jacob W. Frank  Tallest Opening: The southern span of Double Arch soars 112 feet (34 meters) above ground level. It is also the second-longest arch in the park, at 144 feet (44m) across.        From this angle, Balanced Rock seems to almost defy gravity. NPS photo by Neal Herbert  Biggest Balancer: Standing beneath Balanced Rock, it's hard to grasp its size. The massive sandstone boulder perched atop the pedestal is estimated to weigh 3,577 tons. That's the weight of an icebreaker ship or approximately 27 blue whales.        Delicate Arch from an uncommon angle NPS photo by Neal Herbert  Most Famous: Without a doubt, Delicate Arch is the most famous natural stone arch in the world. Referred to as \"the arch\" by many newly arriving visitors, Delicate has an allure that is hard to explain but impossible to deny.      Every single arch, spire, and other rock shape in the park is a remnant of massive, solid layers of rock that once covered the area. Over time, the layers bulged, cracked, and began to erode away. Given enough time, every arch will be gone and the layer beneath will be exposed... until it, too, is gone. What will the park look like then?",
