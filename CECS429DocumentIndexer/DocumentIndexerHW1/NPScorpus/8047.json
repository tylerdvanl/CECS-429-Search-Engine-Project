While this is true, the glaciers are just part of the story! This area was made a national park because of its unique geology (including the glaciers), importance to American Indians, its diversity of species (like bears), wilderness character and the cultural history of how westward movement changed the people and the landscape. In 1932, Glacier was designated as the world's first International Peace Park which has led other countries around the world to work together to protect shared park resources.          CLICK TO DOWNLOAD THE ENTIRE ACTIVITY BOOK (17.9 MB)   Glacier's Junior Ranger Activity Book  Below are some pages from the book, all in pdf format:   Disappearing Glaciers - connect the dots (957 kb)  Habitats are Homes - matching activity (294 kb) Leave No Trace - short answer questions (1.82 mb) Living Lightly - crossword puzzle (306 kb) Moving Through Glacier's History - fill in the blanks (1.18 mb) See America First - maze (463 kb) Up, Up and Away? - state your opinion (1.5 mb) Native Names - cryptogram (990 kb) Native Names - word search (947 kb) Four Nations - matching game (1.46 mb) Making Peace - short answer (1.25 mb) Wise About Wildlife - fill in the blank (1.24 mb)  Answer Key (2.1 mb)      There are more activities on the Park Fun page.",
