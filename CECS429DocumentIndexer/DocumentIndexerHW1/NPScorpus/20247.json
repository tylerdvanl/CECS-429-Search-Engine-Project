Teachers participating in TRT will have the opportunity to engage in parks and park resources, participate in a webinar about lesson planning, develop at least one lesson to be used in their classroom or school, assist the park with an education project, and increase their understanding of place-based learning. This program will offer teachers a unique opportunity to infuse their teaching skills with NPS-based Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education resources. Administration of the program, professional development hours, and graduate credit hours will be made available to participants through the University of Colorado, Denver (UC Denver) through a cooperative agreement. Program Goals:  Provide teachers with place-based learning experiences  Provide access to the rich resources of the national parks for inclusion into classrooms and schools  Provide teachers with new knowledge and teacher skills related to the resources and themes interpreted in the National Park Service  Provide parks with the expertise of teachers to inform and shape park education programs and services",
