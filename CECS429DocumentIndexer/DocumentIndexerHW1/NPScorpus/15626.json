    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility             Accessibility      Wheelchair AccessMost of the buildings at Fort Larned are now wheelchair accessible thanks to our new kafka paved company streets.  Kafka is decomposed granite mixed with a binder to create a paving material that looks like the dirt covered company streets but which provides a harder and more stable surface for wheelchairs.  The map below shows which buildings and park areas are accessible and how to access them.Please keep in mind that this paving material only makes company streets usable for wheelchairs when it's dry.  After a heavy rain or melted snow, the surface is often too soft for wheelchairs to safely access.        Handicap accessibility at Fort Larned.       Walking DistancesAlthough Fort Larned does have a Visitor Center, most of what there is to see is outside and requires walking. The walk from the parking lot to the Visitor Center is just under one third of a mile.  To walk around the Parade Ground and see all of the buildings is also a walk of just under one third of a mile.",
