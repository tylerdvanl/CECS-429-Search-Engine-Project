Teachers participating in the Teacher Corps Internship program will have the opportunity to engage in parks and park resources, participate in a webinar about lesson planning, develop at least one lesson to be used in their classroom or school, assist the park with an education project, and increase their understanding of place-based learning. Administration of the program, professional development hours and graduate credit hours will be made available to participants through the University of Colorado, Denver,  through a cooperative agreement. Several hours of online training will be required. Projects at Chamizal National Memorial will be tied to the coursework. These projects will be completed independently, possibly from home.  Summer 2016 - Apply by May 18 Chamizal National Memorial is accepting applications for Teacher Corps Interns (TCIs) who will work for 6-8 flexible weeks during June - August, 2016. Interns will assist throughout July with the Trailblazer Find Your Park program which gives local children the opportunity to visit public lands including city, state and national parks of the area. Teacher Corps Interns will also inventory, organize, update and write elementary, middle and high school lesson plans guided by Chamizal National Memorial interpretive themes (the park's mission). As there is opportunity, the TCIs will also participate in a variety of other ranger duties. The stipend is $2400. Housing will not be provided, and interns will work with their own personal computers and emails. Interns will wear shirts and hats with the TCI logo, not an NPS uniform. To apply, submit your resume to Kathy Denton, Education Specialist. It must arrive prior to close of business on Wednesday, May 18, 2016. By mail, send it to the attention of Kathy Denton at the park's address. By email, send your resume to e-mail us. You may also hand deliver your resume, addressed to Kathy Denton, when the administrative office is open. For more information, email Kathy or call her at 915-532-7273 x130.",
