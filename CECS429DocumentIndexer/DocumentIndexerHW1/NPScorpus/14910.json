    "body": "Riverside Camping              You can reach Houchin Ferry Campground by boat or by car. Houchin Ferry Campground has 12 sites, equipped with picnic tables, fire grates, chemical toilets, fresh water and adjacent picnic shelter. Reservations are not accepted for Houchins Ferry Campground, and it does not accommodate large trailers or RVs; these options are available for Mammoth Cave Campground. Camping along the floodplain is by permit only. With a free Backcountry Use Permit, you can camp on riverbanks and islands along the Green and Nolin Rivers. Be sure to camp at least ½ mile away from Green River Ferry, Houchin Ferry and Dennison Ferry Day-Use Area. Pick up your Backcountry Use Permit and a copy of theat the Visitor Center Information Desk. Remember that if putting in upstream at Munfordville, riverside camping may not be permitted on private lands outside the park. Your Backcountry Use Permit is only valid within Mammoth Cave National Park.  For a backcountry map click the following link:  Backcountry Map & Guide When setting up your campsite on islands or on the riverbank, remember that sudden rainstorms can cause rapid flooding. Know the weather forecast so you can anticipate weather-related problems. To hear the National Weather Service forecast in the area, tune your radio to AM 530. A number of regulations apply when you camp in the park. Please obtain the Camping handout from the Visitor Center Information Desk and read it before you camp.  River levels and current fluctuate dramatically, particularly during the winter months, and snags or sandbars may be hidden underwater. Observe weather conditions. Flooding is possible. In case of storms, leave the water and seek shelter.",
