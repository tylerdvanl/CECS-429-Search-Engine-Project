    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Safety            Safety          Park rangers work with our partner agencies Missouri Department of Conservation, Missouri Water Patrol, Missouri State Highway Patrol, and the Sheriff’s departments of our surrounding counties to provide a safe and secure experience for all visitors to the riverways. If you should encounter any problems, record the watercraft number and report it to any ranger, to the above partner agencies, or to any canoe outfitter.  So, please come, bring your families and join us this next season in enjoying the outstanding beauty and natural wonder that makes Ozark National Scenic Riverways one of the most unique and compelling places in our great country.      Rowdy behavior by a small minority of floaters has been a problem in the past. Law enforcement efforts have been increased, new rules are in place and serious efforts are being made to control those who would ruin others' experiences by their behavior. See the Superintendent's message about Rowdiness. If you have not been to the Riverways for some time, this is the time to come back. We have been making a difference on the rivers in controlling unacceptable behavior. In the unlikely event you have any problems, record the boat number and report it to a park ranger, county sheriff or canoe outfitter. The canoe outfitters and park staff are ready to serve you and we encourage you to again bring your families, friends and organized groups. If you wish to enjoy the natural wonders of our beautiful sparkling rivers in a family friendly atmosphere, c'mon down! Canoeing Safety Film from MDC",
