The topics that rangers cover in their classroom presentations depend on the teacher's requests. We recommend that when you make your request, you try to think of subjects that can be easily linked to the monument or local history. Some possible topics include geology, plate tectonics, the rock cycle, Native American cultural history, Modoc culture and war history, Tule Lake Segregation Center, local human history, the food chain, adaptation, ecology, and many more. To request a ranger in the classroom presentation please e-mail or call the education coordinator at 530-667-8119.",
