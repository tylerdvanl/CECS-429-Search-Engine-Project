Bring a camera, easel or journal to record your trip. NPS photo by Neal Herbert   Â   Hiking The trail system at Hovenweep provides visitors excellent views of all the archeological sites. The Square Tower Group features a two mile loop that begins at the visitor center and is a perfect starting point for any visit. Between the visitor center and the first overlook (a distance of roughly 300 yards), the trail is paved and may be traversed by visitors in wheelchairs with assistance. Most visitors spend an hour exploring the area, with the full two-mile loop taking at least 1.5 hours. Visitors may also explore the outlying sites, which include Cajon, Cutthroat Castle,  Holly and Horseshoe\/Hackberry. Most areas have very short (a half mile or less one-way) trails which are primitive and lightly maintained. Backpacking is not permitted at Hovenweep.  Outlier roads may become inaccessible during inclement weather.Trails are open sunrise to sunset. Interpretive Programs Rangers conduct short porch and overlook talks on a regular basis spring through fall. Evening programs are presented May through September in the campground amphitheater.  Subjects vary from season to season. Please contact the park or ask at the visitor center for current schedules. Guided walks and other interpretive programs can be arranged for larger groups. Please contact us in advance.",
