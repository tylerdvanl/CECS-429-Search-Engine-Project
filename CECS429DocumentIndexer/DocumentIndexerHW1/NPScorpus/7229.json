    "body": "Seasonal Poetry       Fog The fog comeson little cat feet.It sits looking over harbor and city on silent haunches and then moves on.  Under the Harvest Moon    Under the harvest moon When the soft sliver Drips shimmering Over the garden nights, Death, the gray mocker, Comes and whispers to you As a beautiful friend Who remembers.Follies Shaken, The blossoms of lilac,     And shattered, The atoms of purple. Green dip the leaves,     Darker the bark, Longer the shadows.   Sheer lines of poplar Shimmer with masses of silver And down in a garden old with years And broken walls of ruin and story, Roses rise with red rain-memories.     May!     In the open world The sun comes and finds your face,     Remembering all. Theme in Yellow I spot the hills With yellow balls in autumn. I light the prairie cornfields Orange and tawny gold clusters On the last of October When dusk is fallen Children join hands And circle round me Singing ghost songs And love to the harvest moon; I am jack-oâ€™-lantern With terrible teeth And the children know I am fooling.",
