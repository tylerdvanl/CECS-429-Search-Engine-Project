Each participates in a web of life and death that keep the surrounding landscape healthy year after year.        Sea otters are among the keystone species in the Sitka National Historical Park NPS photo by Paul Killian  Keystones of the Ecosystem Certain species in an ecosystem drive interactions between ocean, river, and land. Just as an arch would collapse with out the keystone, ecological communities, too, would fail without these all-important animals.  Read more about these important animals.           Geologic forces such as glaciers, volcanoes, and tides are still changing Sitka's shoreline and landscape. NPS photo by Katy Kildee  Geological Formations Glaciation, deglaciation, volcanic activity, and tidal erosion all shaped Sitka's changing shoreline and landforms. Digging into the soil, geologists can tell how the landscape has changed over the millennia. Read more about Sitka's changing landforms          Plants, insects, and animals rely upon a number of variables to live and thrive. NPS photo by Andrea Willingham  Stream Ecology A healthy ecosystem comprises an interconnected web of organisms. Adequate water flow and direct sunlight are only two of the elements necessary to maintain sufficient energy production for life. Read more about this wild, watery ecosystem          Researchers work to assess the status and trends of national lands, waters, plants and wildlife. NPS photo by Katy Kildee  Inventory and Monitoring Program National Park Service researchers coordinate the design, collection, and analysis of critical scientific information in the park to adapt their local and national management of rapid and large-scale environmental change.
