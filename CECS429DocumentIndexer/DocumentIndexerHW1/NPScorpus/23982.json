NPS Photo\/Peter Jones   Your visit to Carlsbad Caverns National Park may include a self-guided walk through the Big Room chamber of the cavern, a hike down the 750-foot trail of the Natural Entrance, a back country trek through the Chihuahuan Desert or birding around a natural spring in the hidden oasis of Rattlesnake Springs. In addition to the self-guided hikes, you may opt to experience the cavern with a park ranger on a tour of the beautifully decorated King's Palace; walk into the deep, dark recesses of Left Hand Tunnel, lit only by a handheld lantern; shimmy through a chimney in Spider Cave; squeeze through a pinch in Hall of the White Giant; climb down a ladder in Lower Cave tour and be amazed at the shimmering Christmas tree formation in Slaughter Canyon Cave. All ranger-led tours are reservable and require an additional fee, see Cave Tours. Join us for a spectacular Bat Flight program, May through October, when hundreds of thousands Brazilian Free-tailed bats exit the cave at dusk on their nightly forage for food. Bat Flight program times change throughout the season, so please check with rangers at the visitor center or call 575-785-3012 for nightly program times. Help us celebrate the National Park Service's 100th birthday all year long! Centennial events are happening throughout the year, like night hikes, climbing demonstrations, bird watching, back country star gazing and much more listed on our Calendar page! You are also invited to watch the park movie entitled \"Hidden Worlds - Carlsbad Caverns National Park.\" The movie features high definition photography of the cave natural wonders, bats in flight, cave tours, and a fly-over of the cave's Natural Entrance. The free, 16-minute long movie shows every 30 minutes daily starting at 8:15 a.m. with the last showing 30 minutes before the visitor center closes.   If you have been in any cave in the past 10 years with the same shoes\/ equipment you are bringing to Carlsbad Caverns, we may ask to clean your items to protect our bats from the spread of a highly contagious and fatal bat fungus.",
