The areas that now comprise the national park system, and those that will be added in years to come, are cumulative expressions of a single national heritage. The National Park Service must manage park resources and values in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations -- 2001 NPS Management Policies.  At San Juan Island National Historical Park, staff and volunteers work together to create opportunities for visitor enjoyment while striving always to manage the park's resources so that they will remain unimpaired for future generations.
