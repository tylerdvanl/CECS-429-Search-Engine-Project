The Morristown National Historical Park Wildland Fire Management Plan, completed in 2005, is the primary planning document directing park wildland fire management activities at Morristown. These activities include preparedness planning and activities, fire staffing and training, prevention, suppression, and the use of mechanical fuel treatments to achieve management and resource management objectives. The Fire Management Plan meets the requirements of Directorâ€™s Order-18 that all NPS park units with burnable vegetation have a wildland fire management plan approved by the superintendent.
