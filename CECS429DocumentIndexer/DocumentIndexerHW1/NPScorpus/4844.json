We have been lucky in having talented photographers forward pictures they have taken at Casa Grande Ruins so that we can share them with you. You may see these wonderful gifts on the birding page. If you have visited the park and have pictures to share, please let us know. You are always welcome to use the 'contact us' link on each page.      Of course there are mammals within the park boundaries as well. The most abundant, and quite the crowd pleaser for most of the year, is the round tail ground squirrel.",
