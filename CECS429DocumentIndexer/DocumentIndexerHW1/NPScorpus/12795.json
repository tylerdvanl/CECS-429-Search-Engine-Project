    "body": "Snowplay       Snowplay Areas Wolverton 7,250 ft. (2,160 m) elevation. An open area with sledding hills two miles (3.2 km) north of the General Sherman Tree. After snowstorms, it may take several hours before plows can get the area open for the day. Cross-country skis and snowshoes are available for rent and snowplay gear is for sale at Wuksachi Lodge. Grant Grove 6,600 ft. (2,000 m) elevation. Big Stump and Columbine are in the Grant Grove section of Kings Canyon National Park. On nearby National Forest land are the Big Meadows, Quail Flat and Cherry Gap areas. Cross-country skis and snowshoes are available for rent and snowplay gear is for sale at the Grant Grove Market. Prohibited Areas Snowplay is prohibited in residential areas, the Grant Tree Trail area, the Sherman Tree Road, and other areas as signed.  Safety Hypothermia is a dangerous condition that can occur year-round. To avoid it, stay dry and snack often. If others don't respond to the need for warmer clothes or are stumbling, forgetful, or extremely tired and drowsy, get warm and sugary drinks into them immediately. Get them into dry clothing, sleeping bags, and shelter. Keep an eye on children who are wet or cold from snowplay. Safe Sledding Every year, people get hurt while sledding in these parks. Don't let an accident ruin your winter fun.  Slide feet first.  Consider wearing a helmet. After sliding, look uphill. Move out of the way of people coming downhill after you. Make sure your sliding path is clear. Don't slide near rocks, trees, branches, or other people. Watch your kids carefully. Fast sledding and collisions cause most injuries. Don't slide into roads or parking lots. Avoid hard-packed snow or ice, where speed and direction get out of control. Sledding devices that can be steered may be safer than others.",
