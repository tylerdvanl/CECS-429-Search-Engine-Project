    "body": "Kids & Youth       For Scouts! The Rangers and Volunteers at James A. Garfield National Historic Site have developed a series of exciting programs for boy scouts earning a variety of merit badges. These programs are hands-on and collaborative, giving scouts an opportunity to delve deeper into difficult topics, work with boys from other troops, and see connections between each merit badge and James A. Garfield, his family and his property which today is a national park. Each program covers several merit badge requirements, with the option for scouts to complete the pre-requisites before hand. Merit badge counselors are on hand to review activities. The 2014-2015 Merit Badge Programs are:   Citizenship in the Nation - November 22 Citizenship in the Community - January 24 Architecture - February 28 Archaeology - March 28 Citizenship in the World - July 10 American Heritage - July 18 (tentative)   These programs are free to all boy scouts. Registration is mandatory - please call 440-255-8722.  Â     These merit badges can be worked towards during programs at the James A. Garfield National Historic Site. www.scouting.org, NPS Staff",
