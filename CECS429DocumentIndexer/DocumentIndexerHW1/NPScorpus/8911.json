You won't find a bigger sand box to play in, so bring your friends!       Climbing the dunes at The Dune Climb Terry Phipps 2005      With about 35 miles of beautiful beaches along Lake Michigan on the mainland and another 30 miles of beaches on the islands, you will easily find the spot for you to walk along the lakeshore, swimming in the Lake Michigan waves, or building sand castles along the beach.  Or just lay out on the beach and soak up some of the sunshine!       Glen Haven Beach on a summer day Kerry Kelly      Tubing or canoeing down a lazy river is a great way to spend a hot summer day.  There are two rivers within the Lakeshore where you can rent tubes or boats.  Both rivers drain into Lake Michigan.  The Platte River is in the southern part of the park, and river access is along M-22 where it crosses the river.  The Crystal River is in the northern part of the park, and rentals are available along M-22 in Glen Arbor.       Getting ready to tube down the Platte River Kerry Kelly 2005      In the winter, The Dune Climb turns into a big sledding hill, so bring your sled or toboggan and zip down the dunes or go cross country skiing or snowshoeing.  Explore the winter beauty of the Lakeshore on over 50 miles of ski trails.       The Dune Climb makes a great Sledding Hill. Kerry Kelly 2006        The fastest way down the dunes is via sled, toboggan, or saucer!
