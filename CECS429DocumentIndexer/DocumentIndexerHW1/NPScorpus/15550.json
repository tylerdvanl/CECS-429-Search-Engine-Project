The Anza Trail commemorates, protects, marks, and interprets the route of the Anza Expedition of 1775-76, which established San Francisco and accelerated the colonization of California.  The 30 young families of the Anza Expedition (see list of the colonists' names and ages) traveled from present-day Mexico to become the first non-Native families to arrive overland into Alta California.    The families, under the command of Juan Bautista de Anza, traveled with 1000 head of livestock across the homelands of the Tohono O'odham, Quechan, Tongva, Chumash, and others before establishing a presidio (military fort) in the Ohlone homeland at San Francisco Bay.    The Anza Trail tells a quintessentially American story of migration, diversity, family, and sacrifice. It is the story of how our country's pioneers both relied upon Native Americans and brought a devastating impact upon their way of life.    At the same time, the story of the Anza Trail challenges many assumptions about our culture. The Anza Trail reveals that:     America's population spread from south to north, not just east to west; 1776 brought profound change to the West Coast, not just the east;and  The founding families of modern California were of diverse Native American, African, and European heritage.             Anza Ambassadors from Nogales, AZ, attend the annual Pasados del Presidio heritage event at the Presidio of San Francisco. NPS  Our Mission Statement   As a program of the National Park Service, the mission of the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail is to:    1) Share the story of the Anza Expedition, including the American Indian tribal communities impacted and encountered by the journey.    2) Support development of a continuous, 1,200-mile, multi-use, non-motorized recreation trail, parallel to the historic trail route, between Nogales, Ariz., and the San Francisco Bay Area; and    3). Serve as a link among related historic, cultural, and natural sites along the historic route, connecting people to the modern legacy of the Anza Expedition.          Our Calls to Action 1) Become an Anza Trail User Strap on your boots and hike a section of the Anza Trail.
