    "body": "Walks and Hikes       No matter your comfort level and experience, there are plenty of walking and hiking options. We consider the Klamath River as the boundary between our north and south. Start making your plans based on these questions...  Do you have less than an hour, or a full day?  What is the fitness level of your group. Which part of the parks do you want see?  Do you need easy parking, and paved roads?           Tall Trees Grove. Do you see the people?    Hiking Trails, North  Hiking Trails, South Coastal Trail sections California Trails and Greenways Conference  Walking through a redwood grove on a fog-shrouded morning can be an unforgettable experience. Sounds are reduced to the musical gurgle of water trickling amongst ferns and mossy rocks. Light ebbs with the somber mist and shafts of sun hang like cobwebs. Stillness and peace weave their spells upon the respectful traveler. More than 200 miles of trails weave through a variety of environments, including prairies, old-growth redwood forests, and beaches. In this section, we list all the hikes RNSP has to offer on three web pages. Be sure to pick up a map at the visitor center and chat with the rangers.  Elevations at RNSP range from sea level to just over 3,000 feet (1,000 m). Consistently mild temperatures make year-round exploration a possibility. Be aware that trails in the redwoods are often wet and slippery, so bring raingear and good boots for your hike. In winter, the Redwood Creek and Trestle Trails may be difficult or impossible to use. Temporary bridges open these trails in summer but are removed for the rainy season. Fern Canyon bridges are removed as well. You can hike the ¼-mile canyon but it will be a chilly experience; bring water shoes. Access to Stout Grove from Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park campground exists only in the summer via seasonal bridges. Go explore!",
