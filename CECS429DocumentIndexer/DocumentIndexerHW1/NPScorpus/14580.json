    "body": "Explore This Park    Learn About the Park     History & Culture             History & Culture       Adams National Historical Park was the home of two American presidents and subsequent generations of their descendants from 1720 to 1927.  The family's experience represented, shaped, and mirrored significant events in the social, cultural, political, and intellectual history of the nation.  The purpose of the park is to preserve and protect the grounds, homes, and personal property of four generations of the Adams family and to use these resources to interpret the history they represent and to educate and inspire current and future generations.  In addition, the Adams Memorial Society, consisting of members of the Adams family, charged the National Park Service with the distinct mission to \"foster civic virtue and patriotism\" at Adams National Historical Park.  This mission still continues today through partnerships, including those with the Adams Memorial Society, local organizations, and the city of Quincy.",
