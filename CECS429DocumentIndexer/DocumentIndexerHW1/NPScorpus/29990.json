It's a special treat to view the annual fall migration of monarch butterflies and dragonflies along Fire Island. Located along the Atlantic flyway, Fire Island National Seashore provides excellent habitat for many migratory species. All insect species are valuable to their ecosystems. Mosquitoes, for example, are a food source for some birds, fish, and dragonflies. Odonates (dragonflies and damselflies) are considered by scientist to be excellent indicators of wetland ecosystem health.
