    "body": "Characteristics of Bald Eagles       The bald eagle is one of the largest birds in the Northeast. In profile, as it flies toward you, its wings are held straight out; the more common turkey vulture soars with its wings held in a V-shape. As the eagle passes overhead, the feathers at the tips of its wings are widely separated, and its relatively short tail is usually fanned open. Height: 30 inches Weight: 8-12 pounds Wing Span: 6-7 feet Adult Color: (by about 5 years)  white head and tail dark brown body and wings bright orange-yellow beak and feet lemon yellow iris  Immature Color:  chocolate brown mottled with white black beak gradually lightens to a spotty horn color dark brown iris gradually lightens to pale yellow  Male and female eagles look identical, although females are usually the larger of the two.  Females weigh 10 - 14 pounds, while males generally weigh 8 - 10 pounds. Females have a longer beak and longer back toe. Although not common (only 1 or 2 along the Upper Delaware annually) the golden eagle is frequently mistaken for an immature bald eagle.",
