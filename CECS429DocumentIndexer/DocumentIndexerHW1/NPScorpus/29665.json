Clinton signed into law an Act creating the Oklahoma City National Memorial. Uniquely, the Act established a Oklahoma City National Memorial Trust to administer the site as a unit of the National Park System.  In 2004, President George W. Bush signed an amendment to the enabling act, which changed the Oklahoma City National Memorial from a park unit to an affiliate of the National Park Service. Operation and ownership of the Memorial became the duty of the Oklahoma City National Memorial Foundation, dissolving the Trust.",
