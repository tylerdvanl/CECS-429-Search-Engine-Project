    "body": "Required Ranger Contacts       In order to notify district rangers of research studies in the park, researchers are required to complete the Researcher Check-in form and corresponding check-out for each unique visit to Yellowstone National Park when conducting field work. Check-in's must be logged by no later than mid-night on the Sunday prior to the field start date.  This program helps to communicate to rangers and Research Permit Office staff where and when you will be working in the park. You are not required to telephone the district rangers unless your permit conditions indicate otherwise. Unique trips can be just one day or up to one month. If you are here working for more than one month at a time, please contact the Research Permit Office (307-344-2234 or 2239) for special instructions.  The Researcher Check-in and Check-out forms are fairly simple. However, you may want to review the step by step instructions for the check-in and check-out. If you have questions, please contact the Research Permit Office at (307)344-2239.",
