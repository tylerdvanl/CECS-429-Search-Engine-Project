Tour operators should download the special use permit application and return it to the park. Contact the Permit Coordinator at 864-543-4068 for more information. What is a \"Commercial Use Authorization?\"  Section 418 of the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998, Public Law 105-391, authorizes NPS, upon request, to issue commercial use authorizations to persons (referring to individuals, corporations, and other entities) to provide commercial services to Park area visitors in limited circumstances. CUAs, although used to authorize commercial services to Park area visitors, are NOT Concession Contracts. They are intended to provide a simple means to authorize suitable commercial services to visitors in Park areas in the limited circumstances in the legislation.   What is a \"Commercial Visitor Service\"?  This type of service means accommodations, facilities and services the NPS has determined to be necessary and\/or appropriate for public use and enjoyment of a Park area provided to Park area visitors for a fee or charge by person. The fee or charge paid by the visitor may be direct or indirect as part of the provision of comprehensive visitor services.   Is sub-contracting allowed under the authorization?  The National Park Service does not allow sub-contracting under this authorization and authorizations cannot be transferred.   What type of insurance is required before this authorization can be approved?  The CUA must provide commercial liability insurance against claims arising out of or resulting from the acts or omissions of the CUA operator or the CUA operator's employees, agents, or contractors, in carrying out the activities and operations required and\/or authorized under the CUA. The CUA Specialist must receive verification of general liability (and transportation insurance, if applicable) coverage before a CUA can be issued and the coverage must be maintained as current during the term of the authorization.",
