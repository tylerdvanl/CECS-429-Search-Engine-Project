    "body": "Explore This Park    Learn About the Park     Nature     Animals     Birds                 Birds       On the Monument you can see and hear common birds as well as rare or federally threatened birds that need special protection to keep their populations secure. These include northern spotted owl, bald eagle, peregrine falcon.   You are most likely to see jays, ravens, juncos, woodpeckers, thrushes. Some of these are bold 'robbers' and 'beggars'. They will try to charm or steal some food from you. Please do not ever feed our birds or any other wildlife. It is safer for you, and healthier for them, if they keep foraging for food in the forest.   Visitors ask \"Who is that punk?\" when they spot our Steller's Jay.  He sports wild blue colors, a fancy Mohawk, shouts loudly and likes to strut his stuff when everyone is watching.          NPS      Magic fans will have a special place in their hearts for our owls. Rarely seen by day visitors, the Oregon Caves is home to 5 species, Saw-Whet Owls, Spotted, Barred, Great Horned, and Screech Owls.       NPS      The biggest, Great Horned Owl, has ear tufts and is twice the size of a crow. They can lift up mammals as large as a skunk. They live in forest, woodlots, near streams, and open country. The male makes a series of hoots - Hoo! Hu-hu-hu, Hoo! Hoo! Female hoots are higher and shorter in sequence.       NPS      The smallest, Saw-Whet Owl, is a tiny, tuftless owl that is very hard to spot unless found roosting in dense young evergreens or low thickets. It feeds on small rodents and amphibians. Its call is usually a series of short sharp whistles.",
