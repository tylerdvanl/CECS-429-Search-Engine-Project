Unfortunately the postal street address (1008 W. 2nd St., Sulphur, Oklahoma) for Chickasaw NRA will send you to our administrative headquarters several blocks away from the park. These alternative settings will route you to the north entrance of the Platt Historic District. Sulphur, OK 73086 (the community immediately north of the park)  Intersections setting (closest to the park) Sulphur, OK, Hwy 7 & Hwy 177 Points of Interest setting \"Chickasaw National Recreation Area\" Coordinates setting Latitude\/Longitude Coordinates for Chickasaw National Recreation Area 34.50399, -96.94965 Individual in-park areas, such as the Platt Historic District, are not searchable. When you enter the park you will receive a park map or you can download one.            GPS CoordinatesGPS users will find coordinates for many popular park locations in the chart below. All coordinates are given in decimal degrees from WGS84 datum. When using your GPS to navigate about the park, please keep these suggestions in mind.  Obey all posted signs and park regulations. Don't blindly follow your GPS! It may know where to go but not necessarily the best way to get there (for example, some roads here are one way). An electronic device is no substitute for common sense. Be wary of accidentally travelling on private lands in order to access public areas.
