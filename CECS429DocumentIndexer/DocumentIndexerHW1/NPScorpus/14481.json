As a group, however, amphibians are semi-aquatic and water is essential for their survival. In order to successfully observe amphibians:  Walk slowly and avoid sudden movements and loud noises. Listen-Different frogs and toads \"sing\" in different months and temperatures. Spring is the perfect time to hear them. Note the size, color and patterns so identification can be successful.
