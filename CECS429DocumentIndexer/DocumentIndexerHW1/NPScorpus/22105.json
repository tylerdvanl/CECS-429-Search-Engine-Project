Previous Live Dives   December 2015: This live dive explored new shipboard locations previous not shown. Our goal was to help viewers experience the wreck as it is today, illustrate life aboard the vessel in battle and peace, and understand the world-class science behind managing this hallowed ground for future generations.    October 2015: Scott went underwater to the wreck of the USS Arizona to explain about the damage to the ship from the attack on Pearl Harbor, as well as modern-day science and conservation efforts being supported by the monument. Visitors watched the live broadcast in the visitor center theater or online via Adobe Connect.    April 2015: Our ParkEDU team hosted a live broadcast underwater, as Scott gave a tour of the USS Arizona as she rests today on the bottom of Pearl Harbor, beneath the USS Arizona Memorial. Viewers watching live submitted questions to the dive team and had them answered on-air.
