Roads created by logging, fire roads and old farm access roads have created a 43 mile (69 km) network of paved and primitive trails through the pinelands. Closed to vehicular traffic, most of these trails are simply two ruts in the limestone bedrock. They are ideal for long, leisurely hikes, and a few are open for bicycling.

The Old Ingraham Highway is a good alternative with year round access. This former road is ideal for extended hikes and bike trips. If you wish to walk or bike the entire road, be prepared for a 22 mile (35 km) round trip                      Start of the bike trail at Shark Valley NPS  Photo  J Roark   Shark Valley     The scenic loop is 15 miles (24 km) round-trip. There are no short cuts. If you become unable to complete the entire 15-mile trip, turn around and return on the same road. Bicycling the road takes an average of 2 to 3 hours. The parking lot closes at 6 PM, so be sure to allow yourself enough time. Ride your bike opposite the flow of tram traffic. Start behind the Visitor Center and follow the straight West Road.
