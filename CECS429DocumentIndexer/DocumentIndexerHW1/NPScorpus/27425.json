    "body": "Visiting Launch Facility (Missile Silo) Delta-09         As visitors look through the Delta-09 viewing enclosure at a Minuteman II missile, a Park Ranger answers questions. travelsouthdakota.com Photo  From 1963 until the early 1990s, the missile silo at Delta-09 contained a fully operational Minuteman Missile, bearing a 1.2 megaton nuclear warhead. The Delta-09 missile silo was one of 150 spread across western South Dakota. In total there were 1,000 Minuteman's deployed from the 1960's into the early 1990's. Visitors can now tour the site on their own.  The launch facility consists of a silo 12 feet in diameter and 80 feet deep made of reinforced concrete with a steel-plate liner. The door to the silo has been welded and fitted with a glass roof, and an unarmed missile placed inside. For safety reasons, tours are not conducted underground. In addition to the missile and silo, visitors will see support structures such as antennas and motion sensors. Cell Phone Tour A self-guided cell phone tour is available from early Spring through late Fall. Visitors can use their cell phones to listen to a ranger recorded tour. There are ten stops along the tour which interpret the history of the site and Minuteman missiles across the Great Plains region. Learn more...
