Teachers selected as Teacher-Rangers spend the summer working with Park staff on education projects, learning about National Parks, and developing lesson plans for use in their classrooms. The emphasis of the TRT program is to connect National Park areas with teachers and their students who may have little or no experience with National Park Service. The TRT program is administered through a cooperative agreement with the University of Colorado, Denver (CU Denver). Professional development and graduate credit hours are available through the university.   Shenandoah National Park TRT Program  Teachers selected as a TRT spend 8-10 weeks working side-by-side with park rangers on specific education-based project that varies from year to year based on the park's needs. In addition, the TRT is introduced to other park duties such as presenting interpretive programs for the general public, staffing the visitor center information desk, or helping with resource management projects.  TRTs must commit to approximately 230 hours and are automatically enrolled in an on-line graduate course through CU Denver. The tuition is paid by the National Park Service. TRTs are required to submit at least one lesson plan as part of the graduate course. The TRT receives a stipend for successful completion of TRT program commitments.   Once they return to their schools, teacher-rangers bring their national park knowledge and experiences into the school and classrooms throughout the school year to engage students, faculty, and staff in lessons and activities that relate to Shenandoah National Park and other national park sites.
