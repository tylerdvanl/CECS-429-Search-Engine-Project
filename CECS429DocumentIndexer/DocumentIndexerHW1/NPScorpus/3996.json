In the private sector, the interview is key. In the Federal sector, the Federal application form is key. The better your written application, the greater your chances are for a higher rating.  The OF-612, Optional Application for Federal Employment, may be used. A resume may be used, however, if the resume does not contain ALL the information requested in the OF-612, you may lose consideration for a job since the application is used in a rating process. Visit the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) website at www.usajobs.opm.gov for access to the OF-612. From this address, click on to \"On-Line Application\". If you do not have Internet access, you may request an OF-612 from the Human Resources Office. Be familiar with the type of position you are applying to. Read the vacancy announcement. More specifically, by reading the brief description of duties and the identified Knowledges, Abilities, Skills and Other Characteristics (KASOCS), or (KSA's) as they are also referred to, this will assist you in becoming familiar with the job and better describe your paid and\/or non-paid working experience. Remember: Failure to provide a well-written and conclusive application may result in loss of consideration for the job. Note: The OF-612, under item number 8 - Work Experience, asks you to describe your paid and non-paid work experience related to the job for which you are applying. The form provides enough space for two working experiences, however, this does not mean that you are limited to providing only two working experiences. All your working experiences are critical toward determining eligibility and qualifying you for the position you are applying to. Attach additional copies of the OF-612 or use blank paper if you have more than two working experiences.",
