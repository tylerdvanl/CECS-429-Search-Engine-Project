The two-part program introduces students to the methods and theories of fieldwork in historical archaeology. Students participate in all aspects of field and lab work: laying out units, excavation by shovel and trowel, mapping, drawing, photography, and cleaning, identifying, and analyzing artifacts. The season also includes a lecture series featuring guest speakers and staff.
