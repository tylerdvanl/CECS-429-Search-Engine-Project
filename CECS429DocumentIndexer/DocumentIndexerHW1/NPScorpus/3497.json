Geology  Glen Canyon National Recreation Area is part of the Colorado Plateau geographical and ecological province. Different environments over a period of 300 million years laid down layer upon layer of sedimentary materials, primarily sandstones and mudstones. Approximately 5 million years ago this region was uplifted, thus forming the Colorado Plateau. The Colorado River and its tributaries carved through the plateau's layers, creating Glen Canyon.
