Great birdwatching sites include the various stops along Hwy 117 down the east side of the monument, particularly the Las Ventanas and Narrows Picnic Areas, and the El Calderon trialhead on Hwy 53 south of Grants. These sites provide a variety of habitat - sandstone cliffs, shortgrass prairies, and rugged volcanic landscapes to the east, and pine forests to the west. More information on birds and birding sites in El Malpais can be found in our downloadable birding guide & checklist.         A volunteer scans the North Pasture area for birds.

It is not uncommon to see many different raptors including bald and golden eagles, red tailed hawks, prairie falcons, American kestrels and many more.        Greater Roadrunner Photo Dale Dombrowski  Greater Roadrunner  The Greater Roadrunner (Geococcyx californianus) is a large ground dwelling bird with a brown, white and buff body and a shaggy, crested head. Roadrunners are members of the cuckoo family and can reach speeds of up to 18 miles per hour when running. Many people believe the roadrunner is flightless, but this is a myth. Roadrunners eat scorpions, snakes, spiders and a number of other small animals. Roadrunners are fast enough to catch rattlesnakes and may even team up with one another to subdue large snakes. They have expanded their range in the U.S. and can be found from Louisiana to California. The roadrunner is the state bird of New Mexico.",
