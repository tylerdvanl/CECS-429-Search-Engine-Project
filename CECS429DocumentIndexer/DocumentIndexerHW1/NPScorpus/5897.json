    "body": "Preservation and Stabilization of the Thomas Farm Blacksmith Shop Ruins         Excavations at blacksmith shop   Historic references indicate that a blacksmith shop was in operation at the Thomas Farm by the 19th century; it is mentioned in several historic references, including an 1856 advertisement in the Frederick Examiner. The Thomas Farm blacksmith shop was a stone structure measuring 16 by 35 feet, and is located along an early road trace to the rear of the Thomas House. Archeological excavations were undertaken at the ruins of the blacksmith shop in 2007, and helped refine the original footprint and layout of the building, including an interior partition wall and a 12-foot door opening. The remains of the brick forge were also recovered, along with a wide variety of artifacts.          Masons work on blacksmith shop   In spring 2008, stone masons stabilized and repointed extant wall segments to prevent further deterioration. In addition, sections of wall that were identified archeologically were rebuilt so that they are visible above-grade, visually delineating the original footprint of the blacksmith shop. Completion of this project will help prevent further deterioration of the ruins, and will also help preserve the site for future researchers. Preservation and stabilization of the Thomas Farm blacksmith shop was performed by the National Park Service's Historic Preservation Training Center (HPTC). HPTC is headquartered at Monocacy National Battlefield in the historic Gambrill House.                   Thomas House Dormer Repairs   8 Photos            Worthington House Restoration   5 Photos            Thomas House Roof Project   6 Photos              Best Farm Main House   11 Photos            Best Farm Secondary House   10 Photos            2008 Monument Projects   15 Photos              Best Farm Stone Barn Preservation   13 Photos            Thomas Farm Blacksmith Shop Project   4 Photos            Thomas Bank Barn \/ Silo Restoration   15 Photos              14th New Jersey Monument Project   13 Photos",
