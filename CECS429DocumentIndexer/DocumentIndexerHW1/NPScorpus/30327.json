    "body": "Bookstore - Cooperating Association         NPS staff  Purchasing items from the Eastern National bookstore at the James A. Garfield NHS Visitor Center is another way to support your park. Each book and souvenir is chosen because of it's interpretive connection to the Garfield site, and it's ability to tell part of the Garfield story. Several pieces are inspired by pieces from the Garfield home, including the beautifully reproduced fireplace tiles from the dining room, originally hand-painted by Mrs. Garfield. (shown at right)  A portion of each sale at our Eastern National bookstore goes to support programs at James A. Garfield NHS. Please check here first when you desire a unique gift from a national park!",
