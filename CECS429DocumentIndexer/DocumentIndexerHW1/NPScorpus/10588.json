Each of these places has a natural environment, combined with an overlay of cultural features, that give it its character. The natural environment is described in \"Natural Features & Ecosystems.\" Structures have been built on many islands. On most of the larger islands, people have changed the land over time. Some sites are valued because of long use by people; others for the evidence of past use that they hold. The places in the cultural environment of the Boston Harbor islands are described in the sections linked above:  Buildings & Structures Cultural Landscapes Ethnographic & Archeological Sites (\"Other\")  \"Island Facts\" presents the size, location, managing agency, facilities, natural history, historical sketch...and more for each island in the park.",
