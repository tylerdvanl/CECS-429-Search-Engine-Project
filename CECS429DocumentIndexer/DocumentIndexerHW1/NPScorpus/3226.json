It is always interesting to hear new residents and visitors protest about the lack of seasons here in the desert. Interestingly, this part of the Sonoran Desert actually has five seasons. Learn more about the Desert Seasons. Winter Season - Late Fall to Early Spring Programs With daytime temperature from the low 50's to the high 70's, Saguaro National Park is the perfect place to join one of our guided walks or informative talks. These activities are offered throughout the busy winter season (November through March). Interpretive programs vary from easy strolls through a cactus garden to strenuous hikes.*   Summer Season - Late Spring to Early Fall Programs As we get deeper into the summer season, temperatures will range from mid-80's to low 100's. This is a great time to experience the desert as the day breaks or in the late of the day as the sun disappears behind the surrounding mountain ranges. During the late spring and summer months Saguaro National Park only offers interpretive programs on an intermittent basis.* *Some interpretive programs are accessible to persons with physical disabilities or require a reservation to participate. This information will be noted on the schedule along with a phone number to make a reservation or get more information. Schedules are subject to change - please call the visitor centers for updates.",
