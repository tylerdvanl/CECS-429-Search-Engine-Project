Fort Raleigh National Historic Site is a great place for kids. Kids can see the restored 1585 earthwork and visualize what life was like back then, can explore the Thomas Hariot Nature Trail and imagine the hardships faced by both the native Algonquian people and the foreign English colonists as they made homes in the wilderness, can discover the variety of plants and animals found throughout the site as scientist Thomas Hariot did in 1585, can pretend to be a Civil War soldier fighting for control of Roanoke Island or to be a member of the freedmen’s colony struggling to begin a new life. Every Kid in a Park This initiative allows every fourth-grade student and her or his family to visit over 2,000 federal lands—such as national parks, national forests, and national wildlife refuges—for free!
