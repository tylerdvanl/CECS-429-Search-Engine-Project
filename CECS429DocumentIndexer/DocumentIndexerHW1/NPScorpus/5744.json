Courtesy- Jan Shirey   Â    Big Cypress National Preserve is home to many mammals, birds, and reptiles unique to Florida's climate. It is easy to view and appreciate Florida's largest reptile, the American alligator, living here in its natural environment. Anhingas, egrets, and herons are found in plentiful numbers feeding, displaying courtship feathers, and nesting in and among the cypress trees. Occasionally, one can witness river otter, bobcats, black bear, and the endangered Florida panther on the Preserve's back roads and trails.",
