    "body": "Volunteer       Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve is managed by the staff of Katmai National Park and Preserve from National Park Service headquarters in King Salmon, AK. Volunteers may occasionally help out at Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve with various aspects of park management including resource management and archeological field work. Some of our volunteers work through the Student Conservation Association (SCA). Volunteer positions are somewhat limited due to lack of housing. Positions are usually filled by March for the following summer season. For more information on the volunteer program at Aniakchak, contact us.
