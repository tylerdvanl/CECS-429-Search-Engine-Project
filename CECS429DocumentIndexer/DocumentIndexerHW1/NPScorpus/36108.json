Failure to obtain the CUA Permit may result in the issuance of a fine and\/or removal from the park.  Commercial Use Authorizations (CUAs) are one method of authorizing commercial visitor services.   CUAs are issued for one year. CUAs are issued for an annual fee. The current fee is $25. Permittee must reapply for a new CUA for subsequent periods upon expiration of the current CUA. There is no right or guarantee of renewal. Commercial business activity is prohibited within the park unless a CUA has been granted by the park.  If you are a non-profit organization without taxable income, under the new National Park Service guidelines you are not required to obtain a Commercial Use Authorization. However, you are required to obtain a Special Use Permit.  Application Process  Please download a Commercial Use Authorization  (110 KB) application form and follow application instructions.
