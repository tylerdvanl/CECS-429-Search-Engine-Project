    "title": "Yellowstone National Park: Biennial Scientific Conferences",
    "body": "Biennial Scientific Conferences       The Greater Yellowstone biennial scientific conference series, initiated in 1991, encourages awareness and application of wide-ranging, high-caliber scientific work on the region's natural and cultural resources. These conferences, with the active involvement of professional societies and other institutions, provide a much-needed forum for knowledge-sharing among hundreds of researchers, park managers, and the general public. They attract world-class speakers and are interdisciplinary by design. These proceedings volumes are perhaps the single most significant new source of scientific information on Greater Yellowstone in the history of the region.      Building on the Past, Leading into the Future: Sustaining the GYE in the Coming Century  Oct. 4-6, 2016 - Conference Information   Crossing Boundaries: Science, Management & Conservation in the Greater Yellowstone October 6-8, 2014 - Conference Information  Greater Yellowstone in Transition: Linking Science and Decision Making 2012 - Yellowstone Science issue dedicated to the conference (14.8 MB PDF)  Questioning Greater Yellowstone's Future: Climate, Land Use, and Invasive Species 2010 - Conference Proceedings (12 MB PDF)  The '88 Fires: Yellowstone and Beyond 2008 - Conference Proceedings (4.51 MB PDF)  Greater Yellowstone Public Lands: A Century of Discovery, Hard Lessons, and Bright Prospects 2005 - Conference Proceedings (4.8 MB PDF)  Beyond the Arch: Community and Conservation in Greater Yellowstone and East Africa 2003 - Conference Proceedings (16.6 MB PDF)  Yellowstone Lake: Hotbed of Chaos or Reservoir of Resilience 2001 - Conference Proceedings (3.4 MB PDF)  Exotic Organisms in Greater Yellowstone: Native Biodiversity Under Siege 1999 - Conference Proceedings Links  People and Place: The Human Experience in Greater Yellowstone 1997 - Conference Proceedings (3.0 MB PDF)  Greater Yellowstone Predators: Ecology and Conservation in a Changing Landscape 1995 - Conference Proceedings (12.4 MB PDF)  The Ecological Implications of Fire in Greater Yellowstone 1993 - Conference Proceedings (13.0 MB PDF)  Plants and Their Environments 1991 - Conference Proceedings (6.2 MB)        More Information  Science & Research in Yellowstone",
