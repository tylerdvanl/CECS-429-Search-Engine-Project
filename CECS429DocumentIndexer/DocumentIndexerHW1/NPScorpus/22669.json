While this might bring excitement to your camping experience, please remember that a bear that has become habituated to humans and their food will ultimately need to be killed.  Follow these simple procedures in our campgrounds: • Use the bear-proof storage lockers provided to secure food and any scented products like beverages (other than water), toothpaste, deodorant, tobacco, sunscreen, bug repellant etc. Do not store these items in your tent or pop-up trailer.  • If lockers are full or not available, secure food and scented items in your locked vehicle with windows rolled up.  • Clean up your campsite and table after eating.  • Lock the dumpsters at South Rim after depositing your trash.",
