But when winter returns, they fly south to escape the cold. For many of these species, populations are declining as sufficient habitat is becoming scarce. The loss in species population not only affects Vermont's ecosystems, but also affects the ecosystems of the tropical wintering grounds as fewer numbers of these birds are migrating south.  Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park has partnered with Change the World Kids to develop a service learning project for youth. The project focuses on the migratory songbirds that breed in the National Park and winter in Costa Rica, where Change the World Kids travel every year to help with reforestation efforts.
