The geography of the island itself is in a state of constant flux, continuously being reshaped by the elemental forces of wind and water. Powerful storms can dramatically alter the shoreline in a matter of hours, as waves wash over the beach and reshape the island from ocean to bay. Other forces sculpt the landscape in less obvious ways. Exposure to salt spray, lack of fresh water, and isolation from the mainland are subtle, but powerful influences on the Island's species composition. Over time, these conditions have produced a community of plants and animals uniquely suited to the extremes found at the edge of the sea. Human activities also exert a strong influence Assateague's natural environment. Beginning in the 1600's, colonists used the Island for grazing horses and other livestock. The bands of wild horses living on Assateague today are descendents of those domesticated animals and remain a powerful force acting on the island's natural systems. At various times in its history, fishing villages, industrial sites, and even a network of lifesaving stations for stranded mariners have all left their marks. Then as now, the dynamic nature of the island continues to manifest itself in both subtle and dramatic ways, giving Assateague its unique and special character.",
