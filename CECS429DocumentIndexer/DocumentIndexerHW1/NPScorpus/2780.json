    "body": "Cottonwood Cove Floating Green Building        The first floating green building registered for LEED certification. The building serves as the Cottonwood Cove Marina and Resort's marina services office where boat renters are welcomed. NPS Photo \/ Andrew S. Muñoz          This groundbreaking - well more like water displacing - structure is the first floating building ever constructed to U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) standards and registered to seek LEED Gold certification. LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is an internationally recognized green building certification system developed by the USGBC. The structure serves as the Cottonwood Cove Marina and Resort marina services building. Park visitors will be welcomed here by Forever Resorts staff before they venture out on their rental boat or houseboat vacation. It also serves as an example of sustainable construction. Constructed for the National Park Service by its partner and concessionaire Forever Resorts, the floating eco-friendly structure features sustainable modular construction and state-of-the-art energy-efficient and environmentally responsible materials and fixtures.                        Building Features A short tour of the eco-friendly features of the Cottonwood Cove marina services building.  Duration:35 seconds                 The decking system is 100% recyclable. It's composed of 55% rice hulls (renewable resource) and 45% recycled plastic. The factory manufacturing process reduces its carbon footprint by using less electricity and recirculating water. Heat generated from the production equipment is captured and used in the factory. NPS Photo \/ Andrew S. Muñoz  Decking is made of a composite of rice hulls and recycled plastic and the exterior stucco is made of recycled tires. Use of low or no volatile organic compound materials, paints and adhesives will rid the building of the typical new building smell, improving the overall indoor air quality. Additionally, every piece of leftover material was tracked to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills and ensure maximimum reuse or recycling. The project's key earth-minded elements and commitments include the integration of the concessionaire's environmental management systems and a mix of new and existing programs:  Green Cleaning Program throughout the resort (currently in place) Green Purchasing Program (currently in place) Energy and Environmental Education Programs for boaters and community members (currently in place) Extensive energy saving materials and systems, including high-performance insulated glass High-efficient HVAC equipment and delivery systems Extensive use of recycled and regionally extracted and\/or manufactured materials, such as concrete, steel, drywall, metal studs, carpet, etc. Finish materials, paints, adhesives, caulks and sealants that contain low or no volatile organic compounds to ensure healthy indoor air quality Extensive natural daylight and views to the outdoors throughout, maximizing east\/west orientation Recycled and recyclable building and landscape materials Prevention of night sky pollution  The structure is designed to last over 40 years without significant maintenance.",
