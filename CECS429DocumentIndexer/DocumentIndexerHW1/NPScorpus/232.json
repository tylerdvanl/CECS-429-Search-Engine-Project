    "body": "\"When you pray with this pipe, you pray for and with everything.\"Â  -Black Elk  For countless generations, American Indians have quarried the red pipestone found at this site. These grounds are sacred to many people because the pipestone quarried here is carved into pipes used for prayer. Many believe that the pipe's smoke carries one's prayer to the Great Spirit. The traditions of quarrying and pipemaking continue here today.              Active Pipestone Quarry   Pipestone quarry showing tools, quartzite rubble, and depth of quarry.
