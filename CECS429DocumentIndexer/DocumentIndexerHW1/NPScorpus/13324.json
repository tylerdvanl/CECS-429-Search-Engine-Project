    "body": "Trail Descriptions       The Yosemite Wilderness has over 750 miles of trail to explore. In planning a wilderness trip, it is important to find the right trip for your interests, time frame, and abilities. A good planning process will enhance your understanding of the park and your safety. Therefore, as part of the wilderness experience, park rangers can provide general guidance but will not plan a wilderness trip for you; you must plan your own trip.  When you have thought about or decided what you want from your trip, you can start planning and researching your hike. A detailed topographic map is a must for any hike. In addition, a good guidebook can help you choose a trip that is right for you. For books and maps, please visit the non-profit Yosemite Conservancy's bookstore. Remember that visiting the Wilderness is an adventure: do not be afraid to explore a new area and discover what wonders it has to offer! You can find brief descriptions and mileages for trails by downloading this PDF [400 kb]. The trailhead information page has more information about each trailhead. Additionally, below are links to all of the US Geological Survey 7.5-minute topographic maps that cover Yosemite National Park. Please note that some of these maps are several years old and some information on them may be out of date. Each PDF file is about 10 MB.",
