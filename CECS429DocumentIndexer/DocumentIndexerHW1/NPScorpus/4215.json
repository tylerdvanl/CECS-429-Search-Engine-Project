    "body": "Pets       Everglades National Park encompasses 1.5 million acres, of which most is a designated wilderness. It is also an area where many family and community group activities take place; ranging from boating, hiking, camping and participating in ranger-led programs. Pets often come with us to share in leisure time. There are trails and areas of the park accessible to pets and service animals. Due to the concern for wildlife management issues, Everglades National Park’s regulation allows the closing of an area to the use of pets and service animals if it is determined that these pose a direct threat to the health or safety of people or wildlife. To determine whether a pet poses a direct threat, individualized assessments based on current scientific knowledge or on the best available objective evidence to ascertain the nature, duration and severity of the risks have been taken into account and less restrictive measures will not suffice. Currently pets are permitted in the following areas: • On roadways open to public vehicular traffic • In roadside campgrounds and picnic areas • On the maintained grounds surrounding public facilities and residential areas • Aboard boats. *All pets must be on a leash not to exceed six feet and under close supervision, even in designated areas.  Note: Pets present in areas not permitted, open themselves to predation by wildlife as well as posing a significant danger to the handler and other visitors. For additional information call 305-242-7700 or read the Everglades Compendium listing current park-wide laws and policies.",
