Fishing is prohibited on Rock Creek north of the Porter Street bridge. Hitchhiking is prohibited within all areas of the park. Removing or damaging natural or cultural resources is prohibited.   Unmanned Aircraft   The term \"unmanned aircraft\" means a device that is used or intended to be used for flight in the air without the possibility of direct human intervention from within or on the device, and the associated operational elements and components that are required for the pilot or system operator in command to operate or control the device (such as cameras, sensors, communication links). This term includes all types of devices that meet this definition (e.g., model airplanes, quadcopters, drones) that are used for any purpose, including for recreation or commerce. Launching, landing, or operating an unmanned aircraft from or on lands and waters administered by the National Park Service within the boundaries of Rock Creek Park is prohibited except as approved in writing by the Superintendent. Justification: Rock Creek Park (United States Reservation 339) was founded in 1890 by the U.S. Congress as \"a public park or pleasure ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of the United States.\" The founding legislation also noted that the management of Rock Creek Park, which transferred to the National Park Service in 1933, \"shall provide for the preservation from injury or spoliation of all timber, animals, or curiosities within said park, and their retention in their natural condition, as nearly as possible.\" Under NPS Management Policies, the impact of the use of unmanned aircraft over Rock Creek Park on soundscapes, vistas, cultural landscapes, migratory birds, critical migratory bird habitat and other features of the park that must remain in the condition mandated by Congress must be assessed before the park can contemplate their use. Rock Creek Park currently administers over 3,000 acres in 99 federal reservations stretching across the northwest and northeast quadrants of Washington, DC. Unmanned aircraft use throughout these reservations is prohibited until NPS can make a determination of the security concerns and possible impacts from an unmannedaircraft launched from within Rock Creek Park on areas adjacent to or surrounded by National Park Service land. These include the Federal Aviation Administration's Prohibited Area P-56B, adjacent to Dumbarton Oaks Park, Whitehaven Parkway, Normanstone Parkway, and sections of Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway;the 41 foreign missions thatborder these reservations along Reservation 339, Civil War Defenses of Washington, Whitehaven Parkway, Normanstone Parkway, Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway, Klingle Valley, Melvin Hazen Park, and Glover Archbold Park, among other reservations;the United States Department of Homeland Security Headquarters, which borders Glover Archbold Park and the Civil War Defenses of Washington;Federal Aviation Administration communications facilities, located on Civil War Defenses of Washington land;United States Army Corps of Engineers drinking water processing facilities and reservoirs adjacent to Potomac Palisades;and DC Water reservoir and drinking water processing facilities bounded by Civil War Defenses of Washington land. The preservation of the reverential and contemplative atmosphere of Battleground National Cemetery, at which 41 Union veterans of the Civil War Battle of Fort Stevens are interred, must also be considered in the assessment of this new use. Given the requirement under NPS management Policies 2006 that any new use must be assessed for appropriateness and possible impacts, less restrictive measures that would allow any use of an unmanned aircraft will not suffice.   II. 36 CFR §1.6 - ACTIVITIES THAT REQUIRE A PERMIT   NOTE: The term \"permit\" covers a variety of instruments allowing us to manage activities within Rock Creek Park.
