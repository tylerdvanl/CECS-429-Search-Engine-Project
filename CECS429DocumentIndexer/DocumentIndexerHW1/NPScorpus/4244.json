Strom  National Parks are special places that protect nature and history for future generations. That's a lofty goal, but there's nothing that says lofty goals can't be accompanied by a little fun! There are all kinds of fun activities in national parks, and Biscayne is no exception. Many of those activities are covered in other parts of this site, including canoeing and kayaking, snorkeling, camping, fishing, and more. On top of all that, the park has a signature program with \"Fun\" as its middle name! Check out the Family Fun Fest page for more details!",
