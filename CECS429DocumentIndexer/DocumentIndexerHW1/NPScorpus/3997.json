    "body": "Everglades Artist in Residence Program       Spanning the southern tip of the Florida peninsula and most of Florida Bay, Everglades National Park is the only subtropical wilderness in North America. It is known for its rich wildlife, particularly large wading birds, and it is the only place in the world where both alligators and crocodiles coexist. The Everglades National Park Artist in Residence in Everglades (AIRIE) program offers artists the opportunity to live and work in this unique environment for a period of up to one month. The works completed under this program will contribute to the public understanding and appreciation of Everglades National Park. It is hoped that these works will characterize the Everglades for present and future generations, giving park visitors and the general public an opportunity to see our heritage through the eyes, and ears of the contributing artists.          AIRIE Introduction   AIRIE Eligibility     AIRIE Expectations   AIRIE Housing     AIRIE Selection Process   How to Apply to AIRIE                 The artists in residence program at Everglades National Park is funded entirely by contributions to the National Park Service from individuals and private foundations.
