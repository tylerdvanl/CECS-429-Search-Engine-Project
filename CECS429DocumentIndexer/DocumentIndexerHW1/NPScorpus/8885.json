The legal mandates, health of the habitats within the park, preservation of the cultural and historical heritage, and public input all are considered in planning for each new project. Planning, Environment and Public Comment (PEPC) The National Park Service relies heavily on your input to help guide the stewardship of America's great natural and cultural resources. Our new, web-based software-Planning, Environment and Public Comment (PEPC)-provides a way to review and comment on many plans and projects throughout the national park system. PEPC also helps facilitate communication among National Park Service employees, creating greater efficiencies. The web-based platform allows parks nationwide to easily share information on projects even when they are time zones apart. The software also helps project leaders better manage and track projects. You don't need to live close to a park to get involved with its planning activities. If you are a park neighbor, visitor or a distant admirer, PEPC makes it easy to comment on proposed or current projects by allowing you to post your comments on projects throughout the national park system.
