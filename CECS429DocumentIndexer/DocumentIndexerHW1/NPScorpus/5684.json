    "body": "Backcountry Volunteer       The goal of the Backcountry Volunteer Program is to increase the ability of the National Park Service to contact, assist and educate visitors in the Preserve backcountry, assist with minor trail maintenance as needed and aid in the monitoring of the backcountry trail system. Backcountry Volunteers are trained in the use of off-road vehicles and travel along backcountry trails that allow for off-road vehicle use assisting and educating visitors as needed. Volunteers perform minor trail maintenance and identify major trail issues that need to be addressed. Backcountry Volunteers are customer service oriented, enjoy the outdoors, have a basic understanding of backcountry travel and are good team players. Prior knowledge of Big Cypress trails and off-road vehicles is beneficial for these volunteers, but not necessary. To become part of the program, a short training commitment is required.
