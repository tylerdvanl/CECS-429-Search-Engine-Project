(Summer Only)         Welcome to the Roosevelt-Vanderbilt Geocaching Program!  Geocaching is an outdoor recreational activity that uses a GPS unit or smartphone to locate hidden containers, called geocaches.  However, some geocaches require solving a puzzle or answering questions about an area's history or natural resources.  If you are new to geocaching, you may want to begin by checking out Geocaching 101, an official guide to the game.  Participants may register for a free basic membership at www.geocaching.com to search for geocaches and share stories about those geocaches they find.  The following geocaches are located at Eleanor Roosevelt N.H.S, Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt N.H.S, and Vanderbilt Mansion N.H.S:                · Beatrix Farrand Garden  ·Italian Gardens   · FDR's Bird Collection  · New York Central Railroad   · FDR's Tree Plantations  ·Strike and Dip in Hyde Park   ·Ice Pond  ·Top Cottage           Cell Phone Tours  You can experience more history about the park and surrounding area on your phone.
