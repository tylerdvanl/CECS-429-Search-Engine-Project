The Power of Words and Images From July 11 - July 22, 2016, twenty-four teens will explore the power of language and images where some of the most enduring documents in American history were drafted.  Project Write students will visit the past each day, discovering park sites and stories still relevant to the lives of American teens today.  We'll end our journey each day in the present - blogging, tweeting and using digital images and video to inspire future generations.  Please join us on this journey!      Learn about typical Project Write activities Just what do Project Write students do each day? Check out our syllabus. Students spend a portion of each morning visiting sites in the national park, and in the city. Students write in the park and in the classroom. And, we have fun!        The Project Write Blog The 2016 blog will be active from July 7 through July 22.  We hope you'll share your thoughts on the meaning of liberty, equality, community and power with our students as they try to answer the question, \"What does freedom look like?\".
