Permits are FREE and must be acquired in person at either the Painted Desert Visitor Center, Painted Desert Inn, or Rainbow Forest Museum, at least an hour before the park closes.   Most backpackers hike into the Painted Desert Wilderness Area at the north end of the park. Parking, facilities, and an access trail are available at Painted Desert Inn. Backpackers must hike north of Lithodendron Wash (1 mile from the access trailhead) before setting up camp. There is a southern unit of Wilderness Area with a very different character, accessible from a pullout off the main park road.  Groups Group camping is limited to 8. Because of the fragile soils and landscape features, minimum impact camping is very important. This includes limiting the number of people within an area.  See LNT.org to learn about the principles of Leave No Trace camping.
