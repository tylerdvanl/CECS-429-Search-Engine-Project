What to Bring On Guided Activities - Hikes and Canoe\/Kayaking trips   Sturdy foot gear is a must for all but the very easiest of hikes. Everyone should have good boots, with strong support, to help prevent ankle injuries.    Bring water with you! The Great Plains can get very hot in the summer.    Mosquitoes and flies can be bothersome. Come prepared with repellent to meet some of the Missouri National Recreational River's smallest wildlife species.    A couple of hours of hiking or paddling can expose you to more sun and UV rays than normal. Wear a hat and sunscreen. It will help keep you cool and prevent a sunburned scalp!    For paddling activities, strap-on sandals or water shoes are preferable to flip-flops.    Wear closed-toe shoes and your helmet for bicycle programs.    Weather can change quickly. Come prepared with rain gear for summer showers.    Bring something to eat while you are on the trail or water. If you are on a hike around the noon hour, you'll get mighty hungry without lunch. Remember, if you pack it in, pack it out.    Children 10 or younger are welcome on interpretive activities, but must be accompanied by an adult.    Come prepared to have a great time!",
