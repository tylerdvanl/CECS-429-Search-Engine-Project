It includes some 60,000 objects ranging from valuable high style furniture and fine art to a rusty coffee can, with lots in between. The historic site also holds a rich documentary record of the Ridgely family, described on the Archives page.        NPS  All but a handful of these objects were purchased by the Ridgely family and used in the house, making it truly a glimpse into the tastes, values, and activities of one Maryland family through the years.        NPS  The landscape is a rare surviving ensemble from a late ante-bellum slave estate. Six state champion trees, a huge terraced garden, and over twenty buildings, including slave quarters give visitors a glimpse of the layout of a great slave estate. This material culture reveals the non material culture of those who designed it, built it, and lived and died in it.         See the park's museum collection profile See Hampton's \"Treasure of the Nation\" Visit other National Register sites in Baltimore",
