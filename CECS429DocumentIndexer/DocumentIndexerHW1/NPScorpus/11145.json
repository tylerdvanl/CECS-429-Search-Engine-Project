    "body": "Volunteer Spotlight       Liz Ferry, Visitor Services Representative  Meet Visitor Services Representative Liz Ferry, who has volunteered at Frederick Law Olmsted National Historic Site since 2003. Liz has held down the Monday morning shift since she arrived here that year, serving as a front-line contact with the public, whether in-person or via the telephone.   A Brookline, Massachusetts resident, Liz was introduced to the site by attending one of the Holiday Open Houses held here annually before the site closed in 2005 for a major preservation construction project. When her time became flexible some time after the Open House, she thought volunteering at Fairsted would be an interesting way to spend some time each week.  What keeps Liz coming to Fairsted are the passion many visitors have for Frederick Law Olmsted and the satisfaction of working with the site's paid staff that \"appreciate(s) my small contribution!\" In addition, she has enjoyed field trips to area sites of interest organized periodically for the volunteers. \"What an unexpected bonus for a four-hour stint once a week! Loved Adams National Historic Park especially because of the range of history involved and the beauty of the gardens and library.\" Liz also recalls the thrill of walking across the award-winning Leonard Zakim- Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge in Boston before it opened to vehicular traffic.   She also reports another benefit from volunteering at the site: learning about Olmsted's work around the country outside of his well-known Boston (Emerald Necklace) and New York (Central Park) designs. She further has become more familiar with the National Park Service and has made a point of visiting other NPS sites. She has made several visits to Joshua Tree National Park since 2003 and has been struck by the spring desert flower blooms there.  Liz's outside hobbies include cooking as well as being a news junkie and a self-described Italophile. She has made seven trips to Italy over the past 10 years and took Italian lessons for two years with her husband Mike to help make their trips smoother and more meaningful.   We continue to appreciate Liz's tireless presence, warmth, and enthusiasm.                 Â    \"I feel such a sense of accomplishment when a visitor gives me positive feedback. I feel particularly proud when a visitor tells me they 'learned a lot.'\"     -Caeden Byrnie, Interpretation Ambassador Volunteer",
