Slaven's Roadhouse is an optional dog drop for Yukon Quest mushers.During the Yukon Quest, while staying at Slaven's, we ask the mushers to sign the poster that the students left messages on. This year, we also recorded several mushers sending messages back to the class, and after the race concluded, showed this video to the class. The class was overjoyed to see mushers they followed in the 2016 Yukon Quest at Slaven's Roadhouse, and even more excited to see some leaving video messages for the students.NPS\/Dev Dharm Khalsa & Sean Tevebaugh  Duration:4 minutes, 44 seconds                                2015 Yukon Quest at Slaven's Roadhouse Each year, Slaven's Roadhouse in Yukon-Charley Rivers National Park serves as an official dog drop for the Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race, a 1,000 mile journey between Whitehorse, Yukon Territory and Fairbanks, Alaska. Well known to be one of the toughest sled dog races in the world, the Yukon Quest trail crosses some of North America's most beautiful yet unforgiving winter terrain. At Slaven's Roadhouse, mushers have the chance to take a break from their arduous journey to enjoy hot food, warm hospitality, and a quick, much needed rest. This is made possible by a dedicated team of NPS employees and Yukon Quest staff. This video shows what it's like to work at Slaven's during the Yukon Quest.NPS\/Dev Dharm Khalsa & Stacia Backensto  Duration:5 minutes, 16 seconds               The following videos can also be viewed on our YukonCharleyRiversNPS YouTube Channel.
