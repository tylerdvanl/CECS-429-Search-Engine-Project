NPS \/ Mark Thompson  Kenai Fjords National Park sits at the edge of the North Pacific Ocean, where storm patterns develop and feed a land of ice. The Harding Icefield crowns the park and is the source of at least 38 glaciers that flow over the land, sculpting as they go. These gigantic rivers of ice have shaped the terrain and are now receding to reveal their work. As ice melts, rock is uncovered and the process of succession begins to take place. Scientists in the park investigate such diverse topics as newly colonized nunataks, black bear genetics, and the reproductive success of shorebirds.      Newsletter  Resource Management Newsletter - Summer 2015 PDF (5.3 MB) Resource Management Newsletter - Summer 2014  PDF (7.64 MB)      .
