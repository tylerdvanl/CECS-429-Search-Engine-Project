NPS Photo      Check the News Releases page for more information and to determine if any closures are in effect.   Security Closures  At the request of the U.S. Secret Service there may be temporary partial park closures due to increased security measures.    Seasonal Road Closures  Beginning in November and continuing into March, portions of Park roads will be closed. Closing the north section of Manahan Road during winter substantially reduces the need for gravel replacement on the historic roadway, preserves the adjacent native plant environment, and enhances visitor safety while allowing opportunities for cross-country skiing and sledding.    Closing portions of Park Central Road to vehicle traffic enhances visitor and provides opportunities for cross country skiing. The usable life of Park Central Road is extended and the road surface remains in better condition since this portion of the road, which is designed and built for light vehicle traffic does not suffer the negative impacts of plowing and the application of de-icing chemicals.    Safety Closures  Catoctin Mountain Park is impacted by storms and occasionally portions of the park and park roads may be closed to allow for visitor safety and for safe cleanup of storm damage. The tail end of hurricanes and winter ice storms often result in downed trees and occasional flooding.",
