    "body": "Geocaching          Geocaching is a challenging outdoor game for global positioning system (GPS) users. Participating in a cache hunt is an activity designed to take advantage of the features and capability of a GPS unit and enjoy the outdoors. Individuals and organizations set up caches all over the world and share the locations of these caches on the internet. GPS users use the location coordinates to find the caches. Once found, a cache may provide a variety of rewards. Those who find a cache are asked to leave or replace items found in the cache. The National Park Service does not allow geocaching on park lands. Geocaching is inappropriate and not an approved practice at Fort Pulaski National Monument. The act of locating geocaches can lead to social trail development and resource degradation that would not otherwise occur. Additionally, geocaches can be considered abandoned property or litter and are not allowed. If anyone witnesses visitors placing or looking for geocaches in the park, please do inform them of park policy, obtain the GPS coordinates, and notify your supervisor. Fort Pulaski National Monument is currently in the process of removing all geocaches from the park.",
