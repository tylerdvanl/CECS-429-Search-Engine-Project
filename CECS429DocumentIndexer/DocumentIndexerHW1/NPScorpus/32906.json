Hard workers are needed! Adopt-A-Trail (AAT) Youth Crew is a voluntary trail adoption program available to motivated groups of high school youth from diverse local communities surrounding Olympic National Park. Families are encouraged to participate in the AAT program as well. As a group, attend an AAT training to learn the basics of trail maitenance at our park, trail etiquette, and how to use various tools. Commitment is a minimum of 3 work days a year for each AAT group. Groups will report on trail conditions to the ONP Trail Crew. This experience can also be used for a Science, English or CTE credit through the North Olympic Peninsula Skills Center Natural Resources Class. Additional commitment is necessary to use this as a Senior Culminating Project. Contact the Volunteer and Youth Office to learn more: e-mail us. This program is a natural progression of Pathways for Youth at Olympic National Park. Accomplished crew members are on the right track to move into volunteer internships and seasonal employment with the National Park Service.",
