    "body": "Mazes and Marvels - The Switzerland of America       THE BLACK HILLS The Black Hills have the most ideal scenery on the continent, thereby securing the appellation, \"The Switzerland of America.\" Geology accounts for the Black Hills by postulating a volcanic upheaval when Time was young. Extensive pine forests now cover the scene of a once terrific convulsion. All is quiet now, and the tourists, artists, and lovers of nature for nature's sake, of two hemispheres, flock hither to indulge to the utmost capacity their love of the beautiful, the romantic, the sublime. Deer have long been partial to this region and still make it the home of their choice. Trout fishing in this \"Switzerland\" is recognized as unrivaled far and near.",
