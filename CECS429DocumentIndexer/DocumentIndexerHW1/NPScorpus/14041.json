This is especially true in the Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area. The area has a long human history spanning the last ten thousand years. From the prehistoric Paleo Indians to the coal miners of recent time, Big South Fork is an area with a rich cultural tapestry. Big South Fork was even touched by events of the Civil War. Several stories emerge about people and places in this area. With the 150th Commemoration of the Civil War, the National Park Service has put together a collection of trading cards that explain events within the parks. Big South Fork has three trading cards in the collection. You can view these below.  Other parks have their cards posted at National Park Service's Civil War to Civil Rights Trading Card Program.",
