From the collection of Juanita Guinn.   Â    On the second Saturday of each month, the Obed Wild and Scenic River hosts a local park neighbor to discuss their memories of the river before it became a National Park in 1976. Their memories are at times solemn, at times humorous, and at times exciting. Each park neighbor with unique memories will enthrall our visitors with stories of what life was like on the Cumberland Plateau in years gone by.  Those interested in attending these special events are asked to be at the Obed Visitor Center by 1:00 pm (ET). The Obed Visitor Center is located at 208 North Maiden Street in downtown Wartburg. No reservations are needed for this free program.  Please contact the visitor center at 423-346-6294 to find out about our next guest speaker! Please click here to view previous speakers.",
