Rainbow Bridge was declared a National Monument in 1910 and, as such, the range of permitted activities is smaller than for the recreation area. Visitors may take the trail from the courtesy dock to the viewing area for the bridge. We ask that visitors respect the religious significance of Rainbow Bridge to neighboring tribes and consider viewing Rainbow Bridge from the viewing area rather than walking up to or under the bridge. Traditional water-based recreation activities such as swimming, fishing, water skiing, etc. are not allowed anywhere within the monument. People may backpack to Rainbow Bridge on the Navajo Mountain trail with the appropriate permit available from the Navajo Nation in Window Rock, AZ.      Hiking to Rainbow Bridge It's a two-day minimum hike around Navajo Mountain to Rainbow Bridge, and requires a permit form the Navajo Nation. Boat Tours from Glen Canyon National Recreation Area Don't have a boat of your own and don't have time for the two-day hike? Take a seven-hour boat tour across Lake Powell to see this remote and marvelous site.",
