Ever wonder what camas was? Or want to touch the type of ammunition that the army used at Big Hole. We have a touch table that has many aspects of Nez Perce and Soldier life that you are free to pick up and look at. The Glacier Conservancy has a very nice bookshop inside as well with many titles on Nez Perce, Military and Montana history. Proceeds from the sale of items come right back to the park to support park programing.",
