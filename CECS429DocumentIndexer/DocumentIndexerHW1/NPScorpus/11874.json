New technology allows park visitors to become citizen scientists and actively participate in the collection of data to document this kind of change and to see the results in the future. Ten camera stands have been strategically placed throughout the Springs Fire burn area. Help us monitor recovery by taking photographs of the view from the camera stands and posting them to your social media account with the hashtag found on the camera stand. You can also submit your images to springsfire [at] nps.gov.  Download the handout for site locations and instructions. Click on the interactive map below to help discover the camera stands, located at Rancho Sierra Vista and Point Mugu State park.",
