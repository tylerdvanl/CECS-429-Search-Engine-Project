    "body": "Treatment Techniques and Methods       The park employs a variety of preservation treatments to meet the somewhat conflicting goals of preserving these fragile resources for the long-term future while still making them available for the public to explore and study. We share these preservation and visitor use objectives with other National Parks and World Heritage sites that care for ancient architectural resources. Some of the preservation techniques that were tested in Chaco have been adapted for use in other high desert regions in Asia, Africa, South America and elsewhere. This collaboration is ongoing and helps to insure that the authenticity and integrity of significant ancient architectural monuments is preserved. Some of the preservation treatment techniques and methods tested and employed at Chaco include mortar repair, stone replacement, wall capping, backfilling or reburial, shelters, barriers and closed areas, benign neglect, records and research.
