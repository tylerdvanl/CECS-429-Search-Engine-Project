Parking is limited at all destinations, and popular trailheads like Delicate Arch and Devils Garden may fill for hours at a time, especially on weekends and holidays. View the Traffic & Travel Tips page for advice on making the most of your time (and avoiding the crowds). If you have 1.5 hours Drive to the Windows Section and see some of the park's largest arches. (Add one-half hour to stroll beneath either North Window or Double Arch.).Alternatively, drive to the Delicate Arch Viewpoint and see the world's most famous arch, a mile distant. Stop at Wolfe Ranch on your way back and imagine what it would have been like to homestead this relatively barren area in the late 1800s. If you have 3 hours Do both of the above. If you have 4.5 hours Drive all of the paved park roads, spending ten minutes at each viewpoint, and be sure to visit the Windows Section, Wolfe Ranch and the Delicate Arch Viewpoint. Four-wheel Driving There are few roads requiring four-wheel-drive in Arches. To see what's available, view the park map. Please note that off-highway vehicles (ATVs, UTVs, etc.) are prohibited in the park. Read more about park regulations.",
