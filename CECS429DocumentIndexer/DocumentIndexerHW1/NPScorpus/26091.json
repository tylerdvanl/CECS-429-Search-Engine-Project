    "body": "Pets          Pets are welcome at Wind Cave National Park within the following limits. At all times pets must be restrained on a leash no longer than six feet in length. Leashes protect dogs from becoming lost and from potential encounters with wildlife as well as protecting park wildlife and plants.   Pets should not be left unattended. Summer sunshine poses a threat to pets left in vehicles. On a sunny day, even in temperatures as low as 60° F, temperatures inside a vehicle can reach dangerous levels. On an 85-degree day the temperature inside a car –even with the windows cracked –can reach over 100 degrees within 10 minutes. Pet owners are responsible for removing pet waste from campgrounds, picnic areas, parking lots, roads, and other developed areas. Pets are not permitted in the back-country areas of the park. This includes areas near park roadways and most of the trails –see below for exceptions.   Where CAN I go with my pet?
