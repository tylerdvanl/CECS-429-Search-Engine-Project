Grassland bird study news coverage    In May and June of 2008 and 2009, staff from the Heartland Network and Prairie Cluster Prototype conducted a \"point count\" to record the kinds and numbers of birds on the prairie and in the woodlands at Homestead NM of America. Prairie bird species are on the decline and the \"point count\" helps Homestead management determine sound management practices. The count is taken at specific spots on the prairie and in the woodlands by standing in one spot for five minutes, listening and watching, and then recording the observations. Heartland Network staff will conduct the \"point count\" again in 2013 and 2014. In 2010, 2011, and 2012 volunteers will conduct \"point count\" using the exact same \"points\" and procedures.
