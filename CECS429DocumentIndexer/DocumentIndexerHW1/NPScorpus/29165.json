NPS\/Fred Mang jr.   Â    The park holds within its boundaries a vast diversity of natural resources.  These unique flora, fauna, waters, and geological formations have withstood the external pressures of man made and natural changes.  The combination of these resources has created an area unlike any in the surrounding territory. Chickasaw lies in a transition zone where the Eastern deciduous forest and the Western prairies meet.  It has flora and fauna from both environments, and other flora and fauna specific to such transition areas.  The view over Veterans Lake, especially beautiful at sunset, illustrates this transition.",
