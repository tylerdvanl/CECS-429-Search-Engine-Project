If you are simply transiting through the park, a boat permit is not necessary.    Boat permits are required for all recreational vessels including kayaks and dinghies, vessels operating under a Commercial Use Authorization and commercial fishing vessels. Vessels greater than 50 meters are required to have a Special Use Authorization in addition to the boat permit.   Download our boat permits and mooring buoys brochure.",
