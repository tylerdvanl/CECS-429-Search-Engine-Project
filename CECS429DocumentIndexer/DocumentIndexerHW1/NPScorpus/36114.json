We believe that shared experiences and an appreciation of our cultures can foster the respect that leads us to a better understanding of our neighbors. The founders of Chamizal National Memorial recognized that the visual and performing arts can be a compelling way to share cultures. Indoor Theater Visitors can attend a performance almost every weekend in the memorial's 500-seat indoor theater. Groups from the community can request a permit to present performances ranging from piano concerts to ballet folklorico to a wide variety of plays. Schedules of performances are published about a month in advance on our calendar of events. Please note, the theater will be closed for renovation during late December 2015 and January 2016. Siglo de Oro Drama Festival Each spring since 1976, Chamizal National Memorial has hosted the Siglo de Oro Drama Festival to celebrate the literature of Spain's Golden Age of art and exploration and its lasting influence on the culture of the borderlands. World-class theater companies come from Mexico, the United States, Spain, and all over Latin America to participate in the festival. Outdoor Stage From spring to fall when the weather is warm, the outdoor stage is frequently used for concerts and other performances. Bring your blanket or chairs to relax on the lawn of the bowl area around the stage. Check our calendar of events to find the next performance. These events tend to draw very large crowds. Please refer to the Superintendent's Compendium to learn the rules for these big events. Music Under the Stars Each summer, Chamizal National Memorial partners with the City of El Paso's Museums and Cultural Affairs Department to host a concert series each Sunday evening on the outdoor stage. Concerts typically begin and June and run through July or into August. Find out what you need to know about attending a Music Under the Stars concert.",
