    "body": "Park Regulations       These are a few basic regulations that apply throughout the park. Additional regulations apply for trips into the backcountry, river, or with horses & pack animals. More regulations, such as the Superintendent's Compendium, can be found on the Laws & Policies page. Walking on Arches To promote visitor safety and provide the opportunity to view natural features undisturbed, climbing, scrambling, walking on or rappelling off any named and unnamed arch with an opening greater than three feet is prohibited in the park. Superintendent's Determination [1.48MB PDF] Rock Scratches = Graffiti Even though graffiti is prohibited by law, rangers and volunteer groups spend hundreds of hours every year removing it in Canyonlands. Please join us in protecting the park by not leaving your mark. If you discover graffiti in the park, please let a ranger know. Otherwise, make memories, take pictures, but leave no visible trace of your visit. Campfires Wood fires are allowed in the developed campgrounds (e.g. Squaw Flat) and along the rivers. They are prohibited elsewhere in the backcountry. Wood may not be gathered in the park except along the river corridors where driftwood and dead-and-down tamarisk may be burned. River trips must use a fire pan and remove all fire debris from the backcountry. Cultural Resources Disturbing, entering or camping within 300 feet of an archeological or historical site is prohibited. Collecting artifacts is prohibited. Hunting & Fishing Hunting is prohibited in Canyonlands. The discharging of firearms is prohibited. Fishing is allowed. Visitors who fish in the park must have a valid Utah State Fishing License and must comply with Utah State Fishing Regulations. Natural Resources Disturbing or collecting natural features (plants, rocks, etc.) is prohibited. Off-road Vehicles ATVs, OHVs, and UTVs are not permitted in the park. Motor bikes must be interstate-legal. All vehicles must remain on designated roads and be operated by a licensed driver.  Permits Permits are required for all overnight trips in the backcountry. Permits are also required for day use on the White Rim, Elephant Hill, Lavender Canyon, and Salt Creek \/ Horse Canyon roads. Personal Water Craft Personal water craft (e.g. Jet Skis) are not permitted on the rivers in Canyonlands. Pets Activities with pets are very limited in the park. Pets may accompany visitors in the developed campgrounds and on paved scenic drives, but must be leashed at all times when outside a vehicle. Pets are not allowed on any hiking trails, at overlooks, or in the backcountry, even on a boat or in a vehicle. Portable Toilets Canyonlands requires all river runners to carry out their solid human waste. This is also required of visitors camping in the Maze District campsites and at the New Bates Wilson, Peekaboo, Chesler Park and Elephant Canyon campsites in the Needles. The park requires the use of washable, reusable toilet systems or the type of system that uses dry chemicals and enzymes to render solid human waste into nonhazardous products acceptable for disposal in permitted landfills. Toilet systems must be designed to contain human waste in such a fashion as to provide for secure containment and adequate storage. Unmanned Aircraft (Drones) The use of unmanned aircraft is prohibited to protect public safety, minimize visitor-use conflicts, and prevent unacceptable impacts to scenic values, natural soundscapes, and wildlife.
