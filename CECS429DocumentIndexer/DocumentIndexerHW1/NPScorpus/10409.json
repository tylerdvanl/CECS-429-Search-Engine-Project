    "body": "Suggested Stories and Storylines          Commerce on the River Culture and History   Wildlife Management Park Education Programming        Commerce on the River    Ethanol and the Mississippi River Touted as an alternative to foreign oil, ethanol production has driven up corn prices in the Midwest, but it is eating up vast amounts of water. Ethanol can't replace oil entirely, but increased corn production right now is changing the face of shipping on the river and may soon change the flow of the river itself. Contact: John Anfinson (Chief of Resource Management) 651-293-8432.    Commerce at the Head of Navigation  The Twin Cities are the head of navigation on the Mississippi River. Commodities shipped from here can travel to the Gulf of Mexico and the world. As gas prices soar and ethanol plants proliferate, more corn is staying at home. How has the Mississippi River been important to the Midwest's economy in the past and how might its role be changing? Contact: John Anfinson (Chief of Resource Management) 651-293-8432.

There were 22 active bald eagle nests along the Mississippi River through the heart of the Twin Cities in 2008, up from 14 just two years ago. Young eagles have high levels of contaminants in their blood, but despite continuing threats, the nation's symbol is staging a huge comeback both in the Twin Cities area and throughout its range.

Native Mussels: Signs of a Healthier River Native mussels are a biological measure of water quality and high water quality contributes to Twin Cities residents' quality of life. Founded on the Mississippi River, the Twin Cities first used the river for transportation and power. Unfortunately, those communities turned their collective backs to the river and it became a place to dump sewage and industrial refuse. Once a foul-smelling source of disease, the river today is much cleaner, and the mussels are returning. And many communities along the river now use the river for drinking water and recreation. Once nearly driven to extinction by pollution, the river's mussels are returning in the heart of the Twin Cities, where water quality has improved and exotic species are being kept at bay. The river, however, still faces challenges. Contact: John Anfinson (Chief of Resource Management) 651-293-8432.    Zebra Mussels: Invasive Species Threaten Our Quality of Life  A small freshwater mussel from Asia has invaded the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River, threatening native mussels and fouling beaches with sharp, toe-slicing shells. These prolific, invasive mussels pose grave threats to recreation, biological, and industrial resources.  Contact: John Anfinson (Chief of Resource Management) 651-293-8432.     Culture and History    Dakota Center of the Earth  To the Mdewakanton Dakota, the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers, in the heart of the Twin Cities, has deep historic and spiritual meaning. It is the site of creation and tragic losses.  Contacts: John Anfinson (Park Historian) 651-293-8432.  More information:  Prairie Island Indian Community Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community Lower Sioux Indian Community Upper Sioux Community    St. Paul Municipal Elevator and Sackhouse St. Paul began its life as a port city.
