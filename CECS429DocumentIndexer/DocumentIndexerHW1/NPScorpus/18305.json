National Gateways and Trails to the Chesapeake Throughout the Chesapeake, there are places with stories so significant to the United States that Congress links them together and officially recognizes them: Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail: how the national anthem came to be written. That story was born out of the War of 1812 -- a time when the world's most powerful Navy, belonging to the British, dominated the Chesapeake, trapped citizens in their homes, and offered an interesting alternative to enslaved people who could escape. Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail: how the Chesapeake Bay was before Europeans permanently settled here. There are still places today that look like they did 400 years ago. And the Indians who were here then, are still here now. Use these trail sites to experience the old Bay. Gateways and Watertrails Network: all the different ways to experience the Chesapeake. Each of the 172 places in the Network have a unique take on a Chesapeake Bay story -- colonial downtowns, watermen stories, lighthouses, boats, wildlife preserves, and parks to play in. Play on the Water Chesapeake Bay is all about the water. And there are ways to get out there and experience the thrill and the relaxation of seeing the world from on a boat.  Be a Waterman for a Day As the Chesapeake Conservancy puts it, \"Watermen are intertwined with the unique identity of the Chesapeake Bay, influencing its history, culture, and economy. Watermen Heritage Tours offer a rare glimpse into their way of life. More than entertaining, these authentic experiences are helping to preserve a culture and continue a Chesapeake Bay tradition.\" Hook up with Watermen Heritage Tours to tong for oysters, or go crabbing and take home the catch.
