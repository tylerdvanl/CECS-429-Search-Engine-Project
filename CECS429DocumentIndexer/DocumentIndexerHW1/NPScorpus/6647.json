    "body": "Canoeing,  Kayaking, and  Tubing         The Niobrara NSR gives visitors a chance to kick back and relax. NPS Photo\/Ryan Schmieder  Most visitors come to the Niobrara to float the river by canoe, tube, kayak, or raft. Many camp overnight in various private campgrounds operated by individual outfitters, or at the campground in Smith Falls State Park.   While floating the Niobrara is a popular summer activity, spring and fall are also great times to enjoy the river by canoe or kayak. 80% of visitors come on Saturdays, 10% on Sundays, and 10% the rest of the week. If you are looking for a social experience, Saturday is the ideal time. If you are looking for a quieter, more family-friendly trip, consider Sundays or a weekday float.
