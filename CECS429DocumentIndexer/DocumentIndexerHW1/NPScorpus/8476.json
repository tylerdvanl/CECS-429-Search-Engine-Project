    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Directions & Transportation     Getting Around               Getting Around              Most people arrive at the seashore through one of the passenger ferry services.  They then walk to where they wish to go.  Near the lighthouse a boardwalk makes the journey from the ferry dock to the beach a little easier.         A 4-wheel drive vehicle makes searching for that good shelling, surf-fishing or camping spot a little easier. If you don't have your own check with the ferry services for details on the beach shuttles. Don't forget to get a parking permit if you will be leaving your vehicle unattended for 24 hours or more. Information and the permit application can be found on the Permits page.        Jeff Lovett, NC Outward Bound  Boats are another way to explore the islands and the surrounding waters.",
