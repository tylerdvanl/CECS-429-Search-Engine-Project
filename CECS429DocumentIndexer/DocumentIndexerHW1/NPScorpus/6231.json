    "body": "Comprehensive Guide to Collections       The Comprehensive Guide to Collections (1664-1990) is a combined index to nearly 100 manuscript collections related to the Ridgely family and life at Hampton. Some collections are entirely related to Hampton and the Ridgelys; other collections have only a few relevant items.        Finding aids from all identified collections were analyzed and descriptions entered into a Microsoft Access database. The database records were then organized by creator of the document and by type of material (e.g. financial records, correspondence, journals, etc.), and sorted by date. The level of descriptive detail depends on the original processing method. For some collections, each item was listed; others were described more generally. For more information on how the database was created, contact Archivist Julia Lehnert by phone at 410-823-1309 or by e-mail.           Two Methods of Viewing the Guide        1) Click here to download the entire Guide: PDF 390 KB.       2) Use the Some Notable Ridgelys page as a Table of Contents. It provides biographical information on each individual included in the Comprehensive Guide and links to sections of the guide pertaining to that person.       For additional background information, consult the Biographical Sketch of the Ridgely Family Papers Finding Aid, Hampton MS 001, available on the Hampton Archival Collections page.     The guide is organized primarily by document creator but reports are also available on several topics: Ridgely Family History & Genealogy, Accounts & Ledgers (1732-1946), Northampton Furnace (the Ridgelys' Baltimore County enterprise), Enslaved and Free Workers and Society for the Preservation of Maryland Antiquities.
