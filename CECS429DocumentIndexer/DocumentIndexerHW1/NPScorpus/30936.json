Today about 660 miles of the 1,200-mile Ice Age Trail have been built.  To complete the trail, detailed public planning processes are being carried out in counties where significant gaps remain. Planning efforts are currently underway in Marquette, Rock, and Chippewa Counties. To review and comment on these efforts, click on the following links: Marquette County Rock County Chippewa County The NPS is also working to include the Ice Age Complex in Cross Plains in a Nationwide Multi-Unit Fire Management Plan and Environmental Assessment. This document is also available for review.   The following completed plans are available on-line. Langlade County (2014) Marathon County (2014) Ice Age Complex at Cross Plains (2012) Lake Michigan (2006) Waushara County (2007) Waupaca and Portage Counties (1997)  In 2013 a Long Range Interpretive Plan (LRIP) was developed for a portion of the Ice Age National Scenic Trail. The LRIP covers parts of Dane, Columbia, and Sauk counties, from the Ice Age Complex at Cross Plains to the Aldo Leopold Shack in Sauk County, In 2001, a Handbook for Trail Design, Construction and Maintenance was developed which includes more detailed guidance and a broad range of technical information regarding the methods and standards used to construct the trail.",
