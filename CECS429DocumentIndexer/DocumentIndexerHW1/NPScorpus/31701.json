Public support is a critical component in the management of National Park Service lands. No other federal agency relies as heavily on the generosity and kindness of its visitors, and we thank you for your past support and look forward to future partnerships.   If you are looking for ways to help support Bluestone National Scenic River, New River Gorge National River, and Gauley River National Recreation Area, in our efforts to preserve and protect their spectacular natural and cultural features, you are welcome to make a contribution of cash or checks to the donation boxes located near the front doors of the Canyon Rim or Sandstone Visitor Centers. You may also mail a check to park headquarters at: New River Gorge National River, 104 Main Street, P. O. Box 246, Glen Jean, WV 25846. Checks are to be made out to the National Park Service. Your contributions will aid the park interpretive and education programs, help maintain park facilities, exhibits, and grounds, and assist in efforts to restore, preserve, and protect New River Gorge National River. Only donations over $100.00 can be assigned to a specific account or project. The National Park Service (NPS) may accept donations from individuals, families, organizations, foundations, corporations, businesses, associations and other entities. All monetary donations received directly by the NPS are deposited in a donation account and accounted for and disbursed using the same standards and procedures for appropriated (federal) funds.",
