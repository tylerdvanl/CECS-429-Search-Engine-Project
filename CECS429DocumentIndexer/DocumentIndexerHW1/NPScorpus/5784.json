Â   Hiking within Big Cypress can be along designated trails, or orienteering through unmarked territory. Hikers should be prepared for conditions depending on the season. The dry season provides the most comfortable hiking conditions. The wet season has its unique challenges, and hikers should be prepared for tromping through water that in places can be waist deep. During either season rewards can be many - quietly watching an otter eat a fish, feeling the wind rustling your hair, discovering tropical blooms or happening upon a bear track. Each party entering the backcountry should fill out a backcountry permit. During hunting seasons it is recomended that all people going in to the backcountry of the Preserve wear a lightweight, blaze orange vest. You may purchase these at any local sporting goods store.
