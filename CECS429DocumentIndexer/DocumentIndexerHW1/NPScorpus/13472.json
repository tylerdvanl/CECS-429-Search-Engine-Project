    "body": "Comprehensive Management Plan       The National Trails System Act directs the National Park Service to prepare a plan for new national trails that describes how the trails will develop and be maintained. The purpose of the plan is to identify trail priorities through a consensus-driven planning process that involves trail partners and stakeholders. The plan describes how and where NPS and its partners will prioritize resource protection, provide education and interpretation, and improve the visitor experience in the future. In June 2012 NPS, in coordination with Maryland Office of Tourism Development and Maryland State Highway Administration, completed a management plan for the trail and the companion Star-Spangled Banner Byway in Maryland.
