NPS\/Taormina  Adopt-A-Cannon Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie are home to the rarest collection of American seacoast artillery in existence. Cannons manufactured as early as 1830 desperately need restoration after decades in harsh outdoor environments at both forts. The Fort Sumter - Fort Moultrie Historical Trust has created Adopt-A-Cannon to help fund high-priority conservation by the Warren Lasch Conservation Center, renowned for ground-breaking work with the H.L. Hunley submarine. Imagine putting your hands on historic cannons knowing you helped preserve these rare and priceless \"witnesses\" to American history. Individuals, groups, and organizations who contribute to preservation of these relics will be invited to observe the conservation process on-site at Fort Moultrie or Fort Sumter.
