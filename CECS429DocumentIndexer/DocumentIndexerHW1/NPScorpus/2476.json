NPS\/Robb Hannawacker         The Grand Canyon is home to 41 species of reptiles that live in every part of the park- from the pine forests of the rim to the Colorado River. The 22 snake, 18 lizard, and 1 tortoise species that live here are important and beautiful species that range from commonly seen collared lizards to the elusive desert tortoise. Reptiles have many important roles in the Grand Canyon. Many are prey for raptors and mammals, while lizards prey on insect populations, and snake species control rodent populations- preventing the spread of diseases like Bubonic Plague and Hantavirus. Many of the reptile species found inside the park are unique- the Grand Canyon rattlesnake (Crotalus organus abysus) is found nowhere else in the world.      Please only view reptiles from a distance- Grand Canyon is home to 7 highly venomous reptiles: 6 species of Rattlesnake and the Gila Monster- the only venomous lizard in the United States. Small lizards and snakes can be easily harmed if they are handled.          Gila monsters are identified by their beaded skin and vivid coloration.   Gila Monster  Gila monsters are found in the desert areas at the far western edge of Grand Canyon National Park.           Gopher snakes are the longest snakes in Arizona, and are often mistaken for rattlesnakes.   Gopher Snake  At Grand Canyon, gopher snakes live in both the wooded forests of the Rims and the dry desert scrub inside the Canyon.          These small lizards primarily prey on ants within the park.   Greater (Mountain) Short-horned Lizard   At Grand Canyon, short-horned lizards are found on the Rims and inside the Canyon. Their camouflage makes them very difficult to see.          Rattlesnakes are usually seen coiled on or under rocks.   Rattlesnakes  The Grand Canyon is home to six species of rattlesnakes. Please observe these venomous predators from a distance.             These moderately-sized lizards are some of the most commonly seen animals in Grand Canyon National Park.   Yellow-backed Spiny Lizard   Yellow-backed spiny lizards are found throughout Grand Canyon National Park, but are most commonly seen inside the Canyon.      Quick Facts:  41 reptile species live in the park- 18 lizards, 22 snakes, and 1 species of tortoise. While the 6 rattlesnake species in the park are the most venomous creatures in the park, several other snake species are mildly venomous, including the Sonoran lyre snake and desert nightsnake.  The Gila Monster, found in the western part of the Park, is one of only 2 venomous lizards in North America.       More information: https:\/\/azgfdportal.az.gov\/Wildlife\/NonGameManagement\/reptiles Reptiles of Grand Canyon NP (52.5kb PDF File) Grand Canyon Vertebrate Animal Species List (223kb PDF File)  Grand Canyon Threatened & Endangered Species List (52kb PDF File)",
