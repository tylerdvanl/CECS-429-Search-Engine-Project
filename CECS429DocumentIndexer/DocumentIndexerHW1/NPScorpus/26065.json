Ranger-led cave tours, Discovery talks on the front lawn, and campfire programs in the campground are just a few of the kid-friendly programs available. The Touch Table at the visitor center has hides, horns, and other interesting objects to touch and feel.        NPS  Programs Cave Tours Which tour is best for your family? Generally speaking, kids 3 and under will likely need to be carried some or all of the way for all tours. (Note: Backpack carriers are not allowed in the cave.)  The pace and distance of the Natural Entrance Tour works well even for young children. Most older kids (6 and up) have no problem with the Fairgrounds Tour, the most strenuous of the three regular walking tours. Ask a ranger for more information. Do age restrictions apply? The minimum age for the Candlelight Tour is 8 years old. Minimum age for the Wild Cave Tour is 16 years old and requires signed parental permission. There are no age restrictions for the Garden of Eden, Natural Entrance, or Fairgrounds tours. Adventures in Nature This free program geared for children ages 3-12 is offered select Tuesdays January into April.
