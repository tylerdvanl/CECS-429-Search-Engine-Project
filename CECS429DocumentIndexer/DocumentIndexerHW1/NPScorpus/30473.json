    "body": "Picnicking in the Park       Whether you need an area large enough for a family reunion or an intimate spot for two, you'll enjoy picnicking in the park. Picnic areas are scattered throughout Cuyahoga Valley National Park (CVNP); some provide grills, and all have tables. Alcohol is prohibited in CVNP. All picnic areas are first-come, first-served, with the exception of the Ledges and Octagon Shelters. Both can be reserved for a fee. There are also many picnic areas within the greater boundary of CVNP that are managed by Summit Metro Parks and Cleveland Metroparks. The following chart indicates the size and type of the picnic facilities managed and maintained by the National Park Service.
