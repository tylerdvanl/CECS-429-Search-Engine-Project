J. Hubble  Two Districts, One Park Where do we begin? There is so much to take in while visiting this beautiful park. Saguaro National Park is home to one of the world's most majestic plants - the Saguaro Cactus (scientific name Carnegiea gigantea). This Sonoran Desert native, is a large, tree-sized cactus with a relatively long lifespan - up to 250 years. Its beautiful white, waxy flower (which blooms late May-July) is the Arizona state flower and is a favorite treat for the diverse animal populations that call Saguaro National Park home. Saguaro National Park has two districts - East & West - that are separated by the City of Tucson. It takes 30-45 minutes to transit between the two districts depending on route and traffic, so it is important you plan accordingly. Don't worry, you only pay the entrance fee once, and your pass is good at both locations for 7 days from the date of purchase. Each district has a variety of ranger led, guided programs you can choose from. Programs are similar from week to week, and are subject to change without notice. Some interpretive programs are accessible to persons with physical disabilities or require a reservation to participate. This information will be noted on the schedule along with a phone number to make a reservation or get more information.",
