The park is a great setting to enhance your lessons on life sciences, earth sciences, or history\/social studies. Organizing a field trip after studying a particular unit is very beneficial. Reinforce classroom lessons through experiential learning at the park! Browse the park's curriculum materials, or search the entire National Park Service for lesson plans and teacher resources. You can also download our Teacher's Guide to learn more about the park and get ideas on what to do with your students.
