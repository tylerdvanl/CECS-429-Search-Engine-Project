NPS\/Brad Sutton      Where Can I Take My Pet?Activities with pets are very limited in Joshua Tree National Park. Pets are not allowed in buildings, on hiking trails, or anywhere in the backcountry. There is only one exception: you may take leashed pets on the paved Oasis of Mara Trail near the visitor center in Twentynine Palms.If you're looking for other nice places to walk your dog, we recommend the park's unpaved roads. These generally have very little traffic and allow you to hike in the company of your dog. Backcountry roads feature spectacular scenery and the chance to get off the beaten path.Picnic areas and developed campgrounds also offer opportunities to experience the park's diverse scenery with your pet. Remember to Leave No Trace by picking up after your pet.Pets must be leashed at all times when outside a vehicle. Pets may accompany visitors in picnic areas, developed campgrounds, and \"anywhere your car can go\"—in parking lots and along roads. Pets should never be taken more than 100 feet (about 30 m) from a road, picnic area, or campground. Pets may never be left unattended.Pet Health and SafetyThe desert can be deadly for pets. Car temperatures rise quickly in the sun, even on cool days. Your pet could die of heat exhaustion. If you must leave a pet in a car, crack the windows as much as possible and leave water to drink. We recommend not leaving pets in the car at all when temperatures are above about 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees C), even with the windows cracked.Abundant cactus spines and the chance of a run-in with a rattlesnake or scorpion are good reasons not to let your pet roam free. Wild predators such as coyotes and mountain lions could prey on your pet, even during daylight hours. Keep your animal close by your side using a leash no longer than 6 feet (1.8 m) in length.Boarding Your PetIf you wish to hike on park trails where your dog cannot go, we urge you to look into the boarding services that may be available in gateway communities. Boarding your pet will allow you to explore the park more freely. Please contact area chambers of commerce for more information:Twentynine Palms Chamber of Commerce: 760-367-3445Joshua Tree Chamber of Commerce: 760-366-3723Yucca Valley Chamber of Commerce: 760-365-6323Palm Springs Chamber of Commerce: 760-325-1577Desert Hot Springs Chamber of Commerce: 760-329-6403Indio Chamber of Commerce: 760-347-0676 Why All the Restrictions?For many people, seeing wildlife is a highlight of a national park visit. Unfortunately, the very presence of pets in the park alters the natural behavior of native wildlife. Remember, our pet dogs are descended from wolves, and still show predatory behaviors.The scents left behind by dogs may turn wildlife away from important habitats such as fan palm oases.Sensitive archeological sites are often difficult to see and may inadvertently be disturbed by inquisitive four-legged visitors.Even though your pet may obey commands and be well behaved, other visitors do not know your pet. They may feel uncomfortable in the presence of an unleashed animal.By following the park's simple regulations and respecting fellow visitors, you and your pet can have a happy and healthy park outing.",
