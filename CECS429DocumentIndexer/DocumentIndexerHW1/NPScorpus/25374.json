This is the number one message preserve visitors must know and apply to their visit to Gates of the Arctic. There is no cell phone service and there are no amenities, services, or other infrastructure in the preserve. When you depart Fairbanks, Bettles, or Anaktuvuk pass you may not see another person until your return to civilization or your pilot comes to pick you up. Visitors must be self-reliant and able to execute self-extraction and communication, should an emergency situation arise.  Communication Cell phones do not work in the wilderness of the Central Brooks Range. Satellite phones provide far better coverage in Alaska's wilderness areas and it may be wise to consider renting a satellite phone in Fairbanks before your trip to the park. Bear Safety  Read about staying safe in bear country to learn safe and responsible practices for recreating on Alaska's wild lands.
