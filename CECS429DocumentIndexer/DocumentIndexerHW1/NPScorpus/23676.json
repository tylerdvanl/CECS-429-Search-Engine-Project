Artists are selected by a jury of professionals from diverse artistic disciplines based solely on the quality of that year’s applicants’ presentations from all disciplines. However, in any given year, the park may choose to stipulate (or limit) the disciplines from which it accepts applications, based on compatibility with current programming objectives and needs. Selected artists stay in an historic, pueblo style furnished residential facility for up to one month during the period from mid-September through December 19. No application fee is required and no stipend is provided. The Artist in Residence Program benefits the Artist andthe Park. The primary purpose of the program is to give qualified artist\/applicants an opportunity to live and practice their chosen discipline, following their own inspirations, in a National Park. In return for the opportunity, the artists agree to interact with the public and share a mutually agreed upon portion of the work they create with the Park for interpretive and educational purposes. Artwork Donated to the Park Participating artists are asked to donate to the park an original piece of artwork from and, representative of their residency in Bandelier National Monument. Donated artwork must be received no later than one year after the artist’s residency. Artwork from visual artists should be framed and prepared for hanging before donation, following generally accepted standards for museum display (UV protective glazing is preferred).    Artists are required to provide the copyright for this artwork to the National Park Service. The National Park Service will not allow the commercial use of any donated artwork once it is accepted by the Park. Artwork may be used in exhibits and for educational purposes by Bandelier National Monument’s non-profit cooperation association for their products. 1. The artist retains royalty-free non-exclusive use license under the copyright of the art. 2. The National Park Service owns the artwork and the rights to reproduce it. Under those rights, the artist has a license to make use of the artwork for his or her purposes. When artists reproduce artwork for their own purposes, publication will include the language: “This artwork was produced under the Artist-in-Residence Program at Bandelier National Monument.” These creative works will be exhibited as frequently as possible and shared with the public through other appropriate means. Artwork not on display will be properly stored and protected from damage by environmental elements.  Public Presentations Artists will present two public programs during their residency. These may be tailored to an individual’s medium, interest and experience, and can be a demonstration, talk, guided hike or performance. Artists will provide their own supplies and equipment for these presentations, excepting sound and projection devices already present in park facilities. Program Management Bandelier National Monument’s Artist-in-Residence Program is managed by the park’s Division of Interpretation. The finished works completed under this program are expected to characterizeBandelier National Monument for present and future generations, and offer the park visitor and the general public an opportunity to appreciate our heritage through the expressions of the contributing artists. How to Apply Artists must submit application materials and samples exactly as indicated on the application form. Insufficient or excessive application materials including samples will be cause for rejection of the application, as is an artist’s proposed use of a work already in progress as a residency project. 2016 Applications Calendar Bandelier National Monument will accept applications for artist-in-residence positions lasting for a maximum of four weeks each. These will be scheduled between May and Mid- December, 2016. Applications must be postmarked no later than March 5, 2016. Applications postmarked after the deadline will not be considered.

Skabelund was born in central Utah, received his BFA degree at Utah State University in Logan, attended graduate school at the University of Iowa, and taught drawing and installation art at Northern Arizona University. In 1998 he settled in Flagstaff, Arizona. Today he is well established in his field, working in drawing, painting, sculpture, and installations. His works have been displayed in more than 30 one-person shows all across the country, including one at Grand Canyon National Park. In addition, he has curated shows of others' works, including this year's \"Fires of Change\" at the Coconino Center for the Arts in Flagstaff. Many of his works can be seen on his website, shawnskabelund.com   While at Bandelier, Skabelund plans to concentrate on drawing. Wildfires have been an influence on him throughout his life, and he was especially attracted to the large piles of debris left in Frijoles Canyon by the floods resulting from the Las Conchas Fire. He wanted to have time to do pencil drawings capturing their size and the combinations of natural materials brought together by the force of the water. He also plans to work with other natural images as well.       Photo by David Halpern",
