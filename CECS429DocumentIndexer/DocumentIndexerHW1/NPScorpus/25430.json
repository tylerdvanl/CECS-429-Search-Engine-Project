Explore Bartlett Cove Bartlett Cove is the only developed area in Glacier Bay National Park. Glacier Bay Lodge, the Park Visitor Center, Visitor Information Station, exhibits, Park Headquarters, several trails, a public dock, kayak rentals, and walk-in campground provide a variety of services surrounded by the Alaskan wilderness. Park Rangers provide regular guided activities, and also board cruise ships and tour vessels to present information about Glacier Bay and answer questions. Learn more about what to do in and near Gustavus, and Bartlett Cove.         Glacier Bay By Boat As its name implies, Glacier Bay National Park is largely water. Whether on a cruise ship with thousands of other passengers or in a single kayak, most visitors experience Glacier Bay from a boat. Learn more about cruise ships, tour vessels, charter boats, and bringing your own boat to Glacier Bay.      Wilderness Adventures Glacier Bay is above all a wilderness park and saves its greatest rewards for those who are willing to sweat a bit and sleep on the ground. Learn more about camping, hiking, backpacking, kayaking, rafting, and mountaineering.         Glacier Bay National Preserve Glacier Bay National Preserve, northwest of the park, is managed differently than the park. Hunting, trapping, and commercial fishing are allowed here.
