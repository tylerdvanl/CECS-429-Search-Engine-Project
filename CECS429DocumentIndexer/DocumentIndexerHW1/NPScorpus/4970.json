There is no right or guarantee of renewal. Permittee must reapply for a new CUA for succeeding periods upon expiration of the current CUA.  CUAs are issued for a fee. The current fee is $250.

These services need not be \"necessary\" but are \"appropriate\" services that may enhance the visitor experience, and have been determined to have minimal impact on resources and park values.  Commercial business activity is prohibited within the park unless a CUA has been granted by the park (36 CFR Sec. 5.3).
