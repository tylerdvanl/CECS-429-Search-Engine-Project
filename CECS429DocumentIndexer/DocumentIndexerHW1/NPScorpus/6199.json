We ask that dog owners be respectful of the park and remove dog waste. Bags for that purpose are located in a dispenser near the kiosk in the main parking lot Except for official guide dogs for the disabled, pets are not permitted in any of the park buildings. While much of the main parking lot remains shaded throughout the day, the inside of the vehicle may still become very hot. Please take care when leaving your pet in the car for lengthy periods. Water is available in the main parking lot.",
