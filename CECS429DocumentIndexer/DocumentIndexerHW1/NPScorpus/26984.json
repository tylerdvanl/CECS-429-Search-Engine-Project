    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Pets              Pets      Please be aware that having a pet with you will limit your activities in Great Basin National Park.  Kennel services are not available in or around the park. Be aware of the following regulations before deciding to bring your pet:  Pets must be kept on a leash 6 feet in length or shorter at all times. This is for the protection of the pet, wildlife, and other visitors. Pets are not permitted in Lehman Caves or at evening programs. Pets are not permitted on trails or in the backcountry of the park, except leashed pets on the Lexington Arch Trail and the Great Basin Visitor Center to Baker Trail. (Please note: the unimproved dirt road to Lexington Arch is rough and rutted, requiring a high clearance 4-wheel drive vehicle and advanced driving skills to reach the trailhead. Route finding is necessary at parts of the trail due to flood damage.) Leashed pets can only be exercised in the campgrounds, in front of the visitor centers, and along roads. Pet owners are required to immediately remove and properly dispose of fecal matter deposited by their pets. Deposit bags of fecal matter in a dumpster. Pets may not be left unattended at campsites or tied to trees or other fixtures.  Why are there restrictions on pets in National Parks?A national park is a refuge for native wildlife.  Restrictions are intended to prevent stress and molestation of wildilfe, to protect pets from wildlife that may attack or harm them, and to provide an enjoyable experience for those visitors without pets.  Domestic animals can also spread diseases to other wildlife through feces and other bodily fluids.",
