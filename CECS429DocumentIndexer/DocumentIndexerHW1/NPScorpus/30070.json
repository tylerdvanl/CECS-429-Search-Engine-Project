Winter offers visitors the opportunity to experience a side of the Seashore most summer beachgoers miss. Nature lovers enjoy birding and botanizing behind the dunes this time of year without pesky ticks and mosquitoes. Many waterfowl come just for the winter months, dabbling and diving in the Great South Bay, while Snowy Owls can be seen searching tall grasses for their small mammal prey. Powerful winter storm waves leave behind tiny treasures on the beach, like shells and sea glass, drawing beach combers from near and far. And, when the snow is sufficient, some folks will even cross-country ski by the sea! Hardy hikers delight in the three-mile round-trip hike to the breach, an opening in the barrier island created by Hurricane Sandy. This ranger-guided walk through undulating back dune habitat and across the windswept beach explores New York's only federally designated wilderness.
