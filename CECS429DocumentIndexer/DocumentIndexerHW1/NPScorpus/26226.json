Through this process, they identified several important stories and connections to help you better understand the site and its many layers of history. This three-part online exhibit, Beyond Officers Row: Duty & Daily Life at the U.S. Army's Fort Vancouver, is the result of their work. It includes articles and images interpreting topics selected by the students to complement the park's existing interpretive media and broaden the opportunity for you to connect your interests to the park's resources and stories.
