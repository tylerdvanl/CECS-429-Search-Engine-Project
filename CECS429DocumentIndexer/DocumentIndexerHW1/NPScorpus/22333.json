The Square Tower Group Trail is fun for all ages. Be sure to pick up a trail guide at the visitor center and plan on spending at least 1.5 hours hiking the loop.   Kids also enjoy interpretive talks where they might learn how to grind corn on a Matate',  how to use an atlatl, or how lizards survive at Hovenweep. Programs and times vary. Call or check at the visitor center for current listings. Large groups may schedule special interpretive activities by contacting the park at least two weeks in advance.  Junior Ranger Program  Along with family-oriented interpretive talks, Hovenweep has a Junior Ranger Program suitable for ages 6 to 12. The program introduces children to the cultural history of the area and their role in preserving special places like Hovenweep. The free booklet includes several fun activities that kids can complete while they explore the Square Tower Group. Booklets are available at the visitor center or you can download the Junior Ranger booklet here. Hovenweep also has a free activity sheet for children 5 and under. Hovenweep's Junior Ranger Program is a proud partner with the Let's Move Outside Initiative.",
