    "body": "Site Survey Data        Site maps, completed in 2006 NPS Photo        Baseline site survey data is collected at all sites and serves as the backbone of documentation necessary for every archeological site at Mesa Verde National Park. Over 4,700 sites in the park have received this level of documentation since the first survey projects were conducted in the 1930s. Currently, sketch maps, photographs, and a GPS location are part of this documentation package. Our goal is to update the site survey information on all sites documented prior to 1996 when our current methodology was established.          Documenting a rubble mound that represents a pueblo, 2001 NPS Photo        Artifacts are photographed and identified in the field. Artifacts can help determine the function of a site during the time period it was occupied.",
