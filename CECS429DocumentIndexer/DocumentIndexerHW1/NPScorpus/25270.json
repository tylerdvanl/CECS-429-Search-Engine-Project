All ribbon seals have four rings, or ribbons, of white to light brown fur on their bodies. An unusual organ, an air sac, is found near their trachea. Its function is unknown, but is thought to help ribbon seals when they dive to depths of 1950 feet (590 m)! Even how this seal moves across ice is unique. They alternate their front flippers to move forward, rather than wiggle their bodies like other seal species.",
