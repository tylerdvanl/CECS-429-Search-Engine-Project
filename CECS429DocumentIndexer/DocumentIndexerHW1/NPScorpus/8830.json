On October 15, 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed legislation to create Pictured Rocks as America's first National Lakeshore.  Anniversary events included public programs and several new efforts to further the lakeshore's positive relationship with gateway communities and local citizens.  This celebration helped remind us of how fortunate we are to have a national park area in our own back yard!
