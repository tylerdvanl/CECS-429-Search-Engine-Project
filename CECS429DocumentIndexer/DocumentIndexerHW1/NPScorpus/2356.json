Historically limited to more southerly areas in Arizona, climate change has allowed for this species to move north to the South Rim. While these animals are often confused for feral pigs, they are actually only very distant relatives.      Identification:  To tell the difference between collared peccaries and other Grand Canyon mammals, look for these characteristics:  Adults average between 2.5-3 ft (0.8-1 m) in length. Generally weigh between 33-55 lbs (15-25 kg). Light- to dark-gray coloration with a white \"collar\" following from their mid-back around their necks. Collared peccaries are rarely seen alone and often travel in groups of three or more.         Quick Facts about Collared Peccaries:   Collared peccaries are often called javelinas, the Spanish name for the species. Grand Canyon National Park is not part of the collared peccary's historic range.  Collared peccaries differ from pigs or boars in many ways, including lacking tusks. The collared peccary is the only one of three peccary species to live in North America, all of which live in South America.",
