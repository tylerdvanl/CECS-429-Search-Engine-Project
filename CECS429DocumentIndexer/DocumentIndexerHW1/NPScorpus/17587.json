Conserving water and retaining rainwater not only saves a precious resource, but also reduces the energy used for treatment and transport. Golden Gate National Recreation Area uses several methods to conserve water.   Facilities throughout the park have low-flow faucets and dual-flush toilets to decrease water usage. Laundry facilities at Cavallo Point Lodge use a state of the art water reclamation system that reduces water use by 65 percent. Land's End Lookout retains and treats storm water on site, reducing the impact of storm water runoff on municipal systems. At the Crissy Field Center, over 50 percent of water used to flush toilets is supplied by a 5,000 gallon rain catchment system. Alcatraz also uses a rainwater catchment system to water landscaping on the island.      Water also can be conserved by choosing drought tolerant plants and efficient irrigation systems. Examples in the park include drought tolerant grass planted at Fort Baker to reduce watering during summer months, and an efficient irrigation system at the Great Meadow in Fort Mason that saves 20 percent of the annual water use. The Native Plant Nurseries managed by the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy also use water-efficient techniques for propagation.
