NPS  Field trips begin in the Summit Level Visitor Center where students will watch the park film and explore the visitor center. Next, students will learn \"how to build a railroad\" by watching a demonstration of log hewing, stone cutting or rope making. The actual demonstration provided will depend on the weather and staffing. From there, students will move into the Engine House and learn about the inclined planes, steam engines and pulley systems that hauled rail cars over the Allegheny Mountains. Model steam engines will be used to demonstrate how the full size steam engines in the Engine House worked. The tour will end at the Lemon House where students will learn about travelers on the Allegheny Portage Railroad. Programs are $1 per student and adults and chaperones are free. Teachers should plan about 2 hours total for the program. The field trip is entirely wheelchair accessible. Portions of the program are outside, so students and teachers are reminded to dress appropriately. There is a picnic area, located off old route 22, available to school groups. Please contact Acting Chief of Interpretation Doug Bosley at 814-886-6162 or e-mail us for more information or to schedule a field trip.  Â    Fee Waivers Educational groups coming to the park for a school visit independent of the park's formal education program should apply in advance for a waiver of park fees. A letter on school stationery listing the date of the proposed visit, number of students, number of chaperones, and the educational purpose of the visit will serve as the waiver request. Letters should be mailed to the park at least two weeks in advance of the proposed visit.
