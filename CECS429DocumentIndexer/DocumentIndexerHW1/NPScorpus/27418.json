Visitors will see the living, dining, and recreational areas for the eight people stationed on the topside at Delta-01, working three days on and three days off at a time.    Visitors then descend via an elevator 31 feet underground. They enter the Launch Control Center by walking past an eight ton blast door built to protect missile crews from the effects of a nuclear blast. Visitors will see the complicated array of electronics used by missileers during their alert shifts to monitor the missiles and learn what it was like to have the awesome responsibility of thermonuclear war at their fingertips.        Metal ladder and safety cage at Delta-01. NPS Photo   Safety Requirements For Delta-01 Tours  Visitors who wish to participate in the underground part of the tour must fulfill the following requirements:  Be physically capable of climbing two 15 foot ladders unassisted. These ladders are permanently attached to the wall and are very sturdy. Children must be at least 40” tall, six years of age, and be able to climb the ladder unassisted. Be comfortable in a small elevator in close proximity to six other adults.  Be comfortable with heights of approximately 35 feet or about 3 stories. The elevator door is an open grate, not a solid door.  The underground control center was not designed to accommodate the general public. It is accessed by an elevator and a ladder. In the event of an elevator failure, visitors that are underground will need to be capable of climbing the ladder for a safe and timely exit. Entering the control center also requires passing through a narrow corridor.         Why only six per tour? Because the facility was built for nuclear war. A small elevator and tight space underground prohibit larger tours. NPS\/J. Rudy  Getting Tour Tickets  To see Delta-01, visitors need to attend a ranger-guided tour. Tickets are given out on a first come, first served basis, on the day of the tour at the visitor center. Tickets are limited and in high demand. During the summer season, it is best to arrive early in order to obtain tickets. Due to the size of the elevator and the confined space underground, tours are limited to 6 visitors at a time.",
