Originally, these were very plain, multi-family worker housing. In the 1920's they were converted into single-family management homes by Henry Kendall who added ornamental touches like side porches, fancier doorways and white picket fences as part of his efforts to restore Slatersville.       Introduction 1 Slatersville Reservoir 2 Slatersville Library and Western Mills 3 Slatersville Mills 5 Slatersville Church and Common 6 John Slater House 7 North Smithfield Town Hall 8 Slatersville Commercial Blocks",
