NPS image collection  OUR MISSION  The National Park Service Volunteers-In-Parks Program (VIP) was authorized by Public Law 91-357 enacted 1970. The primary purpose of the VIP program is to provide a vehicle through which the National Park Service can accept and utilize voluntary help and services from the public. The major objective of the program is to utilize this voluntary help in such a way that is mutually beneficial to the National Park Service and the volunteer. Volunteers are accepted from the public without regard to race, creed, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, or disability. ABOUT OUR VOLUNTEERS Volunteering is an American tradition that through the years has made an immeasurable contribution to communities, organizations, and individuals throughout the country. A recent poll found that over one-third of the American public has been or is now a volunteer. The majority of current volunteers are also employed in full or part-time jobs. Today's volunteers are active, dynamic, creative individuals of all ages who possess the skills, desire, patience, and time to accomplish a wide variety of tasks. Our volunteers are, without a doubt, Very Important People! Each year more than 140,000 volunteers donate more than 5,000,000 hours of service in the U.S. national parks. Our volunteers come from every state and nearly every country in the world.
