Good places to go butterfly-watching in the parks are the Bald Hills prairies and oak woodlands, coastal scrublands and back dunes of beaches, and in the redwood forest.  Sunny, warm days in spring and summer, with little wind make for the best butterfly- watching.  A pair of binoculars capable of close-focusing (6-9 ft; 1.8-2.7 m) is all one needs to get good views of park butterflies! Download the Redwood National and State Parks butterfly checklist.",
