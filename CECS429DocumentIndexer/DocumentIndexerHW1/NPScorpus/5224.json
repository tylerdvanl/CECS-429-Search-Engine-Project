As such, administration of the park requires the National Park Service and the Navajo Nation to work together to protect and preserve the park resources. Read the Administrative History of the Park for information about the creation of the park. For questions regarding management, please call the Park Superintendent or Deputy Superintendent at 928-674-5500.        The park continues work on the watershed within the park.
