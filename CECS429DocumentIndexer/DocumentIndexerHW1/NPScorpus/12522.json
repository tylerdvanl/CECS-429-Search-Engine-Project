With the many types of habitats found in Redwood National and State Parks, it is not surprising that the diversity of invertebrates is very high.  No matter where you go in the parks, examples of that diversity are easy to find. From the butterflies of the Bald and Little Bald Hills, to the banana slugs and millipedes of the redwood forest, as well as the freshwater mussels found in park creeks and astounding diversity and abundance of  tidepool invertebrates, “spineless” animals can be found right at your feet or fluttering just out of arms reach.",
