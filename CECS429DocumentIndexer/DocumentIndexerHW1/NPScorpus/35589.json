These rock layers hold stories of ancient environments and inhabitants very different from those found in Zion today. In this distant past, Zion and the Colorado Plateau were near sea level, and were even in a different place on the globe—close to the equator. The rock layers found in Zion today were deposited between approximately 110 –270 million years ago –only in recent geologic time have they been uplifted and eroded to form the scenery of Zion National Park.   To learn about the history revealed by each of Zion's rock layers, and where they can be found in the park, click on the formation names beneath the stratigraphic column (below).         Image by Geoscientist-In-the Park David Tarailo, sponsored by the Geological Society of America, GeoCorps Program, 2012.       Zion's rock layers, from youngest to oldest:  Cedar Mountain Formation Carmel Formation  Temple Cap Formation  Navajo Sandstone  Kayenta Formation   Moenave Formation  Chinle Formation  Moenkopi Formation  Kaibab Formation  Zion also has some geologically young volcanic rocks, which cap the older sedimentary layers.
