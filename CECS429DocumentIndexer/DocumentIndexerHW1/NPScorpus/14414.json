Any activities that would cause damage to park resources cannot be allowed.  Providing opportunities for appropriate public enjoyment is an important part of the National Park Service mission. Approval of special uses of the park—unrelated to public enjoyment—may be allowed if not otherwise prohibited by law or regulation. However, the National Park Service can only allow uses that are: (1) appropriate to the purpose for which the park was established, and (2) can be sustained without causing unacceptable impacts. A special park use is defined as an activity that takes place in a park area, and that:  provides a benefit to an individual, group or organization rather than the public at large; requires written authorization and some degree of management control from the National Park Service in order to protect park resources and the public interest; is not prohibited by law or regulation; is not initiated, sponsored, or conducted by the National Park Service; and is not managed under a concession contract, a recreation activity for which the NPS charges a fee, or a lease.
