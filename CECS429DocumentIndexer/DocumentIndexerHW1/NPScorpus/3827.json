This pass is not available at Sand Creek Massacre NHS, as the site is free of charge.   Accessibility Information Physical Mobility: Facilities  The visitor center at the site has a single accessible parking space. This space leads directly to a paved ramp to the visitor center and the accessible restrooms. The headquarters has a single accessible parking space as well, with a single-level building and accessible bathrooms. Seating is available for visitors upon request. Trails on the site are graded for accessibility. However, visitors can expect soft sand, potentially bad weather, and trails impacted by rain or wind. The trail to the Monument Hill can bog down wheelchairs and offer obstacles to visitor enjoyment. The monument hill parking lot offers close accessibility. However, visitors can expect up to 80 yards of packed trails. Typically, these trails are well-packed and in good condition; however, in inclement weather, these trails can be inaccessible to visitors with physical disabilities.   Programs and Tours  Programs at the Visitor Center at 10 and 2 are accessible. They occur in the visitor center or on the deck outside. Both offer accessibility via a ramp and handrails. Programs or tours can occur on the Monument Hill or along the trail to the Hill. As such, the above considerations about trail conditions may apply.
