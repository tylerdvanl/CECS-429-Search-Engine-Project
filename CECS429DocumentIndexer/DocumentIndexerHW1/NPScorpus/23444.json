    "body": "Wall Capping        With relatively few remaining original roofs, the tops of the walls are exposed to weathering, which ultimately causes severe erosion and collapse. The preservation staff caps each wall with several courses of stone set in a more weather-resistant mortar. This cap takes the brunt of the weathering, sheds snow and rain, and protects the original wall surfaces beneath.",
