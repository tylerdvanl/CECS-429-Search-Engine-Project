    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Things To Do     Special Events     Happy 100th Birthday NPS!                Happy 100th Birthday NPS!                      Join us in celebrating 100 years of the National Park Service!  On August 25, 1916 President Woodrow Wilson signed into law that National Park Service Organic Act, which created NPS under the Department of the Interior. Though much has changed, the mission remains the same as it was written by Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. 100 years ago: \"To conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\"         Kick off the centennial celebration on Founders' Day, Thursday, August 25, with a talk at 7:00 pm by award-winning photographer Xiomaro. Registration is required.   An outdoor reception on the South Lawn at 6:00 pm precedes the talk and will celebrate winners and runners up of \"Inspired by Olmsted\" visual art and writing contest for area high school students.    These events are co-sponsored by Friends of Fairsted.         On Friday, August 26 experience Fairsted in a new way. Specialty tours offered at 10 am, 1 pm, and 3 pm explore topics beyond the traditional tour. But don't worry, traditional tours will happen at 11 am and 2 pm.    Our 10 am tour is a discussion based experience centered around the Olmsteds and their vision for a national park system. Is it still the \"sole duty of government, to provide means of protection for all citizens in the pursuit of happiness against the obstacles\" in protecting these places? And if they are protected, is it possible to leave them \"unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations?\" \"Landscape for the Ages\" at 1 pm focuses on the Fairsted landscape and the National Park Service's restoration and maintenance of our 1.76 acres. Join a ranger and our master gardener for an outdoor experience.  At 3 pm visit with Frederick Law Olmsted (Olmsted reenactor, Gerry Wright) and his Park Ranger friend on \"Ask Olmsted: A Walk and Dialog with America's Parkmaker.\" After a brief tour of his estate, there will be an interview with Mr. Olmsted concluding with a Q&A session with the audience.         Olmsted Archives                  On Saturday, August 27 we again open our collection for viewing, and fittingly will be highlighting the work the Olmsted firm did in advocating for and designing our National Parks. From the drafting of the Organic Act that gave birth to the National Park Service in 1916, to the projects the worked on from Acadia to Yosemite, visitors will see how much of our nation's \"Best Idea\" was shaped here at Fairsted. Explore original drawings, plans, and photographs at your own pace from 12 pm to 3 pm.            On Sunday, August 28 from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm, join us for family-focused activities, including sunprinting and lawn games on Fairsted's South Lawn. Experience hands-on model making in our Park Design Workshop. Park Design Workshop times are at 10:00 am, 12:30 pm and 2:30 pm and require advanced registration. This activity is suitable for families with children entering Grade 4 and older.  That evening at 7:30 pm, Fairsted becomes Bear-sted with a free showing of Yogi Bear. The movie takes place on the South Lawn, and families are encouraged to bring blankets, snacks, and an appetite for free popcorn. The South Lawn will open at 7:00 pm for seating, no advanced registration is required.",
