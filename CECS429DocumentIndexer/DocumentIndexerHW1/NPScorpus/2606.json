Most visitors (90%) see Grand Canyon from the \"South Rim\" from overlooks accessed by free park shuttle buses or by their personal vehicles.        California condor courtesy of Steve Mull  A much smaller number of people (10%) see the canyon from the North Rim of the park, which lies just 10 miles (16 km) across the canyon from the South Rim, (as the California condor flies) but is a 220 mile\/ 354 km drive by car.

It is 220 miles (354 km) by car from the South Rim, or 21 miles (34 km) by foot across the canyon by way of the North and South Kaibab Trails.  North Rim Pocket Map and Services Guide. --North                  Hikers Descending South Kaibab Trail   The Inner Canyon includes everything below the rim and is seen mainly by hikers, backpackers, mule riders, or river runners.  The inner canyon is a harsh desert environment with little shade and summer temperatures over 100°F. (>38°C)  Introduction to Backcountry Hiking Brochure How to prepare for an inner canyon trip.   There are many opportunities here for adventurous and hardy persons to backpack, camp, ride a mule to Phantom Ranch, or take a river trip through Grand Canyon on the Colorado River.  River trips can last anywhere from several days to three weeks. There are no one-day river trips through the length of Grand Canyon.         Trail Courtesy Practices that Leave No Trace With so many of us participating in a wide range of trail activities, it really helps when we are considerate of each other. Trail Courtesy Guidelines help protect Grand Canyon's plants, animals and history, and enhance everyone's experience.        How Do People Get Across Grand Canyon?           Grand Canyon Area Map   There is only one way to cross the Colorado River by automobile, and that is 137 miles \/ 231 km from the South Rim Village (at Marble Canyon, AZ) via the Navajo Bridge, a few miles downstream from Lees Ferry, where the Canyon is only 400 feet\/ 122 m wide.  There is no longer an airstrip on the North Rim of the park. That means that the North Rim village may only be reached by driving all the way around - or by hiking across the canyon.   Grand Canyon National Park Area Map (83kb PDF File)        Colorado River footbridge.   If you are hiking across the canyon, the South  Kaibab Trail crosses the Colorado River on a narrow foot bridge 70 feet\/ 21 m above the water.  It is a 21 mile\/ 34 km hike to go \"Rim To Rim,\" with a vertical descent -  followed by a climb - of 1 mile\/ 1.6 km. This is an overnight hiking trip for 95% of individuals, and most people really shouldn't attempt it during the hot summer months, when high temperatures often average over 100 F.
