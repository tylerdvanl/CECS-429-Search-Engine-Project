    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility             Accessibility         Park benches are located along the trail to the edge of Exit Glacier. NPS \/ Paige Calamari  Exit Glacier  A one-mile wheelchair-accessible loop (partially paved, partially compressed gravel) leads to a panoramic view of Exit Glacier spilling down from the Harding Icefield. A spotting scope is available at the viewpoint. Wheelchairs are available to be borrowed at the Exit Glacier Nature Center, when the center is open and conditions allow. There are a limited number of wheelchairs available, and a photo ID will be held by park staff until the wheelchair is returned.  Visitor Centers  The Kenai Fjords National Park Visitor Center in Seward, the Exit Glacier Nature Center, and their restroom facilities are wheelchair-accessible.  Boat Tours  All tours on the waters around Kenai Fjords are operated by commercial tour boat operators, and not the National Park Service. Most tour boats are wheelchair-accessible, but not all, and exceptions are listed on the companies' websites. Any concerns should be mentioned at the time of the booking of the tour.  Public Use Cabins  Both of the coastal public use cabins (Alialik and Holgate) and the winter public use cabin (Willow) have wheelchair-accessible decks and doors. Assistance may be required to access the coastal cabins from the beach.",
