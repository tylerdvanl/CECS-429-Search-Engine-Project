Sandstone Falls Boardwalk A ¼ mile, handicapped accessible boardwalk crosses two bridges leading to islands and observation decks offering fantastic views of the falls and access to fishing areas. The boardwalk passes through the Appalachian riverside flatrock community, which contains a rare assemblage of plants found in only a few places along several high-energy Appalachian rivers. more...   Accessible Fishing Areas: There is a wheel chair accessible fishing area at the Glade Creek Campground. The accessible area is on a wooden bridge over Glade Creek, an excellent fishing location (catch and release in this area). It can be reached at the end of Glade Creek Road from the parking area next to the campground entrance. more...

As part of the community service element of the jamboree, 212 scouts, led by park staff and two accessibility experts, Bill Botten and Dr. JR Harding, competed an accessibility project at Glade Creek. Projects completed included an accessible fishing area, trailhead and trail section, picnic area, and camping and parking site.",
