The Skagit River, and three major reservoirs (Gorge, Diablo and Ross Lakes) offer ample recreation and sightseeing. Points of interest include visitor centers, viewpoints, short trails, campgrounds, and the Stephen Mather Wilderness. A new Environmental Learning Center is located on the shores of Diablo Lake.      Because roads do not go to Lake Chelan National Recreation Area, most visitors travel by passenger ferry and land at the remote village of Stehekin. Passengers can board Lake Chelan Boat Co. vessels at Chelan or Field’s Point.      North Cascades Institute offers a variety of hands-on programs, including Mountain School, a residential program for elementary, junior and high-school students from various school districts in western Washington. Other programs include summer youth adventures, family getaways, adult seminars, and retreats, graduate studies and volunteer stewardship opportunities.  North Cascades Institute operates North Cascades Environmental Learning Center in partnership with the City of Seattle and the National Park Service.",
