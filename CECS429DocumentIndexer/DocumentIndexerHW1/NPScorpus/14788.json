It was in this area that Buckner's division moved from the Confederate right wing in anticipation of the breakout attempt. After Pillow and Johnson launched the attack on the 15th, Buckner followed from this position. When the breakout failed, Buckner's division was sent back to the Confederate right wing in order to halt the Union counterattack.      A Biography of the Commander David Alexander French was born in 1837 in Giles County, Virginia, received a public education, and was a merchant by trade.
