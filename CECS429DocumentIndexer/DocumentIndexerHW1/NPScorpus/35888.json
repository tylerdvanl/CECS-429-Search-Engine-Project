NPS Photo   Â    The National Park Service Teacher Ranger Teacher (TRT) program is an extended professional development opportunity for educators from K-12 schools to learn about the resources and educational materials available through the NPS. Teachers spend the summer working as Park Rangers-learning and performing various tasks depending on their interests and the needs of the park that focus on education programs of the NPS. TRT's spend most of their time engaging with park education projects, leading the park's summer Junior Ranger Camps, learning about park resources,  developing lesson plans to use in their classrooms and in the park with students. Their experience will also include exposure to a variety of work performed in National Park unites by employees from many career fields. The TRT program is an 8-week program from June through July (dates can be tailored for each TRT). All teachers receive a uniform and stipend for participating in the program. Teachers must complete coursework to receive stipend. 2016 TRT Application Due: MAY 21, 2016. Download your application.
