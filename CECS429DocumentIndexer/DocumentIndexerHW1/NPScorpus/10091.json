Nearly half of the Union soldiers who died there were from black regiments, but they saved many lives through their courageous defense.         In June 1864, Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest threatened critical Union supply lines inTennessee. Federal troops were sent to stop him. The resulting battle was a brilliant victory for Forrest, but it came at a cost to the Confederacy. It is a great example of winning the battle, but losing the war.",
