    "body": "1959 NSS Expedition to Wind Cave      Preliminary Geology Report       George H. Deike, III - Staff Geologist William B. White - Staff Mineralogist Spring 1961 Introduction The geology of Wind Cave is complex and different in many respects from limestone caves of other areas. Limitations on time and lack of suitable cave maps prevented the staff from obtaining a complete picture of the geology, but sufficient groundwork has been laid for a number of detailed studies in the future. Since this work is of a preliminary nature, no attempt will be made here to fit the data into the framework of existing literature or to draw detailed conclusions. The sections of this report list many of the observations made. In general, we have attempted to build from the excellent earlier report by Tullis and Gries (1938).",
