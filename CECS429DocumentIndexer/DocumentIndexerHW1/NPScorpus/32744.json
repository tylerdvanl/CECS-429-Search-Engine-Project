They are operated by North Cascades Institute (http:\/\/www.ncascades.org\/) in a new partnership with the National Park Service and Mount Baker Snoqualmie National Forest. The stores are conveniently located within the North Cascades National Park headquarters in Sedro-Woolley (where you’ll also find lots of information about enjoying public lands), the Wilderness Information Center in Marblemount, Visitor Center in Newhalem and the Golden West Visitor Center in Stehekin. At all of these locations, you’ll find books, maps, passes, trail guides, gifts, educational toys for kids and other resources to help you explore and enjoy the North Cascades. And, you’ll be shopping for a good cause, too: your purchases will help fund education programs for young people on national park and public forest lands.",
