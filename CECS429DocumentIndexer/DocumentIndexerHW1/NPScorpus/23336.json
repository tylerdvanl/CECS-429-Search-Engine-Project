Learn about the different cultures that have lived in the Southwest and how each culture adapted to their environment. Careers in the National Parks (6th-12th) What is the National Park Service? To prepare for a career as a caretaker of America's national lands, each Park Ranger needs skills, experience and education.  Corn is Life (1st-3rd) Use a Corn Maiden story to compare how Pueblo people of the past value corn and how the lifecycle of corn is similar to our own lifecycle. Each community is important! Echoes of the Past - Music of the Ancestral Pueblos (1st-5th) Experience ancestral Pueblo history with musical instruments, songs, stories and a dance. Every Kid in a Park (4th) Learn why National Parks and other public lands exist, what they protect, and what you can do when you visit them!

Reading Ranger (preK) Experience history through reading a story with a ranger and a craft.  Talking Trash (3rd-12th) How are the ways we deal with trash today different from 900 years ago?
