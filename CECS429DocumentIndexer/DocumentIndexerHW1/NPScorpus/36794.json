Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act Bryce Canyon participates in the congressionally authorized Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act. Under this program, parks keep 80% of all fees collected; the remaining 20% will be deposited in a special account to be used in parks where fees are not collected. Funds generated by the fees are used to accomplish projects the parks have been unable to fund through yearly Congressional allocations. Projects include the protection of the parks' road investment through overlays, patching, chip seal, drainage, and erosion control; enhancement of accessibility for the physically challenged to park resources and buildings, upgrading of park campgrounds, and amphitheaters; rehabilitation of park structures;and repair of failing elements in utility systems park wide. Funded projects increase the quality of the visitor experience and enhance the protection of park resources.",
