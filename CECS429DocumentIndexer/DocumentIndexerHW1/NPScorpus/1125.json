Courtesy NPS  Service Learning at Rocky Mountain National Park Students are making important contributions at Rocky Mountain National Park. High schools and colleges are using the park a living laboratory for research and learning. Students are participating in citizen science projects, collecting data, and investigating issues. Their work not only provides them with a in-depth undertanding of the ecology and issues in the park, it also provides the park with valuable information.  High school and college students from throughout Colorado and the nation are volunteering and working in the park through programs such as The Student Conservation Association, Groundwork Denver, Rocky Mountain Conservancy Conservation Corps, Environmental Learning for Kids, and the Eagle Rock Internship Program. Their efforts are helping to protect and preserve the amazing resources of the park.   To view a video about the experiences of the 2011 Eagle Rock Interns, Click Here.",
