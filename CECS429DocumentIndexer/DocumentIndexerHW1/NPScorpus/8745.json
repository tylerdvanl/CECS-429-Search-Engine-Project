Are you a full time RV-er or maybe looking for a summer adventure? Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore would like to talk to you about volunteer campground host opportunities.   Volunteer campground hosts work 5 days per week, a minimum of 20 hours per week, staying in a designated campsite at Twelvemile Beach Campground or Hurricane River Campground. All park campgrounds are rustic with vault toilets and central water spigots. A small solar panel is provided to assist in charging batteries.   Hosts assist fellow campers with information and registration as well as providing visitor use information to park staff. Hosts do not handle any money, and do not clean restrooms. Hosts should plan on working in all types of weather conditions and during weekends and holidays.   Applications are accepted through volunteer.gov. The park requires a minimum commitment of one month.   Â      Campground Hosts at Twelvemile Beach Campground NPS photo \/ Ron Jones  For more information ...
