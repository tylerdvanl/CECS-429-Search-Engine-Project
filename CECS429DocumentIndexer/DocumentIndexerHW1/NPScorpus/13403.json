Clearing of the Tioga Road begins on or about April 15 each year and usually takes between one and two months. Predicting when these roads will open is not possible, even in late spring, because weather in April and May can affect plowing progress significantly.           Tioga Road Glacier Point Mariposa Grove Snowpack    Year    Opened  Closed  Opened    Closed    Opened  Closed  as of Apr. 1    2016 May 18    Apr 19    Closed for restoration project  Closed for restoration project 89%   2015 May 4 Nov 1  Mar 28  Nov 2  (Didn't close for the season)  Closed for restoration project 7\/6\/15  7%   2014 May 2 Nov 13 Apr 14  Nov 28 (Didn't close for the season)  (Didn't close for the season)  33%   2013 May 11  Nov 18 May 3  Nov 18 (Didn't close for the season) (Didn't close for the season) 52%   2012 May 7  Nov 8 Apr 20 Nov 8 (Didn't close for the season) (Didn't close for the season) 43%   2011 Jun 18  Jan 17, 2012  May 27  Nov 19**  Apr 15  (Didn't close for the season) 178%   2010  Jun 5  Nov 19  May 29  Nov 7  Mar 26\/ May 21  Nov 20 107%   2009  May 19  Nov 12  May 5  Nov 12      92%   2008  May 21  Oct 30  May 2  Dec 12      99%   2007  May 11  Dec 6  May 4  Dec 6      46%   2006  Jun 17  Nov 27  May 25  Nov 27      129%   2005  Jun 24  Nov 25  May 25  ?      163%   2004  May 14  Oct 17  May 14  ?      83%   2003  May 31  Oct 31  May 31  Oct 31      65%   2002  May 22  Nov 5  May 17  Nov 5      95%   2001  May 12  Nov 11  May 15  ?      67%   2000  May 18  Nov 9  May 15  Nov 9      97%   1999  May 28  Nov 23*  May 28  Nov 23      110%   1998  Jul 1  Nov 12  Jul 1  Nov 6      156%   1997  Jun 13  Nov 12  May 22  Nov 12      105%   1996  May 31  Nov 5  May 24  Nov 5      111%   1995  Jun 30  Dec 11  Jul 1  Dec 11      178%   1994  May 25  Nov 10          51%   1993  Jun 3  Nov 24          159%   1992  May 15  Nov 10          58%   1991  May 26  Nov 14          79%   1990  May 17  Nov 19          45%   1989  May 12  Nov 24          83%   1988  Apr 29  Nov 14          31%   1987  May 2  Nov 13          51%   1986  May 24  Nov 29          137%   1985  May 8  Nov 12          97%   1984  May 19  Nov 8          85%   1983  Jun 29  Nov 11          224%   1982  May 28  Nov 15          131%   1981  May 15  Nov 12          77%   1980  Jun 6  Dec 2          144%   Average  ('96-'15) May 26 Nov 14 May 14 Nov 15 -- -- 92%   Median  ('96-'15) May 21 Nov 12 May 16 Nov 10 -- -- 96%     *Re-opened December 23, 1999 - January 1, 2000. **Re-opened December 16, 2011 - January 17, 2012.
