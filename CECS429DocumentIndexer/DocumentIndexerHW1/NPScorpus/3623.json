The site was conveyed to the National Park Service through a series of legal agreements between the government and Thomas A. Edison, Inc. (later McGraw Edison Company) between 1955 and 1962. It is located within the township of West Orange in New Jersey. Containing 21.25 acres, the park preserves Thomas Alva Edison’s laboratory, his estate Glenmont, and collections in perpetuity and makes this valuable part of America’s heritage available to over 60,000 visitors each year for their enjoyment, understanding, and appreciation.      Mission of the National Park Service at Thomas Edison National Historical Park   The mission of the National Park Service at Thomas Edison National Historical Park grows from the Site’s legislated mandate found in part in Secretarial Order F.R. 9347, December 6, 1955 establishing the Edison Home National Historic Site; Presidential Proclamation 3148, July 14, 1956 establishing the Edison Laboratory National Monument and Public Law 87-628, September 5, 1962 re-designating both as the Edison National Historic Site; and the Omnibus Public Land Act of 2009-Public Law 111-11: reassigning the name \"Thomas Edison National Historical Park\".   Mission Statement   Our mission is to promote an international understanding and appreciation of the life and extraordinary achievements of Thomas Alva Edison by preserving, protecting, and interpreting the park's extensive historic artifact and archive collections at the Laboratory Complex and Glenmont, the Edison family estate.",
