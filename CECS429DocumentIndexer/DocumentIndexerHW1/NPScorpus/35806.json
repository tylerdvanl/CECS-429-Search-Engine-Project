    "body": "Laws & Policies       Firearms in National Parks The law governing possession of firearms inside a national park changed on February 22, 2010. Visitors may possess firearms within a national park unit provided they comply with federal, state, and local laws. The role of the responsible gun owner is to know and obey the federal, state, and local laws appropriate to the park they are visiting. Please remember that federal law prohibits firearms in certain park facilities and buildings. These places are marked with signs at public entrances. State law generally does not prohibit the open carry of handguns, rifles, and shotguns. Concealed carry of handguns requires a permit.
