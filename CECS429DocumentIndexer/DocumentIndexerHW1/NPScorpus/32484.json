    "body": "Explore This Park    Get Involved     Planning             Planning      From the creation of the reserve, Ebey's Landing National Historical Reserve has been managed through partnerships between the National Park Service, Town of Coupeville, Island County, and Washington State Parks. Shortly after establishment, the community worked collaboratively with local governments to create a plan for the future of the reserve. The ideas put forth in this plan were incorporated into the first Comprehensive Plan for the reserve, prepared by National Park Service with input by the community and government partners. That plan called for the establishment of the Trust Board of Ebey's Landing National Historical Reserve, a unit of local government and partnership between the local, state and federal governments. 25 years later, the National Park Service, Trust Board, and community members embarked on a new General Management Plan (GMP) process completed in 2006.  Â   Management Documents:  General Management Plan (2006) Long Range Interpretive Plan (2009) Farmland Preservation Case Studies for Ebey's Landing NHR (2001) Farmland Preservation Recommendations for Ebey's Landing NHR (2001) Analysis of Land Use Change and Cultural Landscape Integrity (2003) The National Park Service and Trust Board may have other plans available to assist them in their work to protect the resources of the reserve.
