    "body": "Commercial Use Authorizations        Commercial business activity is prohibited within the park unless a commercial use authorization (CUA) has been granted by the park (36 CFR Sec. 5.3.) CUAs are currently issued for two year periods for approved services (see application and instructions for details). The current fee for a CUA is $315. The authority for the National Park Service to impose user charges to recover and retain costs associated with managing special park uses is found in 31 U.S.C. 3.a.  Fees for CUAs are non-refundable.  This fee covers the costs associated with the administrative process for preparing and issuing the CUA as well as costs associated with monitoring and\/or performing needed functions to properly manage the activity. There is no right or guarantee of renewal for CUAs.  The permittee must reapply for a new CUA for succeeding periods upon expiration of the current CUA. Liability insurance is required for all CUA holders (see application and instructions for details). Special Conditions pages for Hiking\/Backpacking, Guided Bike Tours, Guided Fishing or Guided Rock Climbing must be reviewed, signed and submitted with your application. Guide Registration Forms must be completed and returned with your application. Each year, an annual survey will be required detailing operations conducted in the park.
