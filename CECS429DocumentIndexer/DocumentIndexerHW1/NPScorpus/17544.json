Please leave your pets at home. Some of the diseases and parasites that now threaten the fox may have been carried to the islands by animals from the mainland. While a domestic dog might have immunity from certain parasites and diseases, it may still carry them. Due to their insular existence, island foxes have no such built-up immunity to many of these ailments and are quite vulnerable to them. So please help protect the island fox and other island animals by leaving pets at home.",
