Rangers will come to your classroom and bring along with them artifacts such as mica, copper and obsidian, to name a few. Pre-historic tools are often part of the program, so kids can expect to see and handle stone tools, animal bones and flint bladelets. Rangers will interact with the kids by utilizing the artifacts and tools and talking about where they came from and what they were used for during daily life in the Hopewell period. This is an excellent way for your kids to learn about the Hopewellian way of life through a hands-on, fun experience that they all will surely remember. To inquire about inviting a ranger to your classroom or for more information, please call us at 740-774-1126 or send us an email. Please Note: Classroom visits are only scheduled November through April.  We are limited to visiting schools that are within a 60-mile radius of Chillicothe, Ohio 45601.",
