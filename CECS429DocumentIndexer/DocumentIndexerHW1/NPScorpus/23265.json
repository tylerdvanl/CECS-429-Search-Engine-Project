Capulin offers a variety of programs tied to curriculum standards and geared toward students of all ages.  Trunk Programs  We recognize that not every classroom can visit Capulin Volcano. In order to accommodate these classrooms, we have created traveling trunks to help teachers bring our park to their students. Trunks are available for reservation using the form below. Reservation requires the payment of a small fee to cover the cost of shipping. Currently, rangers have prepared two trunks covering the volcanic process. Each trunk includes lesson plans, rock samples, loupes, and a copy of the ten minute film Capulin Volcano. Trunk Request Form  Ranger-Guided Curriculum Based Education Programs  Our ranger-guided education programs are curriculum standards-based with an emphasis on the natural and cultural resources of the park. Most programs can be given in your classroom or at the park. The programs will vary in length and can be tailored to the needs of your students. Curriculum-based lessons are available for grades Pre-K through 12th grade and can be requested by using the form below. Although Capulin Volcano offers several different programs, new programs are routinely created so check back for updates.
