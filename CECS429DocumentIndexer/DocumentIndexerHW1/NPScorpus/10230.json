    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Safety            Safety       The safety of our visitors is very important to the management and staff of the National Mall and Memorial Parks. Here are a few safety tips for your visit to our historical sites and monuments:  Pace Yourself   Be prepared for exercise. Visiting all or some of the monuments on the same day is quite a bit of walking. Obtain a map of the sites and plan appropriately.   Dress appropriately for the season   For the warmer months, wear light airy clothing and wide brim hats for protection from the sun. In colder months, you'll want to layer-up your clothing. Check the weather the day of your visit.   Fluid Intake   As you take in the history around you, don't forget to drink water or other re-hydrating liquids. You can dehydrate in any season.   Footwear   Should be comfortable with treaded soles to prevent slippage.   Slips, Trips and Falls   Some of the monument stones can be slippery when wet. Stay on the pathway as you go to each monument and step carefully.   Park Wildlife   Even though it's an urban area, we do have wildlife. They can be fun to observe, however, for your safety, DO NOT feed any wildlife in the park!    Awareness   Washington, D.C. is an active city. Stay aware of your surroundings, stick with your buddy or group, and designate a rendezvous point in case you get separated. Be sure to have cell phones available.   Lost Children   Report lost children to a Park Ranger and call the U.S. Park Police. If a lost child is found by Park Rangers, they will contact the U.S. Park Police.   Assistance   Contact the site Park Ranger for assistance. They can provide guidance for many situations on the Mall including emergencies.   Emergency   If an emergency arises, contact the U.S. Park Police at 202-610-7500 or call 911.",
