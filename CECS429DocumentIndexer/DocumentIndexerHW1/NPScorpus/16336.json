Student Conservation Association Each year Yellowstone National Park welcomes full-time volunteers and interns from the Student Conservation Association (SCA). These volunteers, who may be high school or college students or other adults, assist with vital activities from trail maintenance, bear management, backcountry patrol, to assisting park visitors. In return, the volunteers receive valuable training and experience, have most expenses paid, and are able to live and work in one of America's premier national parks. In addition to Yellowstone, SCA places volunteers at hundreds of other national and state parks, national forests, wildlife refuges, and other natural and historical sites nationwide.

Crews focus their efforts on projects dealing with rehabilitation of trails and backcountry areas, bridge reconstruction, and a wide variety of resource management, maintenance, and research projects.
