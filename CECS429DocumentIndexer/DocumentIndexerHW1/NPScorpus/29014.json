NPS  As a teenager, Theodore Roosevelt fell in love with the area which would eventually become his home. Its variety of habitats - woodlands, open fields, beaches, and salt marshes - provided for a great deal of diversity in plant and animal life. Over the next few years, the National Park Service will be conducting biological inventories for the purpose of documenting the species and habitats that currently exist at Sagamore Hill. With Theodore Roosevelt's own notes and observations, these inventories will be used to measure both the positive and negative environmental changes that have occurred at the site since his lifetime.",
