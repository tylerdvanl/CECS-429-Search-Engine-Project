Academic fee waivers are not granted automatically. Applicant groups must show they qualify for the waiver. There are three criteria the group must meet to qualify for an academic fee waiver: eligibility, educational purpose, and relevance of park resources or facilities. These criteria are detailed below:       Academic Fee Waiver Criteria Eligibility Applicants must prove they are a bona fide academic institution by submitting one of the following:    A statement confirming educational or scientific tax-exemption from the IRS or the applicant's national, state, or local tax authority; or  A statement, from a bona fide academic institution, confirming that the group is visiting for the purpose of providing transferable educational credit based on a curriculum; or  A statement of accreditation, or recognition as an academic institution, from a recognized national, regional, state, or local authority at the applicant's location.   Educational Purpose of the Visit Applicants must provide a written statement confirming that the visit supports a specific curriculum for which academic credit is offered. If the group is on a commercial tour, the applicant must state how the tour supports the curriculum. Relevance of Park Resources or Facilities Applicants must provide a written statement identifying the park resources and\/or facilities that will be used to support the educational purpose of the visit, and how they are relevant to that purpose.  If you tour Fort Pulaski National Monument with a Commercial Tour Guide as part of your commercial tour schedule, you will not qualify for an Educational Fee Waiver. You are required to have a Ranger-guided Tour or, if Self-guided, a teacher responsible for the tour.      How to Apply for an Academic Fee Waiver If you meet the criteria above, submit the following to the address below.  1. A cover letter, on letterhead, explaining what the educational purpose is and how it is related to park resources. (A general statement that the visit is for “educational purposes” is insufficient.)  2. Current, official documentation of eligibility such as described above. It is insufficient to merely state or imply this on the organization’s letterhead. Your fee waiver request cannot be approved without one of these documents. See Eligibility, above.  3. Provide the name of the course and a brief description. The applicant must be providing educational credit hours based on a specific course of instruction.  4. Please include the name and correspondence address of the institution; contact name(s) with telephone\/fax number(s) and email address; approximate date and time of arrival; and approximate number of students and chaperones, including faculty.  Since fee waivers are only for educational purposes, the following guidelines will be used in determining an appropriate number of chaperones eligible for fee waiver. The number of chaperones allowed under a fee waiver is based on the age and grade level of the student.    The ratios of eligible chaperones to students are: One chaperone for 10 College students. Once chaperone for 10 High School students. One chaperone for 5 Elementary and Middle School students.  Any additional adults, excluding bus drivers on commercial charter buses, over the 1\/5 ratio or 1\/10 ratio will be charged the regular $7.00 adult entrance fee.     5. State in your letter that you understand fee waivers are allowed only for academic institutions that are using the park for educational purposes and the planned trip meets these requirements.    6. E-Mail all documentation detailed in the “How to Apply for an Academic Fee Waiver” section above to ron_calhoun@nps.gov.

Academic fee waivers cannot be granted for hardship factors Service, civic and fraternal organizations, such as Scouts, Rotary, and Elks, do not qualify for an academic fee waiver unless the group meets the criteria outlined in this flyer. \"Blanket\" academic fee waivers for all National Parks are not issued or accepted. Groups must submit separate requests to individual parks for approval.   If your waiver request is approved, you will receive an academic fee waiver.
