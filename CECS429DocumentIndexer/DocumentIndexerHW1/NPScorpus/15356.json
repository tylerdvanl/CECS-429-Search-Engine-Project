Following the breakout of war in Idaho, nearly 800 Nez Perce spent a long and arduous summer fleeing U.S. Army troops first toward Crow allies and then toward refuge in Canada. Forty miles short of the Canadian border and following a five-day battle and siege, the Nez Perce ceased fighting at Bear Paw on October 5th, 1877, in which Chief Joseph gave his immortal speech: \"From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.\" Visiting the Battlefield The battlefield is open daily, year-round, during daylight hours.  The first stop should be the visitor center located at the Blaine County Museum, 501 Indiana Street in Chinook.
