    "body": "Road and Trail Closures          Road Closures  • Several ongoing maintenance projects have caused road closures that will be in effect during 2016. See details of current projects at the bottom of the page. The Blue Ridge Parkway Road Closure Map provides real time road closure\/condition information. This feature may be particularly helpful when winter weather conditions force temporary and fast-changing closures. In other seasons of the year, storms can sometimes cause temporary closures due to downed trees or debris.  Trail Closures • Dobie Mountain Trail at Humpback Rocks in VA (Milepost 6) is closed.   • Sharp Top Trail (Milepost 86) will be closed on weekdays from July 18 through September 1, 2016.
