    "body": "Annual Mountaineering Summaries       Each year, the staff at the Walter Harper Talkeetna Ranger Station compiles a summary of mountaineering activities in Denali National Park and Preserve. The links below take you to the respective annual summaries dating back to 1979, including our yearly rescue and medical summaries, a statistical review, and a rundown of notable ascents.         NPS Photo\/Gentzel       Since 1979, mountaineering rangers in Talkeetna have written reports of that year's mountaineering season. These reports are available by year, below. Nearly every year, these reports contain overall statistics on the number of expeditions and mountaineers attempting a climb, as well as a total number of summits, broken down by the route climbed on Denali. Download these mountaineering statistics, which have been compiled into one file. Note: These reports are historical. Keep in mind that certain references are contemporary to the report itself (e.g., calling the mountain \"Mount McKinley\" instead of \"Denali,\" old lists of guiding companies or advice on waste disposal that is no longer correct). For current information on planning a mountaineering trip on Denali or Mount Foraker, please check out our mountaineering info.
