NPS\/Janine Waller       Many of the facilities at Yellowstone National Park are more than a century old and built before the adoption of current accessibility standards; accessibility is not always ideal.  The National Park Service strives to make the park as universally accessible as possible. Extra obstacles will be encountered because of the remote, wilderness nature of this special place.  Facilities described as accessible do not necessarily comply fully with federal standards and some accessible facilities are not marked with the international symbol. The NPS Yellowstone National Park app includes audio-described sites and alternative text for images, combined with your device's built-in accessibility features. This app includes up-to-date accessibility information for facilities and some trails in the park. Download it before you arrive.      Access Pass The America the Beautiful - the National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass or \"Interagency\" Access Pass is a free, lifetime admission and discount pass for US citizens or permanent residents with permanent disabilities. The pass admits the pass owner and any accompanying passengers in a private car. The Access Pass replaces the Golden Access Passport, which is still valid, but can be traded in for the new, more durable Access Pass. You can obtain an Access Pass at Yellowstone’s entrance stations, visitor centers, and Visitor Services Office.      Wheelchairs & Mobility General Information about Wheelchairs & Mobility in Yellowstone Accessible Features by Park Area  Bridge Bay, Lake & Fishing Bridge Mammoth Hot Springs Canyon Village and Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone Norris Geyser Basin & Area Grant Village & West Thumb Geyser Basin Old Faithful: The Yellowstone Park Foundation funded the wheelchairs for the Old Faithful Area Project.
