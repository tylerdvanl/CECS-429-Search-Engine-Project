Vessels must anchor within 1 nautical mile of Garden Key on sandy bottom in the Historic Use Area (HUA).      Mooring Balls The mooring is designed to hold up to a 100 foot recreational vessel. You are responsible for your vessel, inspecting the buoy, and checking that the buoy is holding as intended. Report any problems to NPS staff.
