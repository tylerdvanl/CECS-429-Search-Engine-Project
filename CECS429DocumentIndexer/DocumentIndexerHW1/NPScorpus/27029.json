Whatever Valley Forge means to you, support it.  Â       Roots to the Revolution The Valley Forge Muster Roll Project has made it's digital debut! During the American Revolution the Continental Army used monthly muster rolls prepared at the company level to track the army's strength. Each roll contains names, ranks, dates of enlistment, and other notes on soldiers' assignments, activities, or conditions. These records are perhaps the most reliable method to track the service of Revolutionary War soldiers. Today you can search through the Muster Roll for soldiers by their last name, state, or regiment. Visit the NEW Muster Roll website for details, and let the search begin!",
