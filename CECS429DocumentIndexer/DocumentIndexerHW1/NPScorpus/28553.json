    "body": "Kids & Youth          The story of the Johnstown Flood is certainly one that affects kids too. Instead of concentrating on the damage done, think of all the ways the community came together to help each other recover. The Junior Ranger program at Johnstown Flood is divided by age. If you click on the link for your age you will get a PDF of the Junior Ranger book. You can also get a free copy of the book in person at the Johnstown Flood National Memorial visitor center! Ages 5 to 8 have activities such as connect the dots, scavenger hunt bingo, picture fun, fact hunts, map games, and mazes to complete. Ages 8 to 10 do Morse Code, fact checking, a South Fork maze, and other interesting games. Ages 11 to 13 can learn more about the National Park Service and its mission. Games and puzzles discuss jobs, exhibit design, and other National Park areas as well as the Johnstown Flood.",
