Hiking In addition to the Park's loop trail (1\/2 mile), many visitors enjoy hiking south from the Park along the Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail. A nice section is from the Park to Mau'umae Beach (about 3\/4 mile). For more the adventurous, you can walk further to Hapuna Beach (about 3 miles). Shark, Whale & Dolphin Watching Many visitors enjoy watching the variety of sea life that live and play off of the Park's shoreline. During the winter months, humpback whales are a very common sight. Throughout the year, black-tipped reef sharks come into Pelekane Bay (the best time to see them is usually in the early morning). As well, spinner dolphins can sometimes be seen frolicking in the ocean.   Bird Watching During the early morning or late afternoons, the Park comes alive with various birds. Occasionally you might see the pueo (hawaiian owl) scouting out the fields for prey.
