    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Directions & Transportation     Getting Around              Getting Around          Getting Around on Fire Island After making it through traffic over that last bridge, into that last parking space, or getting on the ferry to Fire Island, you can breathe a sigh of relief and enjoy your “island time.” Remember to bring what you’ll need for your visit. There are no paved roads between communities, and there’s no land taxi service on Fire Island.  Driving Permits A very limited number of year-round residents, contractors, and other service providers are issued permits to drive on park lands for specific purposes.  If you’re visiting in the summer, you should see few of these vehicles. National Park Service, Suffolk County Police Marine Bureau, and other official use vehicles must not be expected to provide transportation between locations. However, most park facilities are little more than a one-mile walk away from a small community. You may also call for a water taxi to transport you between designated sites. By Boat The use of personal watercraft—PWCs or JetSkis—is restricted within the boundaries of the park except in marked channels to some of the Fire Island communities.   If you’re staying in the marina, you may use your inflatable or dinghy for access to other parts of the park or to neighboring public docks. For a fee, transient slips may be available at Watch Hill and Sailors Haven, and at some of the local communities and waterfront restaurants, but space is often limited. Off-shore mooring is allowed at this time without a permit. You may bring your dinghy or shallow-draft vessel onto the shoreline in the park, but the boat may not be tied to public docks or boardwalks.",
