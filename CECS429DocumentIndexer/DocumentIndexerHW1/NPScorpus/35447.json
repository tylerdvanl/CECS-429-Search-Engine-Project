    "body": "Civilian Conservation Corps Pennant          While the men received the necessities of life from the CCC program, a decorative pennant had to be bought with their hard earned dollars. Displaying this pennant allowed men to show the pride felt in contributing to the CCC effort to improve this park and the economic state of the country. Produced by the Happy Days Publishing Company, this pennant was among many types of CCC merchandise available for purchase. Other objects, such as pillowcases or jewelry, could be sent home to menâ€™s families to be displayed proudly.",
