    "body": "Explore This Park    Get Involved     Do Business With Us            Doing Business with the Park       The two main objectives of this site are information about our permit operations and to provide commercial guides with current information about the natural and cultural resources of Coronado National Memorial administered as part of the Southeast Arizona Group.          Commercial Use Authorizations Commercial Use Authorizations are issued to provide commercial services to park area visitors in limited circumstances. CUAs, although used to authorize commercial services to park area visitors, are not Concession Contracts. They are intended to provide a simple means to authorize suitable commercial services to visitors in park areas in the limited circumstances in the legislation.  Special Use Permits Special Use Permits are required for special events such as commercial photography or filming, weddings and other ceremonies, group activities with more than 30 people or 15 vehicles in the picnic area, gatherings, distribution of printed material and other public expressions of views, and other activities that are otherwise controlled or prohibited.  Research Permits National parks make wonderful laboratories. If you are interested in a permit for conducting research in the park, please email our Resource Management Division at Coronado National Memorial.",
