The collection was amassed over a period of more than 75 years from a variety of sources and toward various ends, and continues to grow. The core of the collection derives from excavations undertaken at the Mound City Group between 1920 and 1922 after the decommissioning and abandonment of Camp Sherman.  Camp Sherman was a sprawling World War I Army training camp that was active between 1917 and 1920. Mound City was located in part, on the northern grounds of the cantonment. The excavations were conducted under the auspices of the Ohio State Archaeological and Historical Society. William C. Mills provided overall direction for the investigations and Henry C. Shetrone directed the field operations (pictured right).  Â     Clockwise: Mica Sheets, Whelk Shells, Effigy Pipes & Knife River Flint.",
