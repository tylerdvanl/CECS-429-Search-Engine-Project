The 9-mile road ends at the Exit Glacier parking area. The rangers will meet you at \"the big rock\" at the trailhead. Plan to arrive 15 minutes ahead of your scheduled program so that students have time to use the facilities. Directions to Lowell Point:  Take the Seward Highway south from Anchorage (approximately 125 miles). Follow 3rd Avenue (this is the road the highway becomes) to the where it ends at a 'T' intersection with a stop sign and make a right on Railway Avenue. Railway becomes Lowell Point Road once you pass the big waterfall. Follow for about a mile and make a right on Martins Road. If you are traveling by bus follow PAST the state park parking lot and let kids off at the beach at roadâ€™s end. The State park asks that you then take your bus up to the Upper Parking lot off of Martins Road.",
