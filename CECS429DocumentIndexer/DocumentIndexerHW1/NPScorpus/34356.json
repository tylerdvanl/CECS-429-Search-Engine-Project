Founded in 1889 under the name Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (APVA) their mission was \"to restore and preserve the ancient historic buildings and tombs in the State of Virginia, and acquire by purchase or gift the sites of such buildings and tombs with a view to their prepetuation and preservation.\"  In 1893 the Jamestown church ruins and twenty-two and a half acres of adjacent land were donated to the APVA by the then single owners of Jamestown Island Mr. and Mrs. Edward Barney. Since 1934, when the National Park Service acquired the remainder of Jamestown Island, Historic Jamestowne has been jointly managed by the APVA and the National Park Service. In 2009 the APVA changed their name to Preservation Virginia.      Colonial Williamsburg Foundation Established in 1926, the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation is the not-for-profit educational institution that preserves and operates the restored 18th-century Revolutionary capital of Virginia as a town-sized living history museum, telling the inspirational stories of our nation's founding men and women.  Within the restored and reconstructed buildings, historic interpreters, attired as colonial men and women from slaves to shopkeepers to soldiers, relate stories of colonial Virginia society and culture - stories of our journey to become Americans - while historic tradespeople research, demonstrate and preserve the 18th-century world of work and industry.      Eastern National Eastern National is a cooperating association that promotes the public's understanding and support of America's national parks and other public trusts. Eastern National currently operates educational retail outlets in 30 states, from Maine to the Caribbean. All of the products, programs and publications offered to visitors have a strong educational value and assist the educational programs of the Service. The profits from their activity is donated to the National Park Service and their other partners to further support interpretive and education programs in the parks.
