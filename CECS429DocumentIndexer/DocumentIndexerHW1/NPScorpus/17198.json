    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Pets              Pets       Leashed pets are welcome. Summers are hard on pets here. Owners should bring a water dish if they plan to be in the park very long and never leave a pet in the cars. This park includes managed meadows which are potential habitat for ground nesting birds. Domestic dogs and cats running lose scare hens from the nest, resulting in a loss of meadow larks, bob white and other species. Dogs must be kept leashed at all times, but especially during the nesting season when hens are easily frightened from their nests. Cats should also be kept leashed or indoors. If we mind our pets, we can also enjoy the return of bird songs of spring in the greater Washington area.",
