A river otter’s tail makes up 30 to 40% of the total length of its body. The river otter has a round, small head, short yet powerful legs, and large whiskers. Otters can sometimes be seen along the Savannah River off Cockspur Island.         Mink A mink is any of several furry, dark-colored, semi-aquatic, carnivorousmammals of the family Mustelidae, which also includes weasels and otters. It is naturally found in North America, and can be seen along the banks of the Savannah River as well as close to the fort’s moat.           The bobcat is the smallest member of the lynx group, weighing from 15-30 pounds with a body length of 2-4 feet, depending on its location. Its name is derived from its 6\" tail which tipped white, or bobbed white. The bobcat's thick fur is a reddish-brown to brownish-gray with small dark spots. The bobcat has long legs and runs in excess of 15mph, and can leap over 12 feet, which helps it catch its prey. Bobcats sometimes make their ways to Cockspur Island, yet remain illusive to human contact.",
