Are you a storyteller? You are needed during Pioneer Day field trips for school groups or riding the wagons during Prairie Day in September. Do you enjoy meeting and talking to people? There is a place for you at the visitor center front desk. Do you prefer to stay behind-the-scenes? You may enjoy working in the park library.
