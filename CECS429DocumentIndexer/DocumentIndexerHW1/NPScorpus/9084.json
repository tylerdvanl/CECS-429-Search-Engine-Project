Some areas adjacent to streams support small intermittent ponds, but these have a tendency to disappear during drought conditions.   Adjacent to the park is Hunting Creek Lake. Managed by  Cunningham Falls State Park, the 75 acre man-made lake is a popular place for swimming, boating, and fishing.",
