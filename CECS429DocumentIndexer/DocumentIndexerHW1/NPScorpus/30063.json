You may purchase a wide selection of maritime books, souvenirs and other items at the Lighthouse gift shop.    A small National Park Service-operated visitor center, located on the east end of the island adjacent Smith Point County Park, serves as the eastern entrance to New York State's only federally-designated wilderness area, the Otis Pike Fire Island High Dune Wilderness. The Wilderness Visitor Center offers a bookstore, aquaria, exhibits and ranger-guided programs year-round.   Open Seasonally Small visitor centers are open mid-May through mid-October at Sailors Haven and Watch Hill. Here you may get the latest update on programs and wildlife sightings, see what's in the aquaria, and purchase additional books and educational items to help make your visit more meaningful.   The William Floyd Estate, open mid-May through mid-November, includes a small orientation exhibit and book sales counter in the historic manor house. You may learn more about Long Island's colonial history and one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence at this park site.  While there is no major visitor center in Patchogue, you may pick up brochures or obtain Golden Age and Access passports at park headquarters on weekdays.     Â       You may stamp your passport book (or buy one if you don't have one already), at any of the visitor contact facilities listed above.",
