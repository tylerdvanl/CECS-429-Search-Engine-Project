Echo Park provides many opportunities to enjoy remarkable surroundings, discover Fremont petroglyphs or explore the area's homsteading and ranching history. You can watch watch river rafters float past on the Green River. Picnicking and camping are also available in the area. A spectacular display of stars is visible in the night sky due to the lack of any light pollution from nearby towns and cities.          The road to Echo Park includes several sharp corners and steep grades just after it leaves the Harpers Corner Road.

NPS, Dan Johnson  Hiking There are currently no established trails in the Echo Park area, but several routes do exist. The easiest is a short, level walk to the confluence of the Green and Yampa Rivers. Here you can see the brown, muddy waters of the naturally flowing Yampa River mixing with the clear greenish tinged waters of the Green River. Use caution along the river banks, as they can collapse without warning. This walk starts from the end of the road, just past the river access point. Follow the river shore to the northeast. During periods of high river flows, the sandy beaches may be covered by water. Other off trail routes exist such as hiking to Mitten Park or past Jenny Lind Rock and into lower Sand Canyon. Anyone planning to explore these areas should carry a map and compass and know how to use them. You should also make sure you have plenty of water and appropriate gear for the weather.        A river rafter floats around Steamboat Rock NPS  River Rafting and Boating Multi-day raft trips pass by Echo Park.
