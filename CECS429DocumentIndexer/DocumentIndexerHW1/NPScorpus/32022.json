    "body": "Resource Management Documents        Lucas Pellant       The documents below were developed to provide background and guidance for the management of the cultural and natural resources at San Juan Island National Historical Park. The larger documents will require a few minutes to download so please be patient.      Historic Landscape Report: American & English camps  The San Juan Island National Historical park Historic Landscape Report was prepared in 1987 in accordance with guidelines for cultural landscape reports. It is a technical report that colects, presents and avaluates documentary and field survey findinds and proposes appropriate management options for the historic landscapes at American and English camps. It is not a decision document. The options presented in the report are considered within the prescribed procedures for review and consultation for all proposed national Park Service projects impacting cultural and natural resources before final development guidaelines for these sites are adopted by the National Park Service.  Cultural landscape Inventories  The Cultural Landscapes Inventory (CLI) is a comprehensive inventory of all historically significant landscapes within the National Park System. This evaluated inventory identifies and documents each landscape's location, physical development, significance, National Register of Historic Places eligibility, condition, as well as other valuable information for park management. Inventoried landscapes are listed on, or eligible for, the National Register of Historic Places, or otherwise treated as cultural resources. To automate the inventory, the Cultural Landscapes Automated Inventory Management System (CLAIMS) database was created in 1996. CLAIMS provides an analytical tool for querying information associated with the CLI.  American Camp Cultural Landscape Inventory  The American Camp cultural landscape is a site in the southeast corner of San Juan Island within the San Juan Island National Historical Park. The site is significant as the location of a United States Army camp during the joint occupation of the island by British and American Troops from 1859 to 1874. The cultural landscape also includes the sites of the Hudson's Bay Company agricultural outpost, Bellevue Farm, and San Juan Town. The site occupies a portion of the southeast peninsula of San Juan Island and is comprised of a broad ridge overlooking Griffin Bay to the north and Haro Strait to the south, surrounding scrub-prairie land, and Puget Sound shoreline. American Camp features significant historic resources, including an earthwork (or redoubt), two of the original military buildings, the reconstructed military fence and flagpole, and numerous archeological sites.  English Camp Cultural Landscape Inventory  The English Camp cultural landscape is a site in the northwest corner of San Juan Island within the San Juan Island National Historical Park. The site is significant as the location of a British Royal Marines camp during the joint occupation of the island by British and American Troops from 1860 to 1872. Following the military occupation, the site was the location of the Crook family homestead. The Crook family lived on and farmed the land of English Camp from 1875 until it was acquired by the State of Washington in 1963. The site is situated on Garrison Bay and comprises 1,400 feet of shoreline, a broad, level bank, and the surrounding hillsides. English Camp features significant historic resources, including four buildings from the military period, the Crook family house, extensive earthworks and masonry work, twelve pear trees that date to the early Crook period, and numerous archeological sites.  Sandwith Homestead Cultural Landscape Inventory  The Sandwith Homestead is a 5.2-acre historic site in the northwest of San Juan Island within San Juan Island National Historical Park. The site is significant as the location of a late-nineteenth-century homestead farm and subsistence orchard, settled and farmed by Isaac Sandwith from 1875 to 1902. Situated on the lower slopes of Young Hill near English Camp, the Sandwith Homestead consists of the core of the original homestead, including the home site and a remnant fruit orchard. Contributing features include the remnant orchard, as well as several stone features and artifacts scattered throughout the site.",
