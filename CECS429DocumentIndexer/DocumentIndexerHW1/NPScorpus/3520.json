Clean water is needed for drinking, irrigating crops, industry, wildlife, and recreational uses such as swimming, boating, and fishing. While water is the most abundant feature on the surface of the earth, the amount of useable fresh water is limited. Having good water quality is vital for human life and the health of the environment. Water quality is defined as the chemical, physical, and biological make-up of water. It is influenced by many factors including the surrounding environment, weather and climate, and almost all human uses. It is important to monitor and study water quality so that we can detect and prevent contamination in order to have a clean useable supply of freshwater into the future.",
