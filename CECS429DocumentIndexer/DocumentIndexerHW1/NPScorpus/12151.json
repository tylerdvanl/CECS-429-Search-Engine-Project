NPS\/Illustration by Inge Wessels  While in the park, younger visitors can pick up a free Junior Ranger Program activity booklet at three contact stations: the Visitor Center, Maritime Museum, or the Ticket Booth on Hyde Street Pier.     There is an activity booklet for kids ages 5-8 and one for kids ages 9-12 (PDF 560KB). It's a fun way for kids, and those big kids along with them, to learn about the park. The booklets are also available in Spanish (ages 5-8, ages 9-12).  Once the activities are completed, find a park ranger who will review the booklet with the new Junior Ranger and present them with a Junior Ranger badge.            Junior Ranger Day on Hyde Street Pier, 2013.
