Denali Science School brings Alaskan fifth and sixth-grade classes to Denali National Park and Preserve for overnight field trips. During these three-day programs, students are immersed in Denali's natural wonders through hands-on activities, hikes, and journeys into the park. Denali Science School is instructed by skilled Park Service and Alaska Geographic educators who work with the teachers to enhance each school's curricula.    Denali Science School is free other than transportation and on-site food costs. The three-day programs are offered from late August 29th through October 7th. Teachers are required to submit a registration form to apply for this opportunity.  Details  Who: All fifth and sixth-grade teachers in Alaska are invited to register for Denali Science School. A maximum of 30 students and 5 chaperones (teachers included) can be accommodated per session. When: August 29th through October 7th. Two sessions are offered per week – Session I is from Monday through Wednesday and Session II is from Wednesday through Friday. Instruction and Supervision: Denali park rangers and Alaska Geographic educators provide most instruction and logistical support while teachers and chaperones are largely responsible for student's behavioral conduct and overnight needs. Session itineraries include a visit to the park's dog sled kennels, a field trip into the park, and day and evening science and team-building activities.
