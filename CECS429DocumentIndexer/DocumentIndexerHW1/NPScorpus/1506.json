Bryan Harry photo      When the first Polynesians came to Hawaii, they brought with them the plants and animals they would need to make a start in the new world. In the park you can spot the shiny-leafed noni, with its pale yellow fruit. Noni was used as a tonic to treat many different ailments. You may also notice several stone planters found around the Hale Ho'okipa Visitor Contact Station.  In this dry land, the planters were used to raise crops. The stone walls protected the plants from the wind and coconut husks soaked in water were placed around the growing plants to keep the soil moist. Imagine bringing your plants needed for food and medicine across the Pacific and nurturing them in such a hot and dry place.",
