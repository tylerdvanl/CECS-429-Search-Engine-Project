    "body": "Canalway Questing         Finding a quest box COURTESY OF GIRL SCOUT TROOP 30609  What is Questing? Find more than 40 adventures-called quests-in the Ohio & Erie Canalway! Put on your sleuthing hat and follow rhyming clues and a curious map to each hidden quest box. Along the way, discover the area's treasuresâ€”the natural and cultural gems of the Canalway. Unlike geocaching, no GPS unit is needed and no trinkets are exchanged. When you find a quest box, collect its unique stamp, sign its logbook, and put it back in place for others to discover.  Each year, the questing season runs from April 15 through November 15. For more information and to download quests, visit www.ohioanderiecanalway.com and search under the Activities tab on the top, then select Questing. Quests are also available at Boston Store Visitor Center, located at 1550 Boston Mills Road, Peninsula 44264.   Arrye Rosser, interpretive and education specialist at Cuyahoga Valley National Park, manages the Canalway Questing project. Contact her at e-mail us or call 440-546-5992.",
