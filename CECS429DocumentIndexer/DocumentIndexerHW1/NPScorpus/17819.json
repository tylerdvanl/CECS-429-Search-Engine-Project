John Muir was a man of science who loved to fiddle and create contraptions that would serve to benefit his life. For most of us in today's modern world, these inventions would seem to be in the way, but Muir wanted end results. His works included an alarm clock that was hooked up to his bed and would flip the bed up in the morning, so to assure his rising. Can you imagine? Many of his inventions were so strange that we're not even sure what they were. However, take a look at these photos (below) and see if you can figure out what Muir invented!
