Visitor Centers       The Great Falls Tavern Visitor Center The Great Falls of the Potomac have drawn people to the river's shore for centuries. To Native Americans it was a gathering place, to George Washington it was an impediment to navigation, to thousands of visitors every year it is an awe-inspiring site. Tourists have been drawn to the Great Falls of the Potomac long before there was a canal. The Great Falls Tavern carries on a long tradition of hospitality for visitors to the C&O Canal.    Williamsport Visitor Center  Situated at the confluence of the Conococheague Creek and the Potomac River, Williamsport was first settled in 1740. Williamsport is the only place on the canal where examples of major canal structures can be viewed within a half-mile stretch. A half-mile rewatered section of canal leads through the turning basin, under the only Railroad Lift Bridge on the canal, and continues to Lock House 44 and the adjacent lock. The Conocheague Aqueduct is located across from the turning basin.   Brunswick Visitor Center The Brunswick Visitor Center shares the building with the Brunswick Railroad Museum. For over a century Brunswick has been a railroad town.  This once bustling company town is now a quiet place since the decline of the railroads. The remains of the rail yard are still visible from the canal towpath. There is an admission charge for the Railroad section of the museum.   Ferry Hill Plantation Visitor Center Come see exhibits depicting the history of the house, Henry Kyd Douglas, and the impact the families had on the C&O Canal as well as the surrounding communities. Hands-on area for children as well as models of the house help visitors experience the past.    Hancock Visitor Center Nestled along the towpath at milepost 123 in Hancock, Maryland, the charming Bowles House has seen its share of American history. This house is open seasonally.    Cumberland Visitor Center Located in the Western Maryland Railway station, the visitor center features a spacious exhibit area full of interactive and educational displays about the history of the C&O Canal and Cumberland.
