What may appear as \"junk\" left over by the mines are now considered artifacts and provide clues to how these places operated. Though the amount of this material may at first appear large, these irreplaceable cultural resources continue to disappear at an alarming rate. Please be aware and practice Leave No Trace principles when you visit these sites. For more information on visiting and protecting Keweenaw National Historical Park call (906) 337-3168. Plan Ahead and Prepare  Identify who the property owner or land manager is and make sure that you are not trespassing. Know the rules and regulations for the area you will visit.  Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces  Climbing, sitting or walking on walls or other ruins weakens them. Ruins that are stressed may suddenly collapse. Where allowed, camp at least 200 yards from any archeological sites.  Dispose of Waste Properly  Pack it in, pack it out. Pack out all trash, leftover food and litter.  Leave What you Find  Artifacts left where they are help tell the story of the past. Moving them limits their scientific value and the experience of future visitors. It is illegal to dig, remove or collect artifacts, rocks, plants, and animals from park property. Entering ruins or vacant buildings can be dangerous. Leave structures intact.  Minimize Impact of Fire  Campfires cause lasting impacts. Do not collect wood from historic sites.  Be Considerate of Other Visitors  Graffiti is vandalism. It damages ruins and historic structures. Educate others to never dig at historic sites or collect artifacts.  For more information on Leave No Trace visit their website www.lnt.org or call 1-800-332-4100.",
