Eastern National, formerly known as Eastern National Park and Monument Association, is a 501(C) (3) not-for-profit “cooperating association,” that supports the National Park Service. Cooperating associations are recognized by Congress as a means to assist the educational and interpretive mission of the National Park Service. Cooperating associations provide various services, primarily by procuring, distributing and selling educational material in retail outlets located in national parks. Associations also provide an assortment of services including supplemental funding for land and artifact acquisitions, special events, educational and interpretive programs, and research grants. Currently, Eastern National is the cooperating association for over 150 national parks, and is partners with many other public trusts including the U.S. Forest Service, Army Corps of Engineers, and state and city park systems. Eastern National’s role has expanded over the years, becoming the largest cooperating association in the United States. Since its incorporation in 1948, Eastern National has donated over $100 million to the National Park Service, in the form of direct donations and grants.",
