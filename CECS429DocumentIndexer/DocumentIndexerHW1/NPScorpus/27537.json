Registration for the Volunteer Project begins at 8:30 AM at Picnic Pavilion #2 in Murfreesboro's Old Fort Park. You can join as many as 400 local volunteers as we work to remove invasive exotic plants and trash from Fortress Rosecrans, Old Fort Park and the Lytle Creek Greenway.   If you're looking for some family fun featuring our community's rich history and natural resources, spend some time experience the special programs and hands-on activities located in and around Old Fort Park during our National Park Service Centennial Celebration from 10 AM to 4 PM. Parking and program guides will be available at Picnic Pavilion # 2.",
