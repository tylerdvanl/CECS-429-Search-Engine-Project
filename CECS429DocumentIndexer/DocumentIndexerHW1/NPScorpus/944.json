    "body": "Fire Preparedness       How to Make Your Home Fire Safe Outside Design and Construction   Use ignition resistant construction for roofs\/roof assemblies, gutters, vents, exterior walls assemblies, and exterior windows.   Consider installing residential sprinklers.   Install a fire resistant roof.   Remove dead leaves and needles from your roof and gutters.     Access   Make sure that your street name sign is visibly posted at each street intersection. Post your house address so it is easily visible from the street, especially at night.   If possible provide adequate ingress\/egress routes for large fire vehicles. If this is not possible try to provide a place along the road for vehicles to park and not block traffic.   Clear flammable vegetation at least 10 feet from roads and five feet from driveways.   If a ladder is available place it in an easily accessible area for fire fighters to use to aid in protection.     Landscape   Create a defensible space of around 100 feet around your home. Create a \"lean, clean and green zone\" by removing all flammable vegetation within 30 feet immediately surrounding your home.   Remove low tree branches at least six feet from the ground.   Create horizontal and vertical spacing between plants. The amount of space will depend on how steep your property is and the size of your plants.   When clearing vegetation, use care when operating equipment such as lawnmowers. One small spark may start a fire; a string trimmer is much safer.   Above ground Liquefied Petroleum Gas containers should be thoroughly cleared of all vegetation and preferably be placed a minimum of ten feet away from any structure.    Water Supply   Create easy fire fighter access to water spigots and pre-connected hose.    Â    Inside  Insure that when you leave your home all of your doors and windows are closed to prevent hot embers from entering. Keep window curtains and blinds open to prevent radiant heat from a fire front from catching them on fire. Store the ashes from your fireplace (and barbecue) in a metal container and dispose of only when cold. Clean fireplace chimneys and flues at least once a year and ensure there is a spark arrestor in place. Have tools such as a shovel, hoe, rake and bucket available for use in a wildfire emergency. Develop a plan and be ready to evacuate all family members and pets when requested to do so.",
