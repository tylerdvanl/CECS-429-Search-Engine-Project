Don't pack or bring anything not allowed: alcohol, pets, controlled substances, weapons, or explosives.    The Ferry Ride    Follow all ferry crew instructions. Always. They are good people, they know their stuff and they want to see you walk off the ferry and have a good day. Loading and Unloading - there is no hurry to get on or get off the ferry. You all with get there together. Leave the charging herd mentality back on the main land.  Life Vests - Note the location of life vests for you and young children - generally under the seats or canvas enclosed racks on the vehicle deck. Docking - Please stay seated or hold on to a hand rail if possible, and do STAY OFF the stairs. The ferry can bump hard unexpectedly and occasionally several times while docking.",
