You'll be amazed how well your eyes will adapt to the dark if you give them enough time, but for safety's sake, having a light source with you is a must. But please don't bring a white light that will temporarily blind everyone nearby: instead bring a red light source or convert your flashlight into a red light using red cellophane. Find out why this is important at the Night Sky Viewing Etiquette page. Chairs. Folding chairs, camping chairs, lawn chairs. Seating is limited or nonexistent at night sky viewing sites. After looking through the telescopes, you just may want to sit back, relax, and enjoy the stars. Water. Bring the water you will need with you when you go stargazing. Most Night Sky Festival locations do not have potable water available. See the Safety page for more information. Warm clothes. Temperatures drop quickly at night in the desert. Having a few extra layers with you will make for a more enjoyable experience. A smile. We will be smiling too! We love our dark desert nights.",
