    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Things To Know Before You Come     Getting Around               Getting Around      As the largest marine park in the National Park System, more than 95% of the park is covered by water. Visitors without a boat of their own can explore the Dante Fascell Visitor Center, watch a film or attend a ranger program, walk the Jetty Trail (approximately 1\/4 mile long), or have a picnic. To get beyond Convoy Point requires a boat. There are no bridges or ferries to the islands, and only one mile of road in the entire park. There are no facilities for RV camping, and tent camping requires a boat to get to the park's islands.",
