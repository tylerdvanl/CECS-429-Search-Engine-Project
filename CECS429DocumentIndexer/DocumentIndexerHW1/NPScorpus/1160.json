NPS\/Katja Chudoba  Visiting the park by car is easy to do. The two main roads visitors will travel are Crater Rim Drive and Chain of Craters Road. All roads in the park are two-wheel drive roadways and do not require four-wheel drive vehicles. Start your visit at the Kīlauea Visitor Center located just beyond the park's entrance station. The park is open 24 hours a day, year round. Kīlauea Visitor Center is open daily from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.. Here, you will receive the latest information on trails, ranger-led activities, road conditions, and safety precautions. Because of the dynamic nature of the two active volcanoes in the park, conditions can change rapidly.   \"Born of Fire, Born of the Sea\" is the featured 25 minute film that is shown in the Kīlauea Visitor Center on the hour throughout the day, starting at 9:00 a.m. with the last film shown at 4:00 p.m. Use the links below to familiarize yourself with scenic stops along Crater Rim Drive. Weather may be cool, windy, and rainy. Bring shoes, raingear\/jackets, hats, bottled water, and snacks if you plan to venture out of your car at these view points.         Stop #1 Start Your Tour at Kīlauea Visitor Center   Stop #2 Jaggar Museum   Stop #3 Kīlauea Overlook   Stop #4 Steam Vents, Steaming Bluff and Ha'akulamanu - Sulphur Banks   Stop #5 Kīlauea Iki Overlook   Stop #6 Nāhuku - Thurston Lava Tube   Stop #7 Puʻu Puaʻi Overlook   Stop #8 Devastation Trail   Stop #9 Hike to Keanakākoʻi Crater              Volcanic Fumes   Nēnē Protection     Heed warning signs. Fumes are hazardous to your health. Visitors with heart or breathing problems and infants, young children, and pregnant women are especially at risk and should avoid Halema'uma'u Crater, Sulfur Banks and other areas where volcanic fumes are present.   Nēnē (the Hawaiian goose) is an endangered species that needs your protection. Watch for nene on roads. Cars are the leading cause of adult nene deaths in the park. DO NOT FEED the nēnē. Nene that are fed by visitors learn to beg for food and approach moving cars.          Return To: Things to Do",
