NPS Photo  \"There must always be a conscious effort on the part of the classroom teacher to promote a better understanding of American ideals and loyalty to American institutions. There must be an over compensation in effort to keep alive a faith and belief in the American way, which will counteract the effects of isolation in an abnormal community, and the negative effect which often results from culture conflicts and old world sympathies of alien parents.\" Genevieve W.
