This region has been home to American Indians for thousands of years. In more recent times, farmers and ranchers, Mormons and sheepherders, all called the Great Basin home. Within Great Basin National Park, a representive piece of this massive region, stories of people and of places abound. Humans have left their mark here, too; from the Fremont Indians, who lived in Snake Valley, to Absalom Lehman, discoverer of Lehman Caves, to the mining camps that at one time dotted the South Snake Range. Remnants of former times are abundant. They are worthy of preservation as much as any natural feature, as they are invaluable links to the past.
