NPS       The Harpers Corner Scenic Drive is a 31-mile (one-way) auto tour route from the Canyon Visitor Center to Harpers Corner. Dinosaur fossils are not located in this section of the park. The route goes by colorful Plug Hat Butte, which contains a wheelchair-accessible trail and a picnic area. As the road continues to gain elevation, the scenery reflects the changing ecosystems. The last 12 miles include several striking viewpoints and overlooks, some as high as 2500 feet above the Green and Yampa rivers. Steamboat Rock hides the confluence of the two rivers from view at the Echo Park overlook. A one-mile (one-way) trail at the end of the route leads to a vista with views into Whirlpool, Lodore, and Yampa canyons. Fuel, food, water, and other services are not available along this route. Vault toilets are located at picnic areas and several overlooks along the route. The nearest services are in Dinosaur, Colorado, two miles west of the Canyon Visitor Center on U.S. Highway 40. Harpers Corner Drive is closed at Plug Hat Butte when heavy snow falls. The road reopens in the spring when conditions allow.       Map of the Harpers Corner Scenic Drive and Echo Park Road",
