They looked to the natural environment for food, clothing, and shelter.  Their survival was dependent on the resources they found and their ability to effectively utilize them.  But in the process of doing so, they altered the environment as well.  They hunted the wild animals and cleared the land.  Those who followed them continued to reshape the land and the environment for varying reasons.  Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial combines the commemorative and natural landscapes to serve as a useful example of the continuing evolution of the relationship between man and the world around him.
