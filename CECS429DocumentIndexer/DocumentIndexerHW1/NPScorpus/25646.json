NPS Photo       Comprised of 2.7 million acres on the Seward Peninsula in northwest Alaska, Bering Land Bridge is one of the nation's most remote national park units. Established by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) on December 2, 1980, the preserve aims to protect a landscape that contains an invaluable record of flora and fauna, the history of human migration between Asia and North America and supports an ongoing tradition of subsistence culture.  An opportunity to travel to a land visited by so few can provide solitude and beauty not often available in others parts of the country. Proper planning and equipment is needed for a successful trip as its remote nature makes it difficult to call for help and can take several hours to reach medical facilities.
