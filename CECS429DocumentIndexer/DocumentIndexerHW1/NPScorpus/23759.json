    "body": "Frijolito Loop Trail         Frijolito Loop Trail passes through the Pinon-Juniper woodland and offers expansive views of the surrounding area. Photo by Sally King  Frijolito Loop Trail begins in Cottonwood Picnic Area, just across the creek from the visitor center. The trail climbs out of Frijoles Canyon via a steep switchback path, crosses the mesa passing near an unexcavated archeological site (Frijolito Pueblo) and then drops back into Frijoles Canyon on the Long Trail. Total distance is 2.5 miles. This trail is fairly strenuous and can be extremely icy in winter. There is no water available anywhere on this route.       Birds like the Mountain Chickadee, Juniper Titmouse, and Blue-gray Gnatcatcher are common in the Pinon-Juniper woodland. NPS Photo by Sally King          Tarantulas are commonly seen on the Frijolito Loop Trail in autumn, especially October, when males are searching for a mate. photo by sally king",
