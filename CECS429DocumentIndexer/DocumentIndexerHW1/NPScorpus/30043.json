Outdoor Activities Indoor Activities Guided Tours Nearby Attractions Art Exhibits and Contests    If You Have One Day  Enjoy sightseeing, hiking, and wildlife-viewing on nature trails or on the grounds of William Floyd Estate. Canoeing, boating, and fishing are a few of the water-based activities you may enjoy in Great South Bay, along salt marshes, between Watch Hill, and Smith Point. Ranger-guided programs are also offered at all sites, although schedules vary by season. Be sure to check the Calendar of Events before you visit to learn more about the ranger-led activities available to you.  With More Time  A small walk-in tent campground is located at Watch Hill beyond the marina and behind the dunes. It is available from mid-May through mid-October. Wilderness or \"backcountry\" camping in the Otis Pike Fire Island High Dune Wilderness is available all year. Learn more about Camping on Fire Island.  The marinas at Watch Hill and Sailors Haven are typically open from mid-May to mid-October. These facilities are operated by a National Park Service concessioner, Fire Island Concessions, LLC.  Plan for Travel Time  Logistics on Fire Island can be quite complicated, so be sure to review ferry schedules in advance. Ferries run regularly to the island in the summer months but are limited in the off-season. A water taxi provides service between island communities and park locations.
