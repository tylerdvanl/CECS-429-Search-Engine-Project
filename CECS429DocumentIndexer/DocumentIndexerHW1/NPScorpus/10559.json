The units include everything necessary to present the curriculum including subject areas, grade levels, goals, themes and reflections. Lesson Plans & Teacher Guides help teachers incorporate the islands into numerous disciplines through collaborative inquiry. Education Themes show how the islands can enhance the classroom experience for various subjects. The Weather, Water, and Warming curriculum is a comprehensive 6th grade science unit including six classroom lessons, extension activities, and rich background information. Adapted from the Full Option Science System, this curriculum is compatible with Massachusetts and national standards. It illustrates the difference between climate and weather and facilitates a larger dialogue for students about the global issue of climate change as it applies to their local community and their local national park.      Add A Curriculum Unit Please share your instructional unit for the Boston Harbor Islands with us and your fellow teachers.
