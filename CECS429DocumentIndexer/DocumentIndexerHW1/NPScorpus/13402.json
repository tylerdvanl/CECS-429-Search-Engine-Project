Open trails aren't necessarily free of hazards--by entering the wilderness, you assume responsibility for your safety and must use good judgment. Trails not listed below are open, but may be snowy and very difficult to find from about November through May\/June (and may have other hazards).     Due to increasing bear activity along the Snow Creek trail and the potential for bear\/human interactions the area to the south and east of the footbridge [3.3 MB PDF] is closed to overnight camping. The National Park Service will continue to monitor the bears' activity and will re-open the area to camping as soon as possible. The trails and areas are open to day hiking.  The trail to Rancheria Falls is open to foot traffic (but not stock) beyond Wapama Fall (due to a rockfall).  The Half Dome cables are up for the season. (A permit is required to hike to the top of Half Dome when the cables are up.) Trails in the Mariposa Grove are closed due to a restoration project.  No other trails are closed.   Climbing closures are in effect on several routes each year from March 1 through July 15 to protect peregrine falcons.",
