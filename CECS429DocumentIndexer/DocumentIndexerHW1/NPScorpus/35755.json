NPS image  This extraordinary collection of George L. Frankenstein's five paintings of the village of Appomattox Court House depict this historic village and surrounding area as it appeared in the months after the surrender. Professor Frankenstein (1825-1911) spent four years traveling Civil War battlefields capturing scenes in oil on paper.  The paintings, on permanent exhibit at the Appomattox Court House NHP visitor center, not only provide insight into what the area looked like in the late 1860s but are of themselves beautiful works of art.",
