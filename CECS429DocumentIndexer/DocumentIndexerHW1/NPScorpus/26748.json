However, several front-country trails are fully accessible, and others have portions that may be negotiable with assistance. All commercial facilities and most administrative areas are accessible as well. Some picnic areas have wheelchair-accessible parking, bathrooms and tables. Most park restrooms are accessible, and many of the paved overlooks on Rim Drive have low cross-slopes and accessible exhibits. The only access to the shore of Crater Lake is the steep and difficult Cleetwood Cove Trail. This trail is not recommended for wheelchairs, or for those with mobility or health impairments. Service animals are welcome on all park trails and buildings when on duty.      Developed Areas Facilities in Mazama Village are accessible, including the store, campground and restaurant. The 1\/4-mile upper section of the Annie Creek Canyon Trail begins at the campground amphitheatre and is mostly flat and wide. The trail's descent into the canyon is too steep to be accessible, but the views from the top are excellent.Along with the Steel Visitor Center, there are several trails with accessible segments in the Park Headquarters Historic District. Several segments of The Lady of the Woods Loop are accessible and can be reached from the main parking lot. Most portions of this 1\/3 -mile loop trail are steep and\/or narrow, however. The Lodge, the Rim Café\/Gift Shop and the Kiser Studio Visitor Center at Rim Village are all wheelchair accessible. The paved promenade in front of the gift shop provides views of Crater Lake with a grade of less than 5%. Behind the lodge, the promenade continues to Garfield Peak Trail. This section is paved but has grades of up to 15 %. Also at Rim Village is Picnic Hill, where several sites have wheelchair accessible tables. Accessible by elevator, the top floor of the Rim Café\/Gift Shop offers lake views and accessible exhibits.      Accessible Trails Godfrey Glen Trail is the park's fully accessible trail. This 1-mile loop has minimal cross-slopes and no grade higher than 9%. Visitors have completed the trail in manual wheelchairs and other mobility devices. The trail begins on Munson Valley Rd. (between Mazama Village and Park Headquarters) and winds through old-growth forest with canyon views. One mile down the Pinnacles Road is the Plaikni Falls Trailhead.The first ¾ of this trail is accessible to wheelchair users with assistance, but the final, short climb to the falls might be too steep. At the end of the Pinnacles Road is the Pinnacles Trail. This flat, wide trail ends at the park's east boundary after 1 mile (not a loop trail). Enjoy the great views of volcanic spires, but use caution near cliffs.The Sun Notch Trail, located 4.4 miles from park headquarters on East Rim Drive, is a short uphill trail that offers great views of Phantom Ship and is accessible to strong wheelchair users with assistance.      Rim Drive   East Rim Drive offers several accessible adventures. Vidae Falls Picnic Area has accessible picnic sites with parking and restrooms. The first hundred yards or so of the Crater Peak Trail, which leaves from this site, has a low grade, a wide surface and leads to a bridge under old growth forest. The surface may be too soft for unassisted wheelchairs when wet, however. Farther out the East Rim Drive, down the Pinnacles Road, is Lost Creek Campground. From this secluded site visitors can go some distance up Greyback Road, which has a wide, flat, compact surface and is closed to vehicles. Camping here may be challenging for those in wheelchairs, since the tent-only sites are at ground level. However, the restrooms are wheelchair accessible and have running water.      Interpretive Programs Accessible interpretive programs are listed on page 3 of the park newspaper",
