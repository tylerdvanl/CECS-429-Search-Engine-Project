Glen Echo on the Potomac: A Film Documentary  This 60-minute film documentary, created by Kevin Wyrauch, follows the history of the park from its opening as a National Chautauqua Assembly in 1891 through its years as the premier amusement park in the Nation's Capital. The film contains fun footage of the old rides and games, memories of the park, plus rare interviews with some of the civil rights protestors who were instrumental in winning the eventual integration of the Park in 1961.  Carousel of Memories A wonderful film created by local videographer Cintia Cabib about Glen Echo Park's 1921 Dentzel carousel, this 27-minute movie shines a spotlight on six people who have been pivotal in the history of the carousel. Civil Rights Video This 5 minute video features a short news story about Gwendolyn (Greene) Britt, one of the participants in the Civil Rights protests of 1960 at Glen Echo Amusement Park as well as original audio and video from the protests.",
