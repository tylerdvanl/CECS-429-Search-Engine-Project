As a leader, it is your responsibility to make sure that everyone in your group has the most current information possible. It is recommended that all group leaders contact the park several months prior to arrival. Park Rangers can assist you in making sure that you have the most current information available before arriving in Skagway. Parks Canada has specific guidelines for groups with minors.  Commercial and paid guides or outfitters are required by the National Park Service to obtain a Commercial Use Authorization (CUA) to operate within a National Park.  Group size is limited to twelve This minimizes impacts on the trail, artifacts, vegetation, wildlife, and fellow hikers. Groups larger than twelve are required to camp at separate sites, and follow different itineraries. Please contact the park so we can advise you on dates that will limit conflicts with other groups. Group registration The Chilkoot Trail is an international trail managed by the National Park Service and Parks Canada. All campsites along the trail must be reserved in advanced by calling 1-800-661-0486 (867-667-3910 local\/overseas). When making your reservation you must specify which campgrounds your group will use. Upon arriving in Skagway, groups will need to register and pick up their permits at the Trail Center. There you will be advised of weather, bear safety, and trail conditions. Being prepared before you arrive The National Park Service wants you and your group to have a safe and positive experience during your time on the Chilkoot trail. Here are a few suggestions that may help you in preparing for the adventure that waits.  Make sure that all of your equipment is in proper order and is working correctly. You may want to test your stove, adjust your pack, and set up your tent to make sure that none of the parts are missing. Make sure that you are aware of the procedures for camping and traveling in bear country. Make sure that you have enough food to last your entire trip and proper clothing for changing weather conditions.  First aid awareness The Chilkoot Trail can be an unpredictable place. Groups that are prepared to deal with first aid emergencies can prevent a disaster. The Park Service recommends that the group leader be certified in at least basic first aid and CPR. The following are suggestions you may want to consider.  Make sure to bring adequate first aid supplies and insure that everyone in your group knows how to use them. Be aware of any member illness or injury that may result in further harm while hiking the trail. Be aware of any medications that a group member may need while hiking the Chilkoot Trail.  Foot wear Hiking boots are strongly recommended. Hikers will encounter boulder fields, snow fields, deep mud and stream crossings along the way. Therefore, proper footwear is necessary to reduce the risk of broken bones, sprained ankles, and wet feet. Check list: am I prepared to lead a group on the Chilkoot Trail?  I have...
