Exploring is a worksite-based program for young men and women who are 14 (and have completed the eighth grade) through 20 years of age. Explorer Post organizations match youth career interests and develop activities that initiate growth, learning and development. Currently Posts are collaborating with Police and Fire Departments, Law and Government Professionals, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) Professionals, Aviation, Veterinarians, and more. Students have the potential to job shadow, submit for scholarships, learn the type of skills and abilities required of a specific job, have executive level mentors, and the opportunity to attend national conferences and competitions. Explorer Posts provide programs focused on Leadership, Drug Prevention, Character Education and more.   Teens attending the \"First Night\" gathering will chart the course of the Post deciding when and how often the group will meet. Future year's themes will be decided by Post membership and may rotate through several career options.      What do Explorer Posts Do? The Casa Grande Ruins Post works toward the Arts and Humanities Career Archievement Award which is a national recognition. This requires a series of workshops done during the Post meeting time and a minimum of 50 hours of Community Service done beyond the meetings. The overall goal for the Post is to create videos that will be posted on-line via this website (nps.gov), and likely accessed by park visitors using smart phones and other devices while in the park as well. A partnership with the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism works to teach new skills for videography. Other park partners and park volunteers assist with workshops on photography, graphic arts, and learning flint knapping, pottery, basket weaving, gourd carving, and other Native American Arts which will be featured in the videos.      Why should I join? Because it will be fun!

The application fee is $16.50. That covers joining a National organization and a small insurance fee to keep all Explorers safe while participating in official activities. Time-wise the Post will meet either weekly or every two weeks, as decided by the group. In addition, special field trips may be offered on weekends as well as special state-wide opportunities (such as conferences, hiking weekends, camping gatherings). The 50 hours of community service to earn the National Award will be done beyond the regular meeting times, most likely as small teams.      How do I join? Attend a meeting and sign up! It will cost $16.50 with the application, plus a signature of a parent or guardian if you are not yet age 18. There are no current meetings scheduled, but interested participants can contact the park and we can get something new started. We need at least 6 interested members to run an Explorer Post.",
