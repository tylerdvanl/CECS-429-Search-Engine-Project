    "body": "Flat Water Trips        Fall colors and canoe on the Green River NPS Photo by Neal Herbert   Â    Flat water trips may float down either the Colorado or Green rivers as far as the Confluence or Spanish Bottom. A permit is required for all overnight flat water trips in Canyonlands. Unless groups have their own motors or a lot of time to paddle upstream, take out is via jet boat shuttle back to Moab. This service is available from two licensed operators: Tex's Riverways: (877) 662-2839 or (435) 259-5101 Tag-A-Long Expeditions: (435) 259-8946  People interested in flat water permits should make their upstream travel arrangements before contacting the park. Permits are plentiful - it's more likely that shuttle availablility will be a limiting factor for your trip. The National Park Service does not operate a shuttle service. Labyrinth Canyon The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages the riverways upstream of the park boundary, which include most launch locations. Permits are required for boating the Green River between Green River State Park and Mineral Bottom (Labyrinth Canyon). For more information, visit the BLM's Website. Green River State Park and Ruby Ranch both charge a small fee for launches. Call Ruby Ranch at (435) 650-3193, or Green River State Park at (435) 564-3633 for more information. Permits are not required for overnight use or launches on BLM land along the Colorado River. Distances Groups can plan on covering 15 to 20 miles per day during high water, 10 to 15 miles per day during low water, depending on the amount of time spent hiking or how much you paddle. Camping There are no designated campsites along the rivers in Canyonlands. During periods of high water, camps can be difficult to find, especially for large groups. During late summer and fall, sandbars are usually plentiful and make ideal camps.",
