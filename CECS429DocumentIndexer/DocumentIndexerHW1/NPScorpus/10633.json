Some are volunteers, like Russ Moore, who came here on vacation for decades with his family, and upon retirement, decided to \"give back.\" He's been volunteering since 1987, and remarkably, will turn 100 the same year the National Park Service celebrates its 100th!   NPS Centennial   We are also supported in public service by youth programs, like AmeriCorps Cape Cod and Student Conservation Association. Local organizations, like the Truro Historical Society and the Nauset Light Preservation Society have taken on responsibility for maintaining important historic buildings and they open them to the public for tours.    Partners Volunteer We invite citizen involvement in our planning projects, and we encourage all who visit to consider helping us to achieve our sustainability goals by reducing auto emissions and solid waste, and by recycling.
