The plants found in the park have varied life histories. Some evolved in Hawaii, adapting to life in our isolated island chain. Others were brought to Hawaii by the first Polynesians to arrive here, providing them with the plants needed for food, medicine and clothing. Still other more recent introductions are out-competing our native flora, and posing a threat to our archeological treasures.",
