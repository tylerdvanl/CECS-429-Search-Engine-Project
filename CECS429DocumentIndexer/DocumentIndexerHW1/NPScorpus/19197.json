NPS      see contents of VIP brochure This page is specific to opportunities at the NHT headquarters in Omaha, NE. You can find us along the Missouri River in downtown Omaha, next to the Pedestrian Bridge. Our visitor center is located in the Midwest Regional Office of the National Park Service.   If you're not in the Omaha area, click \"View park map\" in the sidebar to find a NHT site close to you. As well, a wider range of DOI volunteer opportunities are available and searchable by location online at www.volunteer.gov   If you have questions, please contact us at (402) 661-1808, or email lecl_information@nps.gov.   Why volunteer? Help commemorate the legacy of the Lewis &Clark expedition and the history of Omaha by getting involved with your local National Parks site. By volunteering your talents, you help enhance the operations of the Park Service in your local community, and are exposed to numerous learning opportunities in a number of fields. Volunteers have the chance to work closely with the National Parks Service staff and volunteers, and are trained in various skill sets according to position.   Do I need to be a Lewis & Clark expert? Absolutely not! We welcome anyone who is interested in helping, regardless of their knowledge base. Volunteers will be trained on the basics, and volunteering is a great chance to get a handle on anything from the political history of the expedition to the botanical discoveries made along the trail.   Opportunities The Lewis &Clark National Historic Trail headquarters is currently looking for volunteers to help with visitor operations, publications management, and social media. On an as-needed basis, we would also love experienced photographers and videographers to contribute their talents. More detailed position descriptions are available below.    Available positions will change, so be sure to check back even if you don't see something you would like to do now.   Commitment Shifts are available 8am-5pm, 7 days a week, though typically we remain open on weekends only through October. Shift times and flexibility varies by position­—for instance, we ask visitor service assistants work 9-1 or 1-5—but can be as short as two hours, and volunteers are asked to commit to at least two months of service. Our greatest need falls during afternoon hours and on weekend days.
