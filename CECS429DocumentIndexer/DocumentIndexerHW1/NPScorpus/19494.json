    "body": "Guided Tours       During the busy season, Park Rangers lead activities throughout the park free of charge and program schedules are available at the contact stations and visitor center and on bulletin boards around the park. Throughout the year groups may arrange programs as staffing permits. Please call or email the park if you would like a park ranger to present a program for your group. Descriptions of some ranger guided activities are available on the Ranger Guided Activities page. Due to limited staffing, the number and variety of programs is greatly reduced this year.  Â    In addition to ranger-led activities, individuals and companies have received commercial use permits to provide visitors a variety of guided services at Buffalo National River.",
