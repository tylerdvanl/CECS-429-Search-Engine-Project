    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Safety            Safety       If there is an emergency while you are visiting Oxon Cove Park, call 911 or call the US Park Police at 202-610-7500. Parking is available in the parking lot as you enter the park on Bald Eagle Road. Gravel roads are for farm equipment and National Park Service vehicles only. Farm animals at Oxon Hill Farm are domesticated and are friendly and nonthreatening. However, please do not pet the farm animals unless you are participating in a program with a Ranger. Never walk behind a hooved animal. Also, our animals are on a very strict diet, so please don't feed any of them without a Ranger present. Please do not chase or approach too closely to any of the naturally roaming wildlife. Stay back from moving wagons, tractors, and other farm vehicles. Do not climb any of the machinery or any of the fences. Visitor and Staff safety is our primary concern. If you notice an unsafe situation at the park, please notify park staff immediately.",
