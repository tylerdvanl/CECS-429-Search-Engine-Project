Alder (Alnus virdis) Alder is a woody shrub that grows in drainages and on mountainsides in the park. Its leaves are dark green and have raised veins on the underside. The bark is a silvery-gray. Clusters of small green cones appear in the spring and turn hard and brown in the fall.   Alder stands, colloquially known as \"tanglefoot,\" are often difficult to hike through, especially with a pack. Some stands are so thick they are impenetrable. If you have to hike through alders try to follow game trails, but be alert for wildlife.                   Plants in Lake Clark   20 Photos  Images of common plants found in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve",
