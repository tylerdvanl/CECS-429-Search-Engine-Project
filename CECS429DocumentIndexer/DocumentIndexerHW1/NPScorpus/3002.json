The Kaibab Band of Paiute Indians Today  Contemporary life on the Kaibab Indian Reservation blends traditional cultural values with economic development. Programs are aimed at establishing local economic independence for tribal members. At the same time, the Kaibab people are working with other Southern Paiute bands to preserve their history and traditions for their own benefit, and the benefit of the entire nation. Both efforts are a source of great pride.      Governing the Tribe A six member tribal council and a Tribal Chairperson govern the Kaibab Band of Paiute Indians. The council and the chairperson are elected by the tribal members and serve staggered terms. A tribal court and judge preside over tribal legal matters. Tribal government has a full-time staff of 40 people who manage a wide range of social, cultural, and business programs. The energy efficient tribal government building demonstrates the Tribe's commitment to sustainability.  Caring for the People A variety of social services are provided for tribal members by the tribal government. Modern housing development has taken place on the reservation continually since the 1960s. Senior citizen assistance includes nursing care, transportation and meals. Family and personal counseling services are available. Tribal children attend public schools in Moccasin and Fredonia, Arizona.  Building Tribal Enterprises Tribal enterprises are diverse and growing. Tribal businesses include a gasoline station and convenience store, cattle ranching, sport hunting licensing and guiding, and a public R.V. park and campground (NOTE: Kaibab campground CLOSED for renovations as of November 2013) The Tribe also leases administrative office space to the National Park Service for Pipe Spring National Monument.      Caring for Tribal Resources       Cultural programs encompass a broad array of efforts. A primary goal is the preservation of Kaibab Paiute culture, history, language, and crafts to pass to future generations of tribal members. Since the 1990s the Tribe has been increasingly involved in consultations with Federal agencies regarding activities on national parks, forests, and public lands throughout the range of traditional Kaibab lands.  Â            Natural resource programs blend modern techniques with traditional knowledge in managing and sustaining reservation resources. Natural resource inventories complement traditional knowledge about the reservation's plants, animals, geology and water. Special water studies on reservation groundwater resources have been conducted in partnership with the National Park Service, the United States Geological Survey, University of Arizona, and Northern Arizona University. Pinyon-juniper forest management and fire restoration are project areas receiving more attention with the assistance of Northern Arizona University. An active environmental program educates youth on ecological sustainability.      << back      continue >>",
