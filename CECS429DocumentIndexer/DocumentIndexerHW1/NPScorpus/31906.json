Take a New York State Safe Boating Course. A new law requires that anyone born on or after May 1, 1996 is required to successfully complete an approved boater education course to operate a motorboat.  If you are renting a motorboat or personal watercraft, no certificate is required, but you must be at least 18 years of age. Check your life jackets. Every boat must have one U.S. Coast Guard approved, properly-sized life jacket in good condition and readily accessible for each passenger.   Â       Bicycle Safety   Follow these tips for safe cycling on the Erie Canalway Trail:      Wear a helmet.  Always follow rules of the road. Stop at red lights, obey posted signs, and follow lane markers. Be advised that several sections of the Erie Canalway Trail cross roads or take you on roads between trail segments.  Use proper hand signals when turning and stopping.  See and be seen. Wear bright colored clothing and mount reflectors on wheels, pedals, and on the front and rear of your bike. Yield to walkers and strollers on the trail.  Maintain control of your speed, especially in heavily used parts of the trail.",
