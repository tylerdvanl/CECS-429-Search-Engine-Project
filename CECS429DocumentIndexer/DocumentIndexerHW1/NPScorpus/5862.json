NPS   Fort Washington Marina has been managed by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources since 1986 through a cooperative agreement with the National Park Service. In October of 2015, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources notified the National Park Service of its desire to return responsibility for Fort Washington Marina to the National Park Service when the existing agreement expires on October 4, 2016.  The National Park Service appreciates the recreational value provided by Fort Washington Marina and looks forward to working with businesses, slip holders and community members to ensure that Fort Washington Marina continues to provide great visitor experiences. The National Park Service will offer temporary concession contracts to the current businesses at the marina so visitor services can continue without interruption while the National Park Service explores longer term management options.          News and Updates          Sort By: Rating Relevance Recently Updated Title    Show 10 40  per page     Loading results...
