    "body": "Leaf Peeping          Fall Colors   Â      Fall colors stand out in Acadia no matter what the weather. NPS\/Ginny Reams  Each fall, thousands of people come to Acadia National Park to see the explosion of color in the park's forests. The biggest question we hear in the fall is \"When is the best time to see fall colors?\" The peak generally comes in mid-October. To see the status of fall colors throughout Maine, visit the state's fall foliage website. The site is updated every Wednesday during the foliage season. To get an idea of some of the fall views you might see in the park, view the seasons photo gallery.",
