Visitor Centers              Â    The Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site preserves the site of Theodore Roosevelt's 1901 inauguration as the 26th President of the United States, and interprets the circumstances of this extraordinary inauguration, and the impact that this dynamic president had,and continues to have, on the nation. In 1901, President William McKinley visited the Pan-American, a large international fair being held in Buffalo, NY, to address the international crowds.  While on the grounds of the exposition, President McKinley was shot by an assassin.  After President McKinley had undergone surgery, Vice-President Roosevelt was summoned to Buffalo and stayed as a guest at the home of his friend, Buffalo attorney Ansley Wilcox.  Following President McKinley's death, Theodore Roosevelt took the oath of office in the Wilcox home.  He would serve a seven and a half year presidency that would dramatically alter the course of the nation's domestic and foreign policy. Museum tours dramatically take visitors back to 1901 to tour the home on the day of Roosevelt's inauguration.  Tours include a guided tour of three restored rooms, audio-visual presentations, and interactive exhibits. The TR Inaugural Site is open year-round, seven days a week.  The historic home can only be viewed by a guided tour.
