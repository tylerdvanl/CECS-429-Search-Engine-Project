    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Places To Go     Lady Bird Johnson Park              Lady Bird Johnson Park       Lady Bird Johnson earned many awards, including a Presidential Medal of Freedom for her work to transform the American landscape and preserve its natural beauty as a national treasure. In 1968 Columbia Island was renamed in her honor. Graceful plantings and picturesque views recall her conviction that beauty can make the world less grim and tense.             Things to Do Landscape architects have acted subtly on most sections of the parkway, but their work in Lady Bird Johnson Park is a bit like the finale of a fireworks display. Thousands of daffodils and hundreds of tulips trumpet the arrival of each spring; careful compositions of bright hardwood trees highlight the best of fall foliage. Photography, picnicking, and quiet contemplation are ways to enjoy the show. Two memorials are located inside Lady Bird Johnson Park: the Lyndon Baines Johnson Memorial Grove on the Potomac and the Navy and Marine Memorial. To request a ranger program at Lady Bird Johnson Park call 703‑235-1530. Hours & Seasons The grounds at Lady Bird Johnson Park are open year-round from 6 am to 10 pm.
