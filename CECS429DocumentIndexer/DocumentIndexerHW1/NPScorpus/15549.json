    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility             Accessibility       The National Park Service does not manage any of the trails or sites along the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail (except for those that fall within national park boundaries). We encourage all visitors to contact the local land managers of trail segments when planning their visits.   Contact us if you would like assistance contacting the appropriate land management agency.      More information about trail accessibility guidelines In 2002, the Federal Register published Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines pertaining to recreation; however, the guidelines did not cover outdoor facilities, such as trails.    In November 2013, the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board issued a rule that amends the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Guidelines for Outdoor Developed Areas. The final rule ensures that camping facilities, picnic facilities, viewing areas trails and beach access routes constructed or altered by or on behalf of federal agencies, including the Department of Agriculture (Forest Service); Department of Defense (Army Corps of Engineers); and Department of the Interior (Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service), be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.    The guidelines are not applicable to trails designated for another use, such as mountain biking or equestrian, whether or not pedestrians will be utilizing the trails. Way-finding signs for these types of trails are necessary. The guidelines also recognize that full compliance with the guidelines will frequently be limited by environmental constraints.",
