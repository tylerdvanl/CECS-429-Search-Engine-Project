Friends of Bighorn Lake is a local organization that helps the park in many ways. Their members help organize, and manage, the annual triathlon at Horseshoe Bend each July. They have often worked in our visitor center when the park has all-employee meetings so that the front desk is staffed. Their members have helped create a waterways trail booklet, and they send us reports on the dam operations for the lake. If you would like to help the park, and the Friends of Bighorn Lake, check out their web site at: bighornlake.com. Western National Parks Association is a nonprofit organization that serves 66 parks in the West. They help develop products and services that connect the visitors to the parks. You can become a member of western National, which will give you discounts at Western National gift shops in the parks. Your membership helps support Western National  partner parks. Contact Western National at: wnpa.org.",
