    "body": "Monument Repair and Restoration       In 2008, the United Daughters of the Confederacy, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Vermont Monuments were cleaned and restored. This was the first time that a thorough top-to-bottom cleaning of these monuments had been undertaken since they were first constructed in the early 20th century.        UDC monument cleaning process and after completion   Using biodegradable and non-toxic agents, all the monuments were cleaned of biological growth and other contaminants. Areas of damage were carefully repaired, and missing elements were replaced where needed. On the United Daughters of the Confederacy Monument, for example, the bronze rivets that help secure the tablet to the monument were missing. The Pennsylvania Monument was missing several of its fence brackets. These missing elements were refabricated to match the originals and installed.        VT monument steps restoration   Probably as a result of road maintenance, the granite steps leading to the Vermont Monument had been moved around over the years, which made them unstable and a tripping hazard. A new base for the steps was created using stone dust and gravel, and the steps were re-set in their historic configuration. As a final step, the monument grounds were regraded, and their bronze tablets were cleaned, polished, and waxed. Restoration and repair of the monuments was undertaken by Monocacy National Battlefield staff, with guidance and assistance from the National Park Service National Capital Regional Architectural Conservator.                   Thomas House Dormer Repairs   8 Photos            Worthington House Restoration   5 Photos            Thomas House Roof Project   6 Photos              Best Farm Main House   11 Photos            Best Farm Secondary House   10 Photos            2008 Monument Projects   15 Photos              Best Farm Stone Barn Preservation   13 Photos            Thomas Farm Blacksmith Shop Project   4 Photos            Thomas Bank Barn \/ Silo Restoration   15 Photos              14th New Jersey Monument Project   13 Photos",
