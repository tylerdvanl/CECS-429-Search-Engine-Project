Did you know Kings Mountain National Military Park is not a Civil War park? Did you know that most battles\/skirmishes of the Revolutionary War took place in South Carolina? If not, then welcome to Kings Mountain National Military Park, the “turning point” of the Revolutionary War, where on October 7, 1780, an hour long battle changed the course of the Revolutionary War.   By exploring our Visitor Center, which includes a 26 minute film, exhibit area and 1.5 mile battlefield trail, you will learn why the battle occurred, who the Overmountain men were and how the outcome of the battle changed the course of the Revolutionary War.   Every October 7th, the Park honors those who fought at Kings Mountain by holding a morning wreath laying ceremony at the US Monument and a program in the amphitheater at 3:00, the time the battle began. Throughout the year, the Kings Mountain Backcountry Militia, along with other revolutionary war demonstration groups, hold special events show casing militia service, weapons, equipment, life skills such as leatherworking, blacksmithing and woodworking as it would have been in the 1700’s. Please check our special events page for dates and event details.   So come, take a step back in time, and enjoy our little known piece of history!",
