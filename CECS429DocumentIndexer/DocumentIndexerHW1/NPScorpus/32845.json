    "body": "Camping in Stehekin      Stehekin offers camping in a range of settings, from lakeside sites to quiet roadside camps to backpacking sites. Most camps are small, primitive sites, and all camping (with the exception of lakeside sites) requires a free backcountry permit, available from the Golden West Visitor Center (509-699-2080, ext. 14).  Lakeside sites do not require a backcountry permit, but private boaters may need to obtain a Federal Dock permit if using one of the docks.
