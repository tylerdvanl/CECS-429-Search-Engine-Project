If a particular service or issue is not mentioned below, such as alternate formats for print materials, audio description, assistive listening, captions, or physical access to particular facilities, programs or services, please contact the park. U.S citizens or permanent residents with permanent disabilities qualify for the Interagency Access Pass, which provides free or discounted access to over 2,000 Federal recreation sites. Physical\/Mobility Accessibility The following facilities and destinations are ADA-compliant:  ·Lake Meredith Headquarters Building Deaf\/Hearing Loss Accessibility  For visitors with hearing impairments, a variety of publications may be obtained at park headquarters. Wayside exhibits with illustrations and text on natural and cultural features are situated throughout the park. Blind\/Low Vision Accessibility Headquarters exhibits include tactile models and rock samples that may be touched. Recorded descriptions of exhibits or waysides are not available. Service Animals Service animals are allowed in national parks. For a definition of a service animal, please visit the ADA Regulations on Service Animals. Service animals are permitted everywhere at Lake Meredith. Owners are encouraged to identify their working service animal, such as with a vest. Identification is not required, but helps prevent unwarranted \"dog on trail\" complaints from other visitors. There are no plastic bags provided at trailheads for waste products, so please bring your own. A Special Note about Dogs during Hunting Season… In accordance with 36 C.F.R. 2.15, the use of dogs to aid in hunting activities is permitted. \"In park areas where hunting is allowed, dogs may be used in support of these activities in accordance with applicable Federal and State laws and in accordance with conditions which may be established by the superintendent.\" Caution! The high plains ecosystem can be deadly for pets. Car temperatures rise quickly in the sun, even on cool days. Your pet can easily die of heat exhaustion. If you are leaving a pet in a car, crack the windows as much as possible and leave water to drink. We recommend you not leave pets in the car at all when the outside temperature exceeds 68 degrees, even with the windows cracked.",
