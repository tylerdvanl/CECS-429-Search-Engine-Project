    "body": "GMP Foundation Documents       As a standard component of a park's general management planning process, park managers and planners pause to reflect on the very foundation upon which a unit of the National Park System (NPS) was established. This starts with a review of the park's enabling legislation, relevant laws and policies, and its latest general management plan (1977 GMP), followed by a period of public scoping. At Fire Island National Seashore, several meetings and workshops over the past years have also contributed to the planning process.            Fire Island Communities Civic Engagement Roundtable In the summer of 2006, Fire Island National Seashore undertook a civic engagement project in advance of the park's new GMP. This report summarizes the results and conveys the spirit generated from this historic meeting between the park and its community stakeholders. July 2006  Fire Island Communities Civic Engagement Roundtable           Stakeholders' Foundation Workshop  This workshop was planned as an opportunity for the GMP planning team to solicit input from a variety of citizens representing a range of communities and interest groups. Approximately 40 people attended the two-day event. These included community leaders, property and business owners, elected officials, municipal employees, and representatives from friends groups and environmental organizations.
