Rather than generating its energy from sunlight it receives its energy from photosynthetic trees. Since it does not need sunlight in order to grow Indian pipe can grow in some off the darkest areas of a forest.         Skunk Cabbage, Symplocarpus foetidus Breaking or tearing the leaves produces a pungent odor similar to a skunk.
