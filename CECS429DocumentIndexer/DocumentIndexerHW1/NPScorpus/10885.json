Save on gas  leave your car where you're staying and walk, bike, or ride the fare-free Island Explorer Bus enjoy a car-free biking experience on any part of the 45-mile long carriage road system catch the views from a hiking trail  New experiences  Early birds: check out our most iconic views before everyone else by getting up early Sunrise and sunset solitude: Cadillac Mountain may be the most popular place to watch sunrise or sunset, but that means it's also the busiest  Night owls: full moon walks across Sand Beach, shooting stars over Cadillac Mountain, owl calls in the still of the night... half the fun in the park is after dark!
