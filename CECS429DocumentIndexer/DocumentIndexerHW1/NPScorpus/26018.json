Click here to view the text of Alvin McDonald's diary, or click on the purple page descriptions to download a PDF of the pages associated with that month or topic.  You can also look at individual pages by clicking on the page numbers to download a PDF of each handwritten page of his diary. Each page is a separate file (50-200 k). A good place to start is in January as earlier pages are mostly monetary accounts.   The months (in purple) contain all of the days listed to the side. The pages are numbered consecutively as they are found in the diary; however Alvin skipped some numbers and duplicated others causing some confusion.           Monetary Accounts (JPEGs) 3\/181, 4\/180, 5\/179, 6\/178, 7\/177, 8\/176, 9\/175, 10\/174, (11\/173 are blank), 12\/172, 13\/171, 14\/170-19\/165 are blank, 20\/164. 21\/163, 22\/164 (blank) January 1891 ¦ 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51,  52, 53,   February 1891  ¦ 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71 March 1891 ¦ 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88  April 1891 ¦ 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106  May 1891 ¦ 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 June 1891 ¦ 117 118 119 120 121 123  July 1891 ¦ 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 August 1891 ¦ 134 September 1891 ¦ 135 136 138  January - February 1892 ¦ 139 140 141  March 1892  ¦ 142 143 144 145 146 146a 147 148 149 150 (148) 152 (156) 153 (157)  June - July 1892 ¦ 154 (158)155 (159)156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 miscellaneous pages 174 175 176 180 181 Cover",
