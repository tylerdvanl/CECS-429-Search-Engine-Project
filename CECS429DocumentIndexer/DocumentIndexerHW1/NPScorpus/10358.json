    "title": "Mississippi National River & Recreation Area: The River Ranger Program",
    "body": "The River Ranger Program          River Rangers are students who have made the Mississippi River an important part of their college experience. Some work on service projects such as river cleanup, while others undertake research on some aspect of river life. All Rangers are affiliated with the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area. At this time the program is based at the University of Minnesota's Institute on the Environment, but as the program grows, River Rangers will be drawn from many local schools. Check out the River Ranger page for more information. Involvement in the River Ranger program connects students to the many great local places, programs, and learning opportunities within the park, and can meet some requirements for your major or connect you to the National Park Service. The River Ranger program is inspired by the pledge our Junior Rangers take to \"explore, learn about, and protect the Mississippi River.\" It's your river on your campus. Why wouldn't you want to become involved? The River Ranger program helps connect students to the river, and as a student, you can get you as involved as you like. There are no fees and it is a great, fun yet informative learning opportunity. For information about the program, simply contact us to receive e-mails. You will receive information about the public programs that might be of interest, as well as notice of special programs specifically for River Rangers.
