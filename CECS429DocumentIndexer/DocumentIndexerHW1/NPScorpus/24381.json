    "body": "Commercial Filming Program       The professional photography and commercial filming programs have been merged, and the permits available per day are divided between the two programs. Some weeks there may be up to three slots available for professional photographers, but for other weeks there will be a maximum of one. Check out a calendar of blackout and available dates.   Several documents contain the information you will need regarding commercial filming in Denali National Park & Preserve. Please read them carefully and follow the instructions for returning the application.  Once you return the application for filming and a $200 application fee, your application will be reviewed and a determination made whether to proceed or whether additional information is necessary. If the information included in the application is sufficient, you will be sent a copy of the permit and separate general terms and permit conditions. You will then need to return the completed signed permit and conditions. Please allow 30 days for processing.  For those of you who have filmed in Denali prior to 1998, you will note that the process has changed. This process complies with the new National Park Guidelines for Special Park Uses, to create more complete administrative records and to prepare to manage not just small projects but larger, more complex productions as well. Please take note that additional fees for spot monitoring have been established and the Denali National Park and Preserve Photographers Code of Ethics was revised.  All applicants will receive the same information and projects will be managed according to the established guidelines. The preferred method of payment of the $200 application fee is through www.pay.gov. Alternatively, checks or money orders should be made payable to the National Park Service and are non-refundable. Payment can be sent to the following address: Denali National Park and Preserve  Attention: Commercial Filming\/Photography Post Office Box 9 Denali Park, Alaska 99755   Commercial film permit overview   Commercial filming application  Long form application, with additional logistical information if needed   Supplemental filming questionnaire (PDF)   Filming guidelines for Denali National Park and Preserve   Denali National Park and Preserve Photographers Code of Ethics   Thank you for your interest in filming in Denali National Park and Preserve.
