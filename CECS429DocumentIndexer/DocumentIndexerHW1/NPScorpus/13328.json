    "body": "Art & Photography         \"Royal Arches\" watercolor painting by Chris Jorgensen.    Yosemite's epic scenery freely lends itself to the artist's eye like only a few places can. For many, Yosemite is a natural source of never-ending inspiration. The bouncing of light, graceful effervescence of water, and stoic mountain lines have provoked artists of all backgrounds and mediums to create works of art. Not surprisingly, many artists have played a role- directly or indirectly- in the promotion and protection of Yosemite National Park. Recognizing this meaningful influence in Yosemite's history, various opportunities to explore art in its many forms are available to visitors.  Art classes ($10 per student\/day) are offered spring through fall in Yosemite Valley. All workshops meet at the Yosemite Art Center, located near the Village Store. Supplies can also be purchased there. The Yosemite Museum Gallery displays exhibits of Yosemite art during spring and summer. The Ansel Adams Gallery offers work of Ansel Adams, contemporary photographers, and other fine artists. In addition, a wide selection of handcrafts, books, gifts, and photography supplies is available. The gallery also offers a range of photography walks, classes, and workshops throughout the year (check Yosemite Guide for listings).  The Yosemite Conservancy's Outdoor Adventures program offers art and photography seminars throughout the park. The Yosemite Renaissance offers an artist-in-residence program.",
