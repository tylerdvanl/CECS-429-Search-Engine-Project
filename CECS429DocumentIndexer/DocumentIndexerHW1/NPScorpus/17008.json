    "body": "For Kids       SUMMER ACTIVITIES There are lots of things for kids to do while visiting Devils Postpile National Monument. The Junior Ranger program is a great place to start. Kids of all ages are encouraged to participate in the program.  Ranger led hikes and programs are also offered daily in the summer and are a great way to learn more about the monument. Special events and programs may be available. Please check the Events Calendar for more information. WINTER EVENTS The monument is not open in the winter, but rangers from Devils Postpile occasionally present programs at locations in the Town of Mammoth Lakes. Once a month, rangers participate in the Mammoth Lakes Library Story Hour. For dates and times, see the Events Calendar. Other programs will be posted there as they are available.",
