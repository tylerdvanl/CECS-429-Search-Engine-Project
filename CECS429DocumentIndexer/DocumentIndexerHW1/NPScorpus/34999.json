    "body": "Rock Strata       This sequence shows the deposited layers from youngest (top) to oldest (bottom). For clarity, the entire record of visible layers in this area is shown, including those not found in Canyonlands. Older rocks are not exposed in SE Utah, except for Precambrian rocks along the Colorado River in Westwater Canyon. Geologic names are actively debated and vary regionally, so sometimes two names are listed. You may download the park geology brochure with its detailed stratigraphic (rock layers) column here. Dominant layers in Canyonlands include Navajo Sandstone through the Paradox Formation.
