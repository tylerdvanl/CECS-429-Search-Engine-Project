A project to upgrade the marina is in the development phase and will likely begin in the fall of 2016. When further information on marina closure becomes available, it will be posted on this page and under park alerts. Escape to Watch Hill Watch Hill is located on the western edge of the Otis Pike Fire Island High Dune Wilderness, directly across the Great South Bay from Patchogue, Long Island. It is accessible by Watch Hill Ferry, private boat, and foot only. The Watch Hill area offers a visitor center, a family campground, ranger-led interpretive programs (including guided canoe trips), a 183-slip transient marina with water, electric, and pump-out station; a small convenience store, snack bar, self-guiding nature trail, picnic area, lifeguarded beach (summer only), restrooms, bathhouse, and pay phones. The Pier at Watch Hill, a concession-operated full service restaurant with seating for 90, accepts reservations and transient dockage is available for patrons. The Watch Hill General Store and Snack Bar are open daily mid-May through mid-September, then weekends through mid-October.  Boat to Fire Island The Watch Hill Marina can accommodate boats with a draft to 5 feet and a 10- to 13-foot beam. A few slips can handle up to 20-foot wide vessels.

Pets are never allowed on lifeguarded beaches. You may walk your dog on the trails at Watch Hill or on the bay beach, but please remember: Pets must always be leashed.
