Carson files  Serenity.  Solitude.  Sensational.  These are words that aptly describe wintertime at Mammoth Cave National Park.  The trees have begun their long winter's nap.  The deer have on their thick coats and the squirrels are bundled up with their autumn harvest.  Without leaves, the unique features that helps sustain this cave country become clear.  Rocky bluffs, steep ridges, deep valleys and flat ridge tops take center stage on the landscape.  If you want to feel you have the park all to yourself come take a winter hike or enjoy a back country campsite free of charge.  While the surface may be subject to winter's chill, the cave becomes a warm refuge from the frosted forest.  Come and explore the calm and quietness in nature that cannot be found under any roof.
