Swells and swales, creek crossings and river routes, dips and ruts: all these signify an international highway of the past! You can follow the paths of emigrants, pony express riders, forty-niners, freighters, entrepreneurs, and stagecoach drivers. Imagine these long-ago times as you travel to historic rendezvous points and scout natural landmarks across the countryside. These tell-tale signs will help you find and explore the many places and stories of the Oregon National Historic Trail.             Click here to find out how to create a custom sign plan for your area by working with National Trails Intermountain Region staff.          Auto Tour Route signs guide you along all weather roads that more or less follow the historic route of the trail. Look for Historic Site Name signs that clue you into places to experience on the trail. Did Narcissa Whitman pass this way on her journey from New York state to Walla Walla Fort now known as Walla Walla, Washington?         Local Tour Route signs direct you over varied terrain following local low speed, rural, and even dirt roads. They follow a number of historic trail sites or segments in a small geographic area. Take time to visit sites today that remain similar to how emigrants saw them, such as Alcove Spring in Kansas.         Crossing signs alert you to locations where the historic trail crossed an existing road. But what crossed the road? Will you see evidence of an old wagon wheel path?         Original Route signs are exclusive. These signs tell you that you are on roads well documented as being the original trail. Travel past Independence Rock and Devil's Gate in Wyoming and you will intersect and align with the main route four historic trails followed over the Continental Divide.         Historic Site Name signs steer you to historic trail sites or segments. Emigrants carved their name on rock faces while passing by on what we now call Register Cliff in Wyoming.       When you see a Site Identification sign, such as Gardner, Kansas (above), you know you have arrived at the entrance to a historic site, segment, or interpretive facility.
