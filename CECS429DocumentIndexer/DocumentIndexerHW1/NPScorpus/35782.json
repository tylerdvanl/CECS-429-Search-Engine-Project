    "body": "Accessibility         Because the graveled path is on an incline, it is difficult in a wheelchair. NPS Image  Much of the village terrain is relatively flat, but, there is a one-hundred yard walk uphill from the parking lot to get into the village. Surfaces in the village are gravel, dirt, and grass. Due to the historic nature of the historic village, most buildings are not accessible to wheelchairs. Many of these structures feature steps to enter and narrow hallways. In the visitor center there is a 15-minute film that shows at the top of the hour and at the bottom of the hour. The film is shown in the upstairs auditorium, but may also be seen on the first floor. Exhibits are located on the second floor, accessible by stairs only. A picture album of the second floor exhibits and other areas of the park that are not accessible is available in the visitor center. Wheelchairs may be borrowed at the visitor center, on a first come first serve basis. There is no charge for loan of wheelchairs, but we ask for a driverâ€™s license while the chair is on loan. Visitors should note that while wheelchairs can be taken all around the park, the gravel and dirt surfaces can make it relatively strenuous work. For braille readers, there is a table-top braille map of the village and a braille guidebook of the village available in the visitor center.",
