    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Directions & Transportation     Getting Around              Getting Around      Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve has six sites scattered throughout south Louisiana. The Directions & Transportation page has links to maps of all six sites and links to information about what each site offers. All sites are accessible by car.  Airports serve New Orleans (airport information for Louis Armstrong International Airport, including ground transportation information) and Lafayette (airport information for Lafayette Regional Airport). Public transportation is available in Lafayette, but it does not go to the Acadian Cultural Center. Public transportation in New Orleans runs throughout the city, but note that although the Barataria Preserve and Chalmette Battlefield\/Chalmette National Cemetery are in the greater New Orleans area, they are in different parishes (counties) and no public transportation is available from New Orleans to those sites. A one-way taxi fare from downtown New Orleans to either the Barataria Preserve or to Chalmette Battlefield\/Chalmette National Cemetery costs about the equivalent of a one-day car rental. The paddlewheeler Creole Queen offers cruises to Chalmette Battlefield from New Orleans' French Quarter.",
