    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Operating Hours & Seasons              Operating Hours & Seasons      Mount Rainier National Park is open all year. Visitation is at its peak in July and August, when the weather is warm and dry and the wildflowers are blooming. If you are planning a summer trip to Mount Rainier, consider visiting mid-week, which is generally less crowded. Parking is limited in many areas of the park. Wait times at the Nisqually and White River Entrances can be up to an hour on the very busiest summer weekends and holidays. Entering the park before 10:00 am or after 2:30 pm can help avoid delays when visitation is heavy. Plan ahead and follow these tips to avoid summer traffic. In spring, with ephemeral waterfalls and in autumn, with brilliant colors reaching deep into the valleys, visitors can enjoy a more leisurely vacation in the park. During these seasons, weather may determine the availability of facilities in certain areas of the park. Before making any plans check the current status of roads, campgrounds, trails, and activities. Vehicle access to Mount Rainier in the winter is only available from the Nisqually Entrance, in the southwest corner of the park on the way to Paradise.  The Carbon River Entrance is open but the road within the park boundary is limited to foot and bicycle traffic. Check the road status webpage or at MountRainierNPS on Twitter prior to coming to the park as road conditions are subject to change (Twitter account not required to view).  Information and operating hours for visitor centers, wilderness information centers, campgrounds, picnic areas, lodging and food are located below.  Other important topics to consider when planning your trip are: road status, trail conditions, climbing permits, weather, and wilderness permits.          Last Updated: August 1, 2016 All scheduled opening dates are weather dependent.
