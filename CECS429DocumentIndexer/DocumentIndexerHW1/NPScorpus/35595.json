    "body": "The Art of Zion National Park         Watercolor by William Henry Jackson, 1937 Zion Museum Collection ZION 209   Dramatic landscapes have inspired great art around the world. The unique and awe-inspiring scenery of America’s national parks is no exception. In fact, national parks and great artists have always had a special relationship. Artists struggled to faithfully record unbelievable vistas and natural wonders. Their paintings in turn brought notice to these remarkable areas and inspired others to consider protecting them for generations to come. From the earliest days of Westward Expansion, artists joined explorers and scientists to document the “unknown” lands. Most American’s first notion that such places existed was from seeing a painting, either in person or reproduced in a magazine. The towering cliffs of Zion Canyon were so remote and inaccessible, that the nation was not introduced to this landscape until the turn of the twentieth century. One of the first paintings of Zion was by a veteran of John Wesley Powell’s second expedition of the Colorado River, Frederick S. Dellenbaugh. This early piece is held in the museum collection of Zion National Park. During the summer of 1903, Frederick S. Dellenbaugh visited Zion Canyon and completed a series of paintings. He also completed an article about Zion that appeared in a popular magazine. Through these mediums, Dellenbaugh transported this unknown canyon to visitors to the St. Louis World Fair and into the homes of Scribner’s Magazine readers over 100 years ago. Dellenbaugh’s images and words: “this great temple of eternity,” raised awareness about this majestic canyon and influenced some to petition for its protection as a national park.        \"Mountains of the Sun\" by Howard Russell Butler, 1926Zion Museum Collection ZION 14586   After the park was established, art pulled visitors to the canyon so that they might see its beauty first-hand. In 1926, the Union Pacific Railroad commissioned artist Howard Russell Butler to complete a series of landscapes to promote the scenic marvels of the Colorado Plateau. Butler’s wall-size paintings of Zion engulf the viewer and showcase the immense sandstone cliffs and narrow canyon walls. These paintings traveled the country and are now a part of the museum collection at Zion National Park. The Butler paintings represent the early period of the National Park Service promoting visitation of these new areas and developing better transportation to these parks in Utah. Today, Zion National Park is encouraging artists to create masterpieces. Zion National Park and the Zion Natural History Association recruit artists from the local community to produce, exhibit, and sell their art in the Zion Human History Museum. A variety of artists using a variety of mediums will rotate their work through the space throughout the season. Artist-in-Residence Program The Zion National Park Artist-in-Residence Program offers professional artists the opportunity to live and work in beautiful Zion Canyon. The works completed during this program contribute to the public understanding and appreciation of Zion National Park and reflect the National Park Service's commitment to the preservation of cultural and natural resources. Learn more about Zion’s Artist-in-Residence program.  Zion National Park Plein Air Art Invitation Celebrating the iconic artist Thomas Moran's place in the history of Zion Canyon, the Zion National Park Foundation will host the seventh annual Zion National Park Plein Air Art Invitational from November 2 to 8, 2015. The event will bring together 24 of the country's finest landscape artists to paint in the places Moran sketched in Zion Canyon. The artists will paint en plein air (in the open air) throughout the week at the same vantage points where Moran first made his Zion sketches. Park visitors that week will have many unique opportunities to witness these great artists at work in the park through daily demonstrations, lectures and activities.
