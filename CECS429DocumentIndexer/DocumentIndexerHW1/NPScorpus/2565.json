NPS\/Marge Ullmann  In November 2008 a major rehabilitation project was completed along Hermit Road that included widening the road to increase visitor safety, widening and improving the rim trail and constructing a new multi-use Greenway Trail, while maintaining the historic rural character of the roadway and protecting the park’s natural and cultural resources.  To learn more about the 2008 Hermit Road Rehabilitation Project go to  The Scenic and Historic Hermit Road. The project also included one of the largest vegetation restoration and rehabilitation efforts ever undertaken at Grand Canyon National Park. Restoration crews planted 20,000 plants and spread 200 pounds of native grass and shrub seed.   The vegetation work stabilized road shoulders, maintained the genetic integrity of plant species along Hermit Road, replanted impacted areas, and continues today with invasive species management and routine maintenance.
