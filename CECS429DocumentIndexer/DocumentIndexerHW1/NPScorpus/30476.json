This multi-purpose trail was developed by the National Park Service and is the major trail through Cuyahoga Valley National Park. From it you can make connections to many of the natural and historic sites in the park and to other trails that intersect it along the way.    History of the Ohio & Erie Towpath Trail The Towpath Trail follows the historic route of the Ohio & Erie Canal. Before the canal was built, Ohio was a sparsely settled wilderness where travel was difficult and getting crops to market was nearly impossible. The canal, built between 1825 and 1832, provided a successful transportation route from Cleveland, on Lake Erie, to Portsmouth, on the Ohio River. The canal opened up Ohio to the rest of the settled eastern United States. Download a copy of our Ohio & Erie Canal site bulletin.  The Towpath Trail Today Today you can walk or ride along the same path that the mules used to tow the canal boats loaded with goods and passengers. You can still see remnants of that former scene as you pass many of the canal locks and related structures. From the vantage point of the Towpath Trail you can also enjoy the beauty of forests, fields, and wetlands flanking the path as it winds its way through the Cuyahoga River Valley.  A visit to Canal Exploration Center, Boston Store Visitor Center, Peninsula Depot Visitor Center, or Hunt house can make your outing on the Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath Trail even more enjoyable. At these stops you can talk to a park ranger, see exhibits, and get information. The Towpath Trail is open 24 hours, giving you the chance to explore after dark. Within the national park, the trail is level and hard-packed for people using wheelchairs, bicycles, or strollers. The National Park Service does not plow the trail in the winter to permit cross-country skiing.  Please note: If you planning a multi-day Towpath Trail ride, please contact our Communications Center at 440-546-5945 to inform staff where you parked your vehicle. This will ensure our law enforcement rangers do not tag your vehicle as \"abandoned\".  To check for potential towpath trail closures, click here. From April through October, you can bicycle one way and return by train for $3 using Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad's Bike Aboard! service. Runners and hikers pay $9.
