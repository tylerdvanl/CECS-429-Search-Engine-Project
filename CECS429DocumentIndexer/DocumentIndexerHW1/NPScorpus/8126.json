    "body": "Glacier National Park Webcams       Our webcams are located throughout the park to provide views of the vast diversity of landscapes found in Glacier. While limited to locations that have power and access to the park's network, we continue to investigate new locations and new views.                      Goat Haunt The Waterton River joins Waterton Lake at the bottom of this view. Situated at the Goat Haunt Ranger Station this webcam provides a view north into Canada, and Waterton Lakes National Park. The International Boundary is about four miles up the lake. It is plainly visible from a boat or hiking the trail along the boundary, but only has significance to people. The animals in the park cross freely between the two countries and share the parks as one large habitat. Watch for the large cruise boat the \"International\" as it makes the trip up and back several times per day and occasionally wildlife on the sand bar at the mouth of the river.    View webcam                              Two Medicine Two Medicine was once a main hub of activity, particularly when most visitors arrived on horseback to stay at the Two Medicine Chalets. The former dining room of the Two Medicine Chalets is now the campstore. Two Medicine is still very popular but the vast majority of visitors to the park spend their time on the Going-to-the-Sun Road and miss this spectacular corner of the park.   View webcam                              Many Glacier There isn't a view much better than this. Swiftcurrent Lake provides the perfect setting to the mountains that loom in the distance. Dominating the view is Grinnell Point with Mount Gould to the left and Swiftcurrent Peak to the right. In between Grinnell Point and Mt. Gould is the cirque where Grinnell Glacier lies. One of the most popular hikes in the park is the trek to Grinnell Glacier. That trail typically opens in mid-July. Opening sooner are the hikes to Red Rock Falls, Iceberg Lake, Apikuni Falls, and Cracker Lake. Many Glacier is a hiker's paradise.    View webcam                              Apgar Lookout The summit of Apgar Mountain provides a spectacular view of Lake McDonald and the mountains in the distance.  To the left of the lake are Mt. Stanton and Mt. Vaught (Stanton just in front of Vaught) and then just to the right the Garden Wall. The Continental Divide follows the crest of the Garden Wall. Continuing to the right are Mt. Cannon and Mt. Brown. The last mountain clearly visible to the right is Mt. Edwards. Now that it is summer look for hikers in the foreground. Apgar Lookout is at the summit and one of the more popular hikes on the west side.

Sitting at the foot of Lake McDonald Apgar is a destination for boaters and campers. It's a great place to get prepared for your trip into the park.    View webcam                              Lake McDonald To many visitors to the park, this view is their first introduction to the spectacular scenery of Glacier National Park. This iconic view from Apgar, at the foot of Lake McDonald, really shows what Glacier is all about...big glacially carved lakes, vast wild views of the high peaks along the Continental Divide, and the ever-changing forests that blanket much of the lower elevations. It's no wonder that for many people when they think of Glacier, they think of this view.   View webcam                              Middle Fork of the Flathead River The Middle Fork of the Flathead River forms the southwest border of Glacier National Park. This view, from near Park Headquarters, shows the river as it flows under the West Glacier bridge. At night some of the lights of West Glacier may be visible. During the summer watch for rafters. Several commercial rafting businesses use this section of river. In the winter the only activity along the river might be the occasional coyote or deer or a really cold kayaker.   View webcam                              St. Mary Visitor Center This view from the St. Mary Visitor Center looks west to the mountains surrounding St. Mary Lake. Red Eagle Mountain looms directly in the center. In the winter and spring elk are often spotted in the meadow at first light. In summer wildflowers carpet the view. Fall sees the green turn to a golden hue which contrasts with the bright blue of the sky.    View webcam                              Park Headquarters This was the first webcam view that Glacier National Park offered. Originally it was only going to be a test until a better location was found, but it turns out that this view has a large following. This time of year you might see deer wandering around Park Headquarters and employees as they come and go to the office.    View webcam               NPS GRAPHIC             Is There a Problem? Sometimes our cameras stick on a date and time, due to some network issue or possibly a loss of power in that area. Generally we know about it and either need to wait for the power or network to come back, or we can possibly go to the camera to fix it. If you experience an issue with the cameras that you would like to report to us, please email us and let us know. Thanks for your help keeping the cameras going.",
