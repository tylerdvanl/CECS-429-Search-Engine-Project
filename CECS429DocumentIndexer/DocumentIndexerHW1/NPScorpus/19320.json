In addition, a one-mile round trip boardwalk trail is wheelchair accessible. Although most Indian mound groups involve hiking along relatively long and steep trails, three burial mounds are accessible directly behind the visitor center.           Yellow River Boardwalk Trail NPS Photo  Yellow River Boardwalk Trail For thousands of years, local American Indians were sustained by the bounty of the Mississippi and Yellow River wetlands. From beavers to arrowhead plants to the local clay, invaluable materials that were very much a part of ancient Iowans' everyday life were gathered from these wetlands. The Yellow River Bridge Trail (285 KB PDF) at Effigy Mounds National Monument, which is accessible to those with physical disabilities, allows visitors to explore the wetland environment. The walk over over recycled planks is approximately .5 of a mile long.  Birders will enjoy the neotropical migrants and resident nesting birds that are frequently found along the boardwalk. Turtles, frogs, muskrats and other four-legged animals are also found in abundance here.       Boardwalk Trail Wetland NPS Photo",
