    "body": "Dry Tortugas Visitor Boat Slips         Boat slips at Garden Key are now available for loading and unloading equipment and touring Fort Jefferson. NPS PHOTO  Construction has been completed on five visitor boat slips on Garden Key in Dry Tortugas National Park. These slips are a great addition for boaters who visit this remote park. Slip Usage Boaters can use the slips on a first come first service basis to unload camping gear and supplies or take a walking tour of the fort. As the harbor can be busy with many small private boats there is a two hour limit for slip usage. Boat permits Boat permits are required for all vessels in the park with the exception of those transiting across park waters. These are free and can be acquired from park rangers on site or contact VHF Marine Radio Channel 16.
