    "body": "Curriculum Materials       The teacher team, made up of seven teachers, one principal, and nine Bighorn Canyon employees, developed the curriculum to help teachers share the wonders of Bighorn Canyon with their students. It is our hope that the teacher guide can be used by teachers in the local area as well as teachers around the nation.  A teacher supplemental disc has also been developed. It has character essays, handouts, and photos that can be used to enhance many of the activities in the teacher guide. If you are interested in having one sent to you, please call Christy Fleming at 307-548-5406.
