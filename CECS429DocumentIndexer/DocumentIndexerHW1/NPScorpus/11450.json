Among these items are artifacts dating back to San Francisco's gold rush days, as well as more recent items from the twentieth century, fine art, tools and equipment used in maritime endeavors, the personal effects of sailors and passengers, and parts of historic vessels. Access to the Park's stored museum artifact and stored small craft collection is currently unavailable as we move these collections to a new facility. The archival collections continue to be available via appointment. If you are in need of research assistance during this time, please contact us. We thank you for your cooperation and understanding.",
