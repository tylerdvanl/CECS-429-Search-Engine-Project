It is a broad, short volcanic crater formed by groundwater or permafrost coming into contact with hot lava or magma, which causes an explosion powerful enough to create a large hole in the ground. This hole eventually fills with rain water to create a lake. The maars of Bering Land Bridge National Preserve are quite unique. They are at the northernmost point in the world where maar lakes can be found and they are the largest in the world. They were the first reported example of maars created by permafrost contacting magma.",
