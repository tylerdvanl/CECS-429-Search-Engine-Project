Whether you take a boat tour or kayak in a remote fjord, you will be surrounded by pristine scenery and abundant wildlife. A hike to the top of the Harding Icefield Trail or scenic overflight gives you a window to past ice ages.    At Exit Glacier you can stroll the trails, take a ranger-led walk, and get close enough to hear the creaks and groans of an active glacier as it slowly sculpts the landscape.    Although much of the park is rugged wilderness, there are ways to explore for all interests and abilities.  In fact, there are at least 99 ways to #FindYourPark in Kenai Fjords National Park!",
