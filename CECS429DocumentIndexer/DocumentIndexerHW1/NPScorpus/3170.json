The goal of the Weed Free Trail program is to hike Saguaro National Park's trail network while eradicating non-native, invasive plants that threaten the native ecosystem. Volunteer Weed Free Trail monitors will hike and examine trail segments a minimum of three times per year, independently and on a very flexible schedule.  Weed Free Trails is a great way to get involved with Saguaro NP and learn a variety of skills such as:   Plant Identification GPS navigation and waypoint creation Outreach Cultural site recognition Park radio communication Safe hiking principles        Orientations are held periodically. Feel free to email SAGU_Invasive@nps.gov or call (520)733-5187 with any questions regarding Saguaro National Park's Weed Free Trails Program. WFT Flyer",
