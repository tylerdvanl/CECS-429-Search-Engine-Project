    "body": "Bromide Springs & Pavilion       In the mid-1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps built a new stone pavilion to improve access to Bromide Springs. Designed in a rustic style, the pavilion included stone fountains that dispensed bromide, sulphur, and medicine waters. Tanks stored water from low-flow springs and supplied water during periods of heavy daytime use. By the 1980s, the flow from the mineral springs and well to Bromide Pavilion diminished and eliminated the availability of water at the pavilion. For over fifty years the pavilion has been a gathering place for music, revivals, and special events.",
