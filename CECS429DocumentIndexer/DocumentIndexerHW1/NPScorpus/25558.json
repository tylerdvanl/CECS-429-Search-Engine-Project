Some were poor, some were professional; some wives joined their husbands and other women left their husbands at home. When the San Francisco newspaper of 1897 reported - \"Sacks of gold from mines of the Klondike,\" gold fever swept the land. Many stories told of how men and women had worked on their own for less than a year to bring out great riches. Many people were faced with the economic depression of the time, and the idea of finding treasure and sacks of gold filled up everyone's imagination.  A few women came from desperation to support themselves and families; others sought out adventure and excitement from their boring routine life. Among the mix were miners, business women, journalists, shopkeepers, cooks, nuns, entertainers, teachers, physicians and hotel proprietors. Some came to see what the Klondike Fever was all about. Everyone was hoping to improve their fortunes if they could. These women faced no ordinary circumstances. Most stampeders, male or female, were not physically conditioned to the strenuous life that was required. Some died along the way, and others turned back.   These are just a few stories from women in the gold rush   Kate Carmack - part of the group that first discovered gold Annie Hall Strong - used her experience to provide advice for other women going north Mollie Walsh - a young business owner whose story ends in tragedy Harriet Pullen - arrived to the muddy mess of Skagway in 1897, eventually owned the best hotel in town         Learn more!

Visitors will soon have the opportunity to understand more about the hardships and successes of gold rush women.       Kate Carmack The first woman of the Klondike was Kate Carmack. Native Tagish, Kate was one of eight children born into an arranged marriage between the coastal Tlingit people and the Tagish to formalize trading partnerships. When her first husband and a child died, her mother encouraged Kate to marry her deceased sister's husband, George Carmack. She was the among the first to hear the news when husband George, and her brother Skookum Jim discovered the gold on Bonanza Creek that started the big rush in 1897. Like other early Klondike women, she did very well in the beginning. Kate and George worked their rich mining claim for 2 seasons. In their cabin, Kate kept house, cared for their daughter and took in laundry. She sewed moccasins and warm winter clothing to sell to other miners and helped provide meals for her family by picking berries and trapping rabbits and ptarmigan.  In the fall of 1898, they decided to go to Seattle to celebrate their riches. The Carmacks planned to buy a yacht to sail to Paris with their millions. But within a year, George and Kate's marriage fell apart. A divorce followed the next year based on George's infidelity and desertion. Kate was among other Native wives who found themselves discarded when their prospector husbands left the North Country. George claimed that he & Kate had never been married. He later married another woman and lured Kate's daughter Gracie to Seattle. Kate lived out the rest of her life in Carcross, Yukon Territory, sadden by the loss of her daughter and supported by a government pension. She died in 1920, and never received her share of any mining riches. Return to the top       Annie Hall Strong In the Skagway News, December 31, 1897 Annie Hall Strong wrote advice to women who \"have made up their minds to go to the Klondike.\" Ms. Strong weighed in on the required ton of supplies and wrote \"what should be taken & what should be left behind- from a woman's perspective.\" She said,  \"There is no use trying to discourage them, our wills are strong and courage unfailing. There are a few things a woman should carefully consider before starting out on this really perilous journey. Delicate women have no right attempting the trip. It means utter collapse. Those who love luxury, comfort and ease would better remain at home. It takes strong, healthy, courageous women to stand the terrible hardships that must necessarily be endured. \"    Among her \"Advice to Women\", Ms. Strong recommended 3 canvas bags: 1 for bedding, 1 for clothing, and 1 for shoes and boots. From her actual first-hand experience, Ms.Strong says: Evaporated eggs are a failure and everyone who took saccharin as a substitute for sugar were loud in their condemnation of it. Take plenty of sugar. One craves it, and 200 pounds per outfit is not too much. Corn meal, sugar, tea and coffee should be packed in tins. Take plenty of tea. Baking powder and candles are apt to be the first articles to disappear. A few extra pounds would come in very handy. She also recommended lemonade tablets; they are preferable to lime juice and citric acid, being easier to carry, having no weight or bulk.  As for sleeping bags, \"several people have been disappointed in them. A piece of heavy canvas 5 X 14 will take the place of the heavy ready- made sleeping bag. …in a blizzard without your tent, you can stretch your canvas over a pole and make a tent at a moment's notice.\" Beds on the trail were also substituted with a good pioneer mattress, called a \"tick\" and filled with dried moss.

Von Halle  Mollie Walsh Unlike the established trade route of the Chilkoot Trail, used by Native Tlingit's, the White Pass Trail was less steep. This trail became a wagon road on more solid ground and attracted pack animals and horse traffic. The lucrative freight and passenger White Pass trail supported businesses and services for stampeders on their way to Lake Bennett. One of the bright little businesses located about 30 miles from Skagway was owned by Mollie Walsh. Mollie Walsh arrived with friends in Skagway in 1897 and got a job in a restaurant. A year later, she bought supplies, hired a packer to transport them beyond the Canadian border where she opened up a primitive \"grub tent\" café for freighters. She served basic meals to freighters passing through and gained a reputation for her home cooked meals served up with cheerfulness.  When the railroad replaced the freighters and stampeders going over the White Pass Trail, Mollie moved to Dawson, opened a restaurant and married Mike Bartlett. Bartlett had been only one of her suitors;her other suitor was known as Packer Jack Newman. Mollie and her husband Bartlett enjoyed prosperity from his packing business and the couple re-located to Seattle. After several travels and various endeavors, the Bartlett's marriage ended a few years later when Mollie left him with another man, John Lynch. She took Bartlett's money and their 13 month-old son. Bartlett pursued the couple and in March 1902, forced reconciliation with Mollie in Seattle. The marriage again turned bad and Mollie had her husband arrested due to drunkenness and abusive threats against her life. A few days later, she withdrew her complaint which was a grave mistake. Bartlett chased her down an alley and shot her in the back. Mollie died. After a lengthy trial, Bartlett was acquitted of murder by reason of insanity.  Mollie's gold rush suitor, Packer Jack Newman, had remained in love with her. He commissioned a stature of her in Skagway which stands today with the following inscription:   Alone and with help, this courageous girl ran a grub tent near Log Cabin during the Gold Rush of 1897-1898. She fed and lodged the wildest gold-crazed men. Generations shall surely know this inspiring spirit. Murdered October 27, 1902.

Harriet arrived in Skagway with early fortune seekers in the fall of 1897, and started out like many others, broke, but optimistic and ambitious. Of her arrival, she said   \"I only had seven dollars to my name. I didn't know a soul in Alaska. I had no place to go. So I stood on the beach in the rain, while tented Skagway of 1897 shouted, cursed, and surged about me.\"    She gained employment cooking for Captain William Moore, a man of means and wealth, and supplemented her income by selling her apple pies. Harriet's successful pie business led quickly to bigger enterprises. She sent for her horses from Washington state and geared up to haul freight for miners over the rugged White Pass Trail, also known as the Dead Horse Trail. She made enough to support herself and three children. Profits from this venture helped her make a smooth yet big transition in her life; when the White Pass & Yukon route railroad was completed, this closed down freight lines.  Harriet joined the thriving business of tourism. She purchased a grand home from Captain Moore, which she then converted into one of Alaska's most luxurious hotels. Harriet gained a hospitable reputation for her accommodations which boasted hot baths and soft beds. Guests staying at her Pullen House mansion enjoyed fresh vegetables picked from her gardens along with milk and cream from her farm in Dyea. Harriet also provided dramatic presentations in the parlor of Pullen House, drawing on her personal stories and experiences with Skagway's colorful cast of gold rush characters and events.  Harriet became affectionately known as \"Ma Pullen\" with respectful notoriety, sharing her hospitality with visitors in her vibrant hotel until she died in 1947.
