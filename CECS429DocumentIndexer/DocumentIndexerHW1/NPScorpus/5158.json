The McDade Recreational Trail, a packed gravel path, parallels the Delaware River on the Pennsylvania side of the park for 32 miles and most is perfect for mountain and hybrid bikes (closed to biking between White Pines and Pittman Orchard trailheads). Motorized vehicles are not permitted on the McDade Recreational Trail. Visit the McDade Recreational Trail page for detailed trail information. For those who enjoy road biking, Old Mine Road parallels the Delaware River on the New Jersey side for 34 miles in the park. Visit the Scenic Drive page for detailed information about this route. Road biking on US 209 in Pennsylvania is not recommended due to heavy traffic. Road biking on River Road in Pennsylvania is strongly discouraged due to sharp, steep turns, blind curves, and the lack of shoulders.
