This fissure eruption covered the portion of the Chain of Craters Road that created this stop. By being adventurous, you can walk around and view several lava tree molds and a big cinder field that was created during this lava flow. Prior to this eruption, this area was a dense forest. A beautiful view of Mauna Ulu can be seen from this pullout. Taking photos from this vantage point is well worth the effort.          Distance From the Beginning of Chain of Craters Road Distance From Kīlauea Visitor Center    Stop #1Lua Manu Crater 0.5 mi \/ 0.8 km 3.8 mi \/ 6.1 km    Stop #2Hilina Pali Road 2.3 mi \/ 3.7 km 5.6 mi \/ 9.0 km    Stop #3Pauahi Crater 3.3 mi \/ 5.3 km 6.6 mi \/ 10.6 km    Stop #4Mauna Ulu 3.7 mi \/ 6.0 km 7.0 mi \/ 11.3 km    Stop #5Mauna Ulu Flow Across Chain of Craters Road 4.1 mi \/ 6.6 km 7.4 mi \/ 11.9 km    Stop #6Mau Loa o Mauna Ulu 6.4 mi \/ 10.3 km 9.7 mi \/ 15.6 km    Stop #7Kealakomo Overlook 9.9 mo \/ 15.9 km 13.2 mi \/ 21.2 km    Stop #8Pu‘u Loa Petroglyphs  16.3 mi \/ 26.2 km 19.6 mi \/ 31.5 km    Stop #9Hōlei Sea Arch  18.8 mi \/ 30.3 km 22.1 mi \/ 35.6 km    Stop #10End of Chain of Craters Road  18.8 mi \/ 30.3 km 22.1 mi \/ 35.6 km          Return to: Drive Chain of Craters Road - main page Things to Do",
