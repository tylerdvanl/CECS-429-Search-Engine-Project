Visiting Operating Hours and Seasons to see what facilities are open in winter and Temporary Closures to check on current weather, road, and facility updates.          Cross-Country Skiing and Snowshoeing       Are you looking for current ski conditions? Check out the grooming status at Friends of Acadia's Winter Trails Association.           Forty-five miles (72 km) of carriage roads in the park offer the perfect setting for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. Ski tracks are sometimes laid down by volunteers on sections of the carriage roads when snowfall exceeds four inches (10 cm); nearly 32 miles (51 km) are designated for grooming when conditions and time permit. For the grooming status of these areas see the table below. The Carriage Road User's Map can help you find your way on the carriage roads.  You may also cross-country ski on unplowed park roads. Be careful, as snowmobiles are permitted to use most of these unplowed park roads. Skiing on hiking trails is not recommended because of the uneven and steep nature of trails, ice falls blocking the path, and trail routes obscurred by snow. Please do not snowshoe or allow dogs to walk in cross-country ski tracks. Ski equipment and rentals are available in local communities. Grooming Click here for a map of grooming routes. Some areas may not be groomed. The list below is accurate to the best of our knowledge; conditions may change between the time the routes are groomed and information is posted. You can help keep this list current; if you are out skiing and notice that conditions are different from what is listed here, please contact us.         Scenic Drives       Although most of Park Loop Road is closed in winter, two sections remain open, Oean Drive and Jordan Pond Road.
