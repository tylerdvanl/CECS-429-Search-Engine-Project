David Ek\/NPS Photograph  Native plants are an important part of any ecosystem-- they provide habitat and food sources for native wildlife. Within the park, there are 813 native species of plants. While many homeowners choose non-native plants for their gardens, we strive to use species that naturally occur in this region. Many examples of native plants in landscaping settings can be seen throughout the park- the parking lots at Johnson Ferry North and Paces Mill have recently been restored with native species, as has an area in front of the park headquarters at Island Ford.
