A cultural landscapes is a geographic area, including both cultural and natural resources and the wildlife or domestic animals therein, associated with an historic event, activity, or person, or exhibiting other cultural or aesthetic values. Cultural landscapes have been recognized by the National Park Service as cultural resources since 1983, and our responsibilities for their preservation are equal to historic buildings, museum collections, and archeological resources.  There are two cultural landscapes that have been documented in the park. The 400-acre Kalaupapa and Kalawao Settlements cultural landscape contains all the resources associated with the Hansen's disease settlements. In contrast, the 23-acre Molokai Light Station cultural landscape is a smaller parcel of land associated with the construction and development of the lighthouse and lighthouse keeper's quarters. Cultural Landscapes Inventories (CLIs) have been completed for both landscapes, and a third native Hawaiian cultural landscape has been identified, but has not been researched.
