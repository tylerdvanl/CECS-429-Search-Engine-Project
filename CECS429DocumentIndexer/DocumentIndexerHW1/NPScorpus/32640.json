On April 7th, 2015, the National Park Service (NPS) issued a prospectus for solicitation of offers for a 15-year concession contract to provide Lodging, Camping, Food and Beverage, Retail, Equipment Rental and Other Services at the Cinnamon Bay and Trunk Bay areas within Virgin Island National Park.    The business opportunity provides interested parties a range of hospitality services in this well-known national park and has the potential to touch the lives of over half a million recreational visitors on an annual basis. These operations include overnight experiences on the world famous Cinnamon Bay Beach either at the charming and rustic cottages or in pre-set up eco tents. Under this opportunity, the Concessioner will also provide food, beverage and retail services at Trunk Bay where the beach and underwater snorkeling trail provide a breathtaking National Park experience for thousands visiting St. John.    As of early September 2015 a NPS review panel evaluated the bids received on the principle and secondary selection factors laid out in the prospectus as advertised on April 7, 2015. The review panel consisted of NPS personnel with expertise in areas related to the selection factors and with experience in the evaluation process. The group is advised on legal issues by an attorney from the Department of Interior Solicitors Office throughout the review process. The panel recommendation is being readied for review by the Solicitors Office and will be forwarded to the National Park Service Regional Director, Southeast Region.Once approved at this level it is sent to the Chief Financial Officer of the National Park Service for approval. Once approved, the selected party must sign and execute a contract. Since this contract will be for 15 years, the Service is required by regulation to submit it to both the U.S. House of Representatives (Committee on Resources) and the U.S. Senate (Committee on Energy and Natural Resources). This review takes 60 days and must be completed before the final award can take place. We anticipate having the operator of the new contact in place by early summer of 2016.

All prospect applicants are encouraged to read it.  The majority of the commercial activities authorized by the Commercial Services Plan begin and terminate outside the park and are subject to commercial use authorization (CUA). The CUA is a mechanism to authorize and monitor those commercial uses and activities for which concession contracts are not appropriate. Key aspects of the CUA process at VINP include: --Permits are issued on a calendar year basis, beginning January 1 and ending December31st. Partial year authorizations are not generally available --Each commercial use of park land or waters requires an individual CUA. Business operating more than one service must obtain a permit for each commercial activity. -- To provide for a market competition, a limitation of three CUAs per business is established. --Pursuant to the Cost Recovery Act (16 USC 3a) and NPS policy, all CUAs are subject to a fee based upon recovery of NPS application, administration and monitoring costs.
