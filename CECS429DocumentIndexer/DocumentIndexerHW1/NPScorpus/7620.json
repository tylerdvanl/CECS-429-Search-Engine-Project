Why not stop by and see us on your way to either one of these parks. The Big Hole valley is also home to part of the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest. This 3.35 million area is the site to many year round outdoor recreational opportunities. Interested in Montana History? The first territorial capital of Montana is located 58 miles from the park. Bannack State Park is a great ghost town to visit. For ranching history Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site is located in Deerlodge less than 75 miles from the battlefield. This site is a well preserved working late 1800's ranch and is well worth visiting.",
