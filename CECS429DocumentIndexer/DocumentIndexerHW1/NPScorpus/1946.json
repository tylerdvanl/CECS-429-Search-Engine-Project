We take this responsibility seriously and want to make sure that we are doing what is necessary to protect parks for future generations. So, scientists and managers across the country are creating State of the Park Reports to evaluate and communicate park conditions in a clear and simple way. Here at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, our report provides: ″ a snapshot of the status and trend in the condition of the park's most important resources and values ″ a summary of complex scientific, scholarly, and park operations information ″ highlights of our stewardship activities and accomplishments ″ key issues and challenges facing park managers We will use this report to guide decisions and priorities in the future.
