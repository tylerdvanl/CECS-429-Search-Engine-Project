    "body": "Flat Ranger         Flat Stefine made it to the top of the Cape Lookout lighthouse (that's 207 steps!).  From there, she had a bird's eye view of South Core Banks, one of the islands in the park.   Flat Stanley by Jeff Brown is the story of a boy who is flattened by a bulletin board. Because he is flat, he can travel by mail (which costs a lot less than traveling by plane or car). Like Flat Stanley, Flat Rangers travel across the country by mail. They visit America's National Parks and send home pictures and information about all the places they see. Send your Flat Ranger to Cape Lookout National Seashore for a guided tour of the park, starting at the Harkers Island Visitor Center. Your Flat Ranger might look for seashells, take a boat ride, or search for wild animals.
