Just for fun, for a map showing the most current ozone data where you live, you can click on this page from the Environmental Protection Agency during ozone season (May - September.)   Activity 6 What is acid rain? Acid rain comes from polluted clouds. Exhaust from factories and automobiles produce chemicals that collect in clouds and mix with water vapor. When it falls to earth, it comes in the form of acid rain, acid snow, or even acid dew. Too much acid in the polluted clouds can kill plants, fish, and animals that depend on it. Wind can blow the polluted clouds hundreds of miles, so we are unable to control where the acid precipitation will fall. We can walk or ride bicycles instead of riding in our cars, on our motorcycles and all terrain vehicles. Next time you're going somewhere nearby, ask your parents or guardians if you may walk instead. To find out if rain is acid, it is measured on a pH meter and is given a number from 0 - 14. The lower the number, the more acid it is. The opposite of acid is base. Normal rain has a pH of 5.0 - 5.6. The pH of cola is 4, and lemon juice is 2. Because of the weather patterns in this part of Cherokee County, South Carolina, Cowpens National Battlefield gets acid rain from industries, vehicles, and many other sources both nearby and far away. The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control has an acid rain monitoring station at Cowpens National Battlefield. The acid rain reading at the park is usually around 4.5. Draw a chart showing the usual acid rain reading for Cowpens National Battlefield.   Activity 7  Circle the letter of the correct answer.
