    "body": "Bromide Hill        View from the Bromide Hill overlook, 1960s. NPS\/Chickasaw National Recreation Area   Â    This nearly vertical wooded bluff rises 140 feet above its base along Rock Creek. Along its top is found one of the most obvious ecotones in the area, where a growth of dense oak, ash and elm vanishes and short grass and prickly-pear cactus become predominat. One can see for several miles in all directions from the Bromide Overlook, a vantage point from which the various natural landscapes of the park can be seen from a different perspective, as well as the Arbuckle Mountains and the Washita River valley on the southwest. Local legend holds that this location was once used by early-day outlaws, hence it is also known as Robbers' Roost.",
