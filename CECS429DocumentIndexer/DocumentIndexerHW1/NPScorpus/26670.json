Results of genetic tests on Mazama and Rough-skinned Newts.  The blue X's are newts found outside of Crater Lake while the other colors\/symbols represent the genetics of newts found inside of Crater Lake.  Since the groups have little overlap, the data indicate the newts are different geneticaly NPS  Newt genetic tests reveal Mazama Newts (graph symbols within green line) are genetically different than the common Rough-skinned Newts (X symbols within black line).   Why are the genetic results significant? The National Park Service has a responsibility to protect the native plants and animals within Crater Lake National Park boundaries, especially those found nowhere else.",
