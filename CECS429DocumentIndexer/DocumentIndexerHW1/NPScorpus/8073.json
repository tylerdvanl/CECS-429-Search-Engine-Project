Once the headquarters of a 10 million acre cattle empire, Grant-Kohrs Ranch is a working cattle ranch that preserves these symbols and commemorates the role of cattlemen in American history.        NPS  Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument In 1876, 263 soldiers and attached personnel of the U.S. Army, including Lt. Col. George A. Custer, met death at the hands of several thousand Lakota and Cheyenne warriors in one of the last armed efforts of the Northern Plains Indians in their struggle to preserve their way of life.        NPS   Waterton Lakes National Park Rugged, windswept mountains rise abruptly out of gentle prairie grassland in spectacular Waterton Lakes National Park. Here, several different ecological regions meet and interact in a landscape shaped by wind, fire, flooding, and abundant plants and wildlife. The park helps to protect the unique and unusually diverse physical, biological and cultural resources found here.      Active Partners Rocky Mountain Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Unit (CESU) The Rocky Mountain CESU has provided seed money for CCRLC projects and is an important partner in identifying researchers that can address park needs. National Park Service Research Learning Center Network (RLC) Research Learning Centers have been developed to promote research and scientific understanding and provide educational opportunities in our national parks. They are places where science and education come together to preserve and protect areas of national significance. The CCRLC partners with other RLCs on a variety of projects. Glacier National Park Conservancy The Conservancy helps to support Glacier National Park's educational, interpretive, cultural and scientific programming needs. They have provided funding for CCRLC educational materials and programs and are major supporters of the Glacier National Park Citizen Science Program. Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center (Glacier Field Station) US Geological Survey (USGS) The USGS scientists stationed in Glacier National Park are key CCRLC partners. They provide resource information, research data, and act as subject matter experts for many CCRLC media and educational products. Rocky Mountain Inventory & Monitoring Network (ROMN) ROMN is one of 32 vital signs monitoring networks across the National Park Serivce (NPS). Its purpose it to work with six NPS units within the Rocky Mountain region to provide scientifically credible, long-term ecological information for natural resource protection and management. This is accomplished by inventorying natural resources and monitoring vital signs of ecosystem health in each NPS unit and sharing that information within the network, the Intermountain Region, and larger I&M Program. Glacier Institute The Glacier Institute is a non-profit organization that provides hands-on, field-based educational adventures in Glacier National Park and the Flathead National Forest for both adults and youth. The Glacier Institute is an essential partner of our annual teacher workshop. Flathead Community of Resource Educators (CORE) Flathead CORE is a network of individuals and organizations working together to increase awareness and understanding about the natural, historical and cultural resources of the Flathead Region. The Montana Loon Society The CCRLC partners with the Montana Loon Society and the Montana Common Loon Working Group, providing loon data collected through our Citizen Science Program. In addition, we work with both the Montana Loon Society and the Biodiversity Research Institute to mentor a student \"Loon Ranger\" from the Blackfeet Community College. The Loon Ranger surveys lakes on the neighboring Blackfeet Reservation for loons and loon habitat. National Center for Appropriate Technology (NCAT) Energy Corps AmeriCorps Energy Corps AmeriCorps members provide hands-on energy assistance, energy education, and community energy strategic planning and development activities. Glacier National Park, though a partnership between the CCRLC and NCAT, is currently working with an Energy Corps member to create a five-year sustainability plan for the park. Environmental Protection Agency Climate Friendly Parks Program Washington, DC This partnership combines the EPA's global change educational activities with the National Park Service's sustainability efforts.
