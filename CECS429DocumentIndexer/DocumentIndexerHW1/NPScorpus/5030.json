Eastern National operates our bookstore and it donates all proceeds from sales to support park partners. Our Artist-In-Residence Program brings artists into the park to share their vision of the park and help others to establish their own personal relationship with the park. Many photographers donate photographs to share their vision of the natural splendor this park has to offer. There are also many opportunities to volunteer with park partners or through our Friends Group.",
