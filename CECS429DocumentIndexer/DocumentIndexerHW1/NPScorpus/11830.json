USGS\/Gary Nafis  The California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii) was once a common species found in Southern California. Nowadays, there are only three small populations of red-legged frogs in all of Los Angeles County, with only one population of red-legged frogs remaining within the park boundary and surrounding area. The population of red-legged frogs in the Santa Monica Mountains and Simi Hills is critically small and isolated, and there is great concern about the long-term persistence of the existing population.  Â      California Red-legged Frog USGS\/Gary Nafis  Park biologists are working with partners in re-introducing red-legged frogs into suitable stream habitats on NPS and state lands within the Santa Monica Mountains. Re-establishment of new populations would prevent extirpation from the park, in the case of a catastrophic event.",
