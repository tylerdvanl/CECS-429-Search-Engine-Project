He captured dozens of moments of camp life on grainy, black and white film: raising the flag, building a bridge, and just plain ol' goofing around. Shelia generously donated scans of the photos, as well as some original prints, for the park to share with researchers and visitors. Enjoy this glimpse into Arches' past.
