    "body": "Addition Lands General Management Plan       BACKGROUND The Big Cypress National Preserve was set aside in 1974, to ensure the preservation, conservation, and protection of the natural scenic, floral and faunal, and recreational values of the Big Cypress Watershed. The importance of this watershed to Everglades National Park was a major consideration for its establishment.   In 1988, Big Cypress National Preserve was expanded by about 146,000 acres with the passage of the Big Cypress National Preserve Addition Act (Public Law (PL) 100-301). The Addition consists of about 128,000 acres northeast of the original preserve boundary and approximately 18,000 acres along the western boundary. The following documents relate to a General Management Plan (GMP) completed in 2011 that will guide the National Park Service's management of the Addition Lands in the future.
