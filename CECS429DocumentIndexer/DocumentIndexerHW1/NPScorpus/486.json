He got up at five every morning to practice the piano, which he studied twice a week until he was fifteen. Truman understood that you never stop learning. Today, children ages 5-12 can participate in our Junior Ranger program. After visiting the site and completing several Truman-related activities, children are sworn in as official Junior Rangers and receive a badge. You can also become a Web Ranger!
