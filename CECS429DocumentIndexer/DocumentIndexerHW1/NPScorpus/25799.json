    "body": "Caving         Great Basin National Park offers wild caving by permit to those with the necessary skills NPS PHOTO  Wild Caves Lehman Caves is the most famous of Great Basin National Park's caves, but there are actually more than 40 caves in the park.  One of these wild caves is accessible with a cave permit.  All other wild caves are closed to the public.    White-Nose Syndrome (WNS) is a fungal disease that has killed more than 1 million bats in the U.S. and Canada. WNS is named for the white fungus that grows around infected bat's faces and other body parts. It was first documented in the winter of 2006-2007 in upstate New York and has since spread as far west as Oklahoma and as far south as North Carolina. White-nose syndrome has been linked to the fungus Geomyces destructans and results in bats exhibiting abnormal behavior during winter months such as flying during the day and clustering near entrances. In some hibernacula (caves or mines where bats spend the winter) 90 to 100 percent of the bats have died. This epidemic has been called one of the greatest wildlife disasters in our nation's history.  Bats make up over 20% of the mammal species on Earth and save the U.S. agricultural industry over 3 billion dollars a year in pest-control services.  One wild cave, Little Muddy, will remain open each winter from October 1st to April 1st for those who can demonstrate cave conservation ethics, experience caving, and certify that their equipment is clean and disinfected. As new information about both WNS and Geomyces destructans comes to light, Great Basin National Park will be implementing new decontamination and monitoring procedures, as well as other required guidance, as it becomes available. The park has also committed to reviewing the entire White-Nose Syndrome Response Plan, including cave closures, in three years time. Please work with us to protect our bats and their habitat. You can find out more at the U.S. Geologic Survey National Wildlife Health Center website www.nwhc.usgs.gov\/ or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service website www.fws.gov\/WhiteNoseSyndrome\/.
