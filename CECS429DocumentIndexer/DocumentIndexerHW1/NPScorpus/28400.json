Special Programs Our daily programs are designed to give visitors to the park the basic story of the American Revolution, the Constitutional Convention and Benjamin Franklin's life, but there's a lot more to the story of the founding of the United States that cannot be covered in one tour. If you feel inspired to learn more than the basic history, we regularly hold in-depth special programs on a variety of subjects that may include 18th century life, the creation of the U.S. Constitution, African American history, Native American history and Women's history just to name a few.
