The South Rim Shuttle Bus System  The National Park Service has provided free shuttle bus service on the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park for more than 40 years. All of the park's buses are fully accessible and run on compressed natural gas, which means fewer harmful emissions for people and the environment. And the roadways are far less crowded!  Grand Canyon's shuttle system provides a hassle free way to access South Rim trails, viewpoints, and other points of interest –some areas are only accessible by bus. The shuttle system is not an experience in and of itself, but a means to access all that the South Rim has to offer –hiking;cycling;scenic views and artistic endeavors;historical structures inspired by the regional landscape;and museums and information centers that highlight the park's unique cultural and natural resources.
