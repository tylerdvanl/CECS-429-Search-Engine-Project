    "body": "Pets                   Activities with pets are very limited at Big Cypress. Pets are not allowed on any hiking trails. Pets may accompany visitors in the campgrounds, picnic areas and at pullouts along the paved scenic drives. Pets may be walked on roads or in parking lots, but must be leashed at all times when outside a vehicle. Pets may not be left unattended. Important! Car temperatures rise quickly in the sun, even on cool days. Your pet can easily die of heat exhaustion. If you are leaving a pet in a car, crack the windows as much as possible and leave water to drink. We recommend you not leave pets in the car at all when temperatures are above 68 degrees, even with the windows cracked.   td>",
