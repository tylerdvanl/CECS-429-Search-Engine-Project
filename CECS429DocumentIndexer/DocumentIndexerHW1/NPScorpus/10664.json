    "body": "CCEM - Reports and Publications         CACO wildlife ecologist Bob Cook braves snags and frigid temperatures to measure water depth in a vernal pond. Measuring physical and environmental characteristics of vernal pond habitats is an important component of the amphibian monitoring program at CACO. NPS photo  Reports and Publications The Cape Cod National Seashore (CACO) has ambitious research goals. Together the Atlantic Research & Learning Center and the Cape Cod Ecosystem Monitoring (CCEM) program compose a strong network of research facilitation and information exchange that integrates natural and cultural resource data into management planning and decision making. One end product of these efforts are written reports and publications. Below, please find a listing of reports and publications, organized by ecosystem type, that characterize research taking place at the park. This list is composed of both NPS reports and publications as well as journal articles and theses that give accounts of research done in direct collaboration with the park.  Most NPS reports are viewable as word documents or pdfs. Journal articles and theses are linked to abstracts where available. All publications that utilize data made possible by the Inventory and Monitoring Program have been highlighted with an asterik (*). Click on the highlighted links to view or download these files. The reports are grouped into the following ecosystem types:      Estuaries and Salt Marshes Beaches, Spits, Barrier Islands and Shorebirds Ponds and Freshwater Wetlands Coastal Uplands Park-Wide \/ Multi-System             Flowering Spartina alterniflora in a Cape Cod salt marsh. Photo By Jane Barnes   Estuaries and Salt Marshes - top of page Estuaries and salt marshes are ecologically and economically important systems. Estuaries and salt marshes are some of the the most biologically productive ecosystems in the world serving as a source of nutrients for many coastal food chains as well as habitat and feeding grounds for an array of important species. Like many coastal areas in the United States, the land use history pertaining to estuaries and salt marshes on Cape Cod has proven destructive. In past centuries much of the intertidal acreage on Cape Cod has been restricted or drained as what were once common means of mosquito control. Due in large part to this fact, salt marsh restoration is a major focus of current management and research at Cape Cod National Seashore.      Hatches Harbor Restoration Annual Reports - Hatches Harbor is a 200-acre salt marsh that was bisected in 1930 by a dike originally built to reduce population levels of nuisance mosquitoes. In 1996, the National Park Service, in cooperation with the Provincetown Airport Commission, Provincetown Municipal Airport and the Federal Aviation Administration, agreed to restore the degraded habitat. A comprehensive environmental monitoring program was begun in 1997. The main goal of the monitoring program is to document the pace of restoration...More Info     Stephen M.

An oxygen depletion and fish kill in September 2001 prompted Truro and Cape Cod National Seashore officials to open the clapper valves in the 4-ft diameter drainage pipe connecting the southeast end of the system with Cape Cod Bay in hopes of restoring some tidal exchange and increasing aeration. Despite limits on tidal exchange imposed by the pipe's small diameter, and the distance that it travels under ground, we have observed an impressive response in the recovery of salinity and estuarine biota...More Info Smith, S.M., K.C.

NPS photo   Beaches, Spits, Barrier Islands, and Shorebirds - top of page There are no shortage of sandy habitats on Cape Cod. These environs host a number of rare plants and animals. Shorebirds, like the piping plover, are a particularly charismatic group of species that often attract much attention. For over two decades an enormous, nation-wide effort has been waged to protect the piping plovers from imminent extinction. As a result, plover populations continue to grow closer to stability. Cape Cod National Seashore beaches serve as prime breeding habitat for piping plovers. An intensive monitoring and management program at CACO has contributed significantly to the plovers' ascendance from the brink.      Annual Shorebird Monitoring and Management Reports - Cape Cod National Seashore provides miles of prime feeding, nesting and roosting habitat for beach-nesting birds, including the federally threatened piping plover.  These reports summarize the results of the shorebird monitoring and management program at CACO...More Info   Shorebird Monitoring and Management at Cape Cod National Seashore - 2014 Shorebird Monitoring and Management at Cape Cod National Seashore - 2013  Shorebird Monitoring and Management at Cape Cod National Seashore - 2012 Shorebird Monitoring and Management at Cape Cod National Seashore - 2011 Shorebird Monitoring and Management at Cape Cod National Seashore - 2010 Shorebird Monitoring and Management at Cape Cod National Seashore - 2009 Shorebird Monitoring and Management at Cape Cod National Seashore - 2008 Shorebird Monitoring and Management at Cape Cod National Seashore - 2007 Shorebird Monitoring and Management at Cape Cod National Seashore - 2006 Shorebird Monitoring and Management at Cape Cod National Seashore - 2005 Shorebird Monitoring and Management at Cape Cod National Seashore - 2004 Shorebird Monitoring and Management at Cape Cod National Seashore - 2003 Shorebird Monitoring and Management at Cape Cod National Seashore - 2002 Shorebird Monitoring and Management at Cape Cod National Seashore - 2001 Shorebird Monitoring and Management at Cape Cod National Seashore - 2000 Breeding Ecology of Piping Plovers Nesting at Cape Cod National Seashore - 1999 Breeding Ecology of Piping Plovers Nesting at Cape Cod National Seashore - 1997  Breeding Ecology of Piping Plovers Nesting at Cape Cod National Seashore - 1996 Breeding Ecology of Piping Plovers Nesting at Cape Cod National Seashore - 1995 Breeding Ecology of Piping Plovers Nesting at Cape Cod National Seashore - 1994 Breeding Ecology of Piping Plovers Nesting at Cape Cod National Seashore - 1993         Besides serving as recreational destinations for people, kettle ponds throughout Cape Cod National Seashore serve as important habitat for a variety of wildlife. NPS Photo   Ponds and Freshwater Wetlands - top of page Kettle ponds are ecosystems that for many people represent the Cape Cod experience. These freshwater ponds, remnants of retreating glaciation, are unique in many ways. Kettle ponds rely almost solely on ground water as a freshwater source, making them highly vulnerable to environmental disturbance. Atmospheric deposition and recreation have a direct effect on the ecological processes of these ponds, making careful management essential. In addition to Kettle Ponds, Cape Cod National Seashore hosts hundreds if not thousands of freshwater wetlands, ranging greatly in size and composition, but all of which serve as critical habitat for a multitude of species.      Pond Breeding Amphibian Monitoring Reports- Cape Cod National Seashore supports a great abundance and diversity of freshwater wetlands. Few landscapes in the region contain such a wealth of wetlands, which in turn support many regionally uncommon species of wetland-dependent flora and fauna. Among these, amphibians play a significant role in the energy flow, biomass, and community structure of freshwater wetlands, and contribute significantly to terrestrial ecosystems as well. Consequently, monitoring of pond breeding amphibians was initiated in 2003. Specific rationale for the program includes concerns for individual habitats and species, as well as questions related to changes in abundance, distribution, and structure of the park's amphibian communities...More Info     2005 Monitoring of Pond Breeding Amphibians at Cape Cod National Seashore*    2004 Monitoring of Pond Breeding Amphibians at Cape Cod National Seashore*    2003 Monitoring of Pond Breeding Amphibians at Cape Cod National Seashore*      Additional NPS Reports and Publications on Ponds and Freshwater Wetlands       Cook, R.P., K.M.

The effects of atmospheric deposition, rising sea-levels, ground-water withdrawal, and environmental contaminants are all examples of variables with wide-ranging implications.
