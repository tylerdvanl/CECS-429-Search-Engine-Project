    "body": "Electronic Field Trip           Sea Change: Gulf Islands National Seashore   The National Park Service and National Park Foundation developed an Electronic Field Trip (EFT), titled \"Sea Change: Gulf Islands National Seashore\" that was shown on March 1, 2011. This EFT looked at the science of understanding change as seen daily on the barrier islands of the Gulf Islands National Seashore and in how the recent Gulf Oil Spill has impaced species and critical habitat.  A companion website for the upcoming EFT has already launced at www.electronicfieldtrip.org\/gulfislands. Visitors to the site will find lesson plans for classroom use and interactive games for youth. Games on the site feature turtles that help youth find the various forms that spilled oil has taken in the Gulf of Mexico waters, determine whether certain impacts in the Gulf are due to natural or human causes, and navigate through a food chain from the level of a diatom to a shark! This show is targeted toward students in grades 4th through 8th, but all ages are encouraged to take the electronic field trip.",
