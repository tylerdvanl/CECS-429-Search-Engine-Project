    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Things To Know Before You Come             Things To Know Before You Come       The Lyndon Baines Johnson Memorial Grove on the Potomac is administered by the George Washington Memorial Parkway. Check out Laws & Policies for a complete list of rules. Lodging There is no camping available at the park. Where To Eat Meals and snacks are available at the Columbia Island Marina. Trash There are no trash cans in the park. Plan to take your trash with you when you leave. Pets You may bring your pet with you to the park. With the exception of service animals, pets are not permitted on ranger-led programs. At all times, pets must be restrained on a leash no longer than six feet in length. Leashes protect dogs from becoming lost and from other hazards, such as sick, injured, or rabid animals. Leashes also help protect park resources, including wildlife and vegetation. Pet owners are responsible for picking up pet waste and disposing of it at home. Pets should not be left unattended. Summer sunshine poses a threat to pets left in vehicles. On a bright, sunny day, even in temperatures as low as 60Â° F, temperatures inside a vehicle can reach dangerous levels. On an 85-degree day, the temperature inside a car-even with the windows cracked-can reach over 100 degrees within 10 minutes. Your Safety Choose clothing appropriate for the weather and activity you have chosen and bring enough water. Occasionally water fountains and restrooms may not work. Check for ticks, as Lyme disease can occur in this area. Consider wearing long pants and using insect repellent. Poison ivy is found throughout the park. Learn to identify and avoid it. For your safety and the safety of park wildlife, don't feed the animals. Animals that have been fed may come to expect food from humans. This might lead them to approach people who will hurt them, get hit by a car while hanging out near people, or get sick from eating the wrong food. Do not leave valuables in a parked car. Place them out of sight before arriving at your destination or carry them with you during your visit.",
