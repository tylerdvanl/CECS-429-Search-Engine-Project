    "body": "Park Profile and Fact Sheet          Park Profile and Fact Sheet Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park is dedicated to preservation, commemoration, and interpretation of the resources associated with the birth and early years of our 16th President and the efforts of the Lincoln Farm Association and others in establishing a lasting tribute to Abraham Lincoln.   The park contains two units located within ten miles of each other. The Birthplace Unit represents Lincoln's humble beginnings with a symbolic cabin enshrined within a neo-classic Memorial Building. The Boyhood Home Unit at Knob Creek was home to Lincoln during his formative years. Lincoln's experiences as a young boy growing up in Kentucky helped mold him into the man who became the nation's 16th President. Abraham Lincoln Birthplace Unit   The Birthplace Unit features 116 acres of the Lincoln family's Sinking Spring Farm. An early 19th century Kentucky cabin symbolizes the one in which Abraham Lincoln was born. The cabin is enshrined inside the Memorial Building at the site of his birth. The Birthplace Unit also includes the Sinking Spring, the site of the Boundary Oak tree, and the park's Visitor Center with exhibits and a film that is shown on the hour and half hour.   Boyhood Home Unit at Knob Creek   \"My earliest recollection is of the Knob Creek place,\" wrote Abraham Lincoln on June 4, 1860. The Lincoln family lived on 30 rented acres of the Knob Creek Farm from the time Abraham was two until he was seven years old when the family left for Indiana. While serving as President, he recalled planting pumpkin seeds in the fields in every other hill and in every other row while others were planting corn. The following day a big rain in the hills flooded the creek and washed away their crops.   Establishment of the Park   Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park was established by the Lincoln Farm Association in the early 1900s. The site was donated to the federal government and became a national park on July 17, 1916. At that time it was called the Abraham Lincoln National Park. The Boyhood Home Unit at Knob Creek was established November 6, 2001, and is administrated by the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park. The site was formerly owned by the Howard family and operated as a tourist attraction from 1931 until 2001. In 2001 the site was purchased by the Preservation of Lincoln's Kentucky Heritage Inc. and donated to the National Park Service.
