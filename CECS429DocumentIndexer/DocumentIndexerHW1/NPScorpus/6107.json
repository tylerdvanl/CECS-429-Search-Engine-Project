    "body": "Explore This Park    Learn About the Park     History & Culture             History & Culture       Wright Brothers National Memorial commemorates two ingenious brothers from Dayton, Ohio who chose in 1900 the sparsely populated area known as the Outer Banks to conduct a series of experiments that three years later resulted in the world’s first heavier than air, powered controlled flight. The story of these brothers embodies the American ideal of hard work overcoming all obstacles. Wilbur and Orville Wright were not just lucky bicycle mechanics. They succeeded because of study and scientific experimentation. Their story is the realization of a dream that had existed for centuries. Their story is not simply about building the first plane, but rather about how they scientifically solved the problems of powered flight. It is a story about those who inspired—and those who aided—the brothers, as well as the coastal area of North Carolina before, during, and after the dream came to life.",
