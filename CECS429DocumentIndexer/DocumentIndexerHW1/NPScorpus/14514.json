    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit           Plan Your Visit      Plan Your Visit  The life of Abraham Lincoln was greatly influenced by religion.  Many of his speeches and presidential documents contained religious and biblical references and overtones.  Begin your journey at the Visitor Center and view the Bible that belonged to his father and mother, Thomas and Nancy Lincoln.  This book proved to be very influential on the child, the boy, and the man.  View the 15 minute captioned orientation film of Lincoln's early years in Kentucky.  Examine the exhibit hall to follow the Lincoln family's migration in America and to gain an insight into frontier cabin life. While on park grounds stop to see the Sinking Spring from which the farm received its name and where Abraham got his first drinks of water.  Walk up the 56 granite steps (one step for each year of Lincoln's life) or follow the accessible \"Pathway of a President\" boardwalk to the Memorial Building housing the symbolic cabin on the location where Abraham Lincoln was born. Follow the trail of the Lincoln family to Knob Creek which furnished Abraham Lincoln his \"earliest recollections.\"  Walk the fields where a young Lincoln worked and played, then stroll down to the creek that nearly claimed his life. Inquire at the Birthplace Unit's information desk for assistance with accessibility needs.",
