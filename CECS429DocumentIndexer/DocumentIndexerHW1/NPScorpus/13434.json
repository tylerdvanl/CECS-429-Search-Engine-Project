There are several ways of supporting the park:           The National Park Service Volunteers-In-Parks Program (VIP) was authorized by Public Law 91-357 enacted 1970. The primary purpose of the VIP program is to provide a vehicle through which the National Park Service can accept and utilize voluntary help and services from the public. The major objective of the program is to utilize this voluntary help in such a way that is mutually beneficial to the National Park Service and the volunteer. Volunteers are accepted from the public without regard to race, creed, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, or disability.           Parks may accept donations from individuals, families, organizations, foundations, corporations, businesses, associations and other entities. Your contribution will be used to enhance visitor services and support resource protection and programs throughout the park.  No other federal agency relies as heavily on the generosity and kindness of its visitors, and we thank you for your past support and look forward to future cooperation.           Eastern National it the park’s cooperation association, managing the park stores, providing educational items for visitors. They are a 501(c)3 non-profit cooperating association, operating in more than 150 national parks and other public trusts. They are dedicated to the preservation and use of the parks for the benefit of all Americans, visitors from all nations and future generations.         To donate to any of your national parks, you can contact the National Park Foundation. www.nationalparks.org",
