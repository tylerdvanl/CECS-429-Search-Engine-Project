The park considers \"off-trail travel\" any travel that occurs in areas that are not a designated trail, maintained by the park and illustrated on the park map.  In previous years, off-trail travel was prohibited under the conditions of the Commercial Use Authorization (CUA), but it was still occurring with frequency by some groups. For the 2014 calendar year, off-trail travel by commercial groups is allowed while the park explores alternatives that allow for appropriate use while remaining compliant with the park's Wilderness Management Plan.  A public meeting on this topic will be held on August 12, 2014 at 6:30 PM at Beaver Meadows Visitor Center. We invite you to attend this meeting to provide your input. If you are unable to attend, please provide input via this form.  The form will be available for responses until Sunday, August 17, 2014 at 11:59 PM MDT.  Commercial Guided Climbing Review and Stakeholder Input Form Rocky Mountain National Park staff are currently undergoing a review and analysis of contracting practices and policies regarding commercial guided climbing at the park. This summer, an updated commercial services strategy for guided climbing is being developed and park staff are seeking stakeholder input.  The goals of this comment form are to help staff better understand the demand for guided climbing services at the park and find opportunities to meet the needs of visitors and the guided climbing community. This form will be available for comment submission through July 28, 2014 11:59 PM MDT.  Thank you in advance for your input.  Highway 7 Recreation Improvements Plan Rocky Mountain National Park, in cooperation with the Arapaho & Roosevelt National Forest, is preparing a management plan for the Highway 7 Corridor near Estes Park, Colorado. Highway 7 runs along the east side of Rocky Mountain National Park and also provides access to lands administered by the U.S. Forest Service. The plan will focus on three key locations: Lily Lake, the Longs Peak trailhead, and the Meeker Park Campground. The purpose of the plan is to identify future visitor services and facilities that may be needed at the three locations. The National Park Service and the U.S. Forest Service will jointly prepare the Higway 7 Corridor Management Plan and an accompanying Environmental Assessment. Final Elk and Vegetation Management Plan\/Final Environmental Impact Statement Research reveals that elk numbers in and around Rocky Mountain National Park are high and outside the natural range of variability. High elk numbers on the winter range are having an adverse impact on plant communities, particularly aspen and willow. The Elk and Vegetation Management Plan examines alternatives for managing the elk population and restoring vegetation communities to their natural range of variability to the extent possible. Greenback Cutthroat Trout Management Plan Environmental Assessment (EA) The National Park Service is examining ways to continue to manage the native Greenback cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias) and control nonnative fish that hinder its survival east of the Continental Divide in Rocky Mountain National Park. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Eastern brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and Brown trout (Salmo trutta) are invasive nonnative species that have displaced the Greenback cutthroat trout throughout much of its native range. The Greenback cutthroat trout is listed as a threatened species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service under the provisions of the Endangered Species Act. The National Park Service (NPS) is considering four alternatives for managing Greenback cutthroat trout (GBC). In August 2006, new information was received regarding the distribution of the greenback cutthroat trout in the park. Genetic information has revealed that some populations that were previously classified as pure greenback cutthroat trout are not so. The accurate distribution and purity of greenback cutthroat trout in the park must be known before we can make informed management decisions. In light of this new development the Greenback Cutthroat Trout Management Plan and EA has been postponed until the park can determine the accurate distribution and purity of populations that may be affected by management actions.
