These include:  Fees collected at Elliott and Boca Chita Keys for camping and overnight docking Grants and donations received through the South Florida National Parks Trust Grants from outside sources like the Captain Bob Lewis Boat Center Yamaha Billfish Challenge and the State of Florida's sea turtle license plate program  In addition to the money used to operate the park and its programs, park visitors have an economic impact on the surrounding community. In 2003, the National Park Service and Michigan State University issued a report entitled Impacts of Visitor Spending on Local Economy: Biscayne National Park 2001. The report concluded that the park's nearly half-million visitors that year contributed nearly $22 million to the local economy and supported 290 jobs. Read the full report here.",
