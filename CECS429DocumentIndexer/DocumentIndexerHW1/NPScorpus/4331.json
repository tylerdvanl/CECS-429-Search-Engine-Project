    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility             Accessibility       For All Visitors Since most of the park is covered by water, access to anything beyond the mainland shoreline requires a boat. On the Mainland The Dante Fascell Visitor Center and Park Headquarters are located at Convoy Point, and ramps, elevators and boardwalks make these areas fully accessible to those with mobility challenges. Exhibits inside the Visitor Center are bilingual English\/Spanish, as are the wayside exhibits along the Jetty Trail. Haitian Creole translations for the wayside exhibits are available at the Visitor Center information desk. Audiovisual programs are closed-captioned and available in both English and Spanish. Translations of the Park's brochure are available in Spanish, French, German and Japanese. The park's Junior Ranger Program Books are available in English, Spanish and Haitian Creole. On the Islands On Boca Chita Key, Elliott Key and Adams Key, restrooms are accessible, but some of the buildings are not. There are no sidewalks on Elliott Key or Adams Key, but Boca Chita Key does have sidewalks around the harbor and to the restrooms, but the remainder of the island is lawn and rocky ground.",
