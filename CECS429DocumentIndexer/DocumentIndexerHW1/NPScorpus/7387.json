    "body": "Bighorn Canyon In Your Classroom       Bighorn Canyon Education Programs In Your Classroom! Bighorn Canyon offers southern Montana and northern Wyoming schools the opportunity to have a ranger visit their classroom for an in school program. The visit consists of a program entitled “How Far Would You Go!“ This is an interactive Powerpoint presentation. The program concerns the life and legacy of Grosvener W. Barry, how he promoted Hillsboro, Montana (which is preserved as a ghost town in the park), and his Cedarvale dude ranch. In 1913, Barry led a group of fellow adventurers down the Bighorn Canyon, all the way to New Orleans, on a two cylinder, eight horsepower boat named the Edith . That’s right, a two cylinder, eight horsepower boat, from Montana all the way down to the Gulf of Mexico. Can you imagine? Barry could and he ended up using his imagination to make reality. This program interprets Hillsboro, the Edith’s voyage and Barry’s ensuing success at the ranch. It asks students to consider:  What Barry and Hillsboro may mean to them? What can they learn from this story?  What does it mean to take action and expand your horizons?   This program meets the state of Montana education curriculum standards and can be geared towards elementary or middle school students. To schedule a ranger visit to your class contact us or call Chief of Interpretation Christy Fleming at 307-548-5402.",
