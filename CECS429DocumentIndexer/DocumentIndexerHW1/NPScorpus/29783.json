    "body": "Liberty Island Chronology          Early History A.D. 994 Native Americans begin to inhabit the land that is now Liberty Island. This island is one of the three \"Oyster Islands\" in New York Harbor, for the numerous shell beds in this location and a major source of food. 1609 Henry Hudson lands in New York Harbor and the Hudson River estuary. Europeans begin to colonize the area which includes the Oyster Islands. Occupation, war, and disease during colonization force the Native Americans to move both north and west. 1667 Isaac Bedloe, a Dutch colonist, obtains a colonial land grant for this Oyster Island. 1669 Colonial Governor Francis Lovelace confirms Bedloe's ownership of the island on the condition that it is renamed Love Island. 1673 Bedloe dies, Governor Lovelace is overthrown by the Dutch navy, and Love Island is renamed Bedloe's Island. 1674 The English take over Bedloe's Island. 1732 Mary Bedloe Smith (Isaac's widow) sells Bedloe's Island to Adolph Philipse and Henry Lane, New York merchants, to get out of bankruptcy. 1738 New York City takes possession of the island, using it as a quarantine station, inspecting incoming ships for contamination and disease. 1746 Archibald Kennedy (later 11th Earl of Cassiles) purchases the island and establishes a summer residence. 1755-1757 Bedloe's Island is reestablished as a quarantine station due to the outbreak of smallpox. 1758 Ownership of Bedloe's Island is again granted to New York City. 1759-1760 A hospital is constructed on Bedloe's Island. 1772-1776 During the American Revolution, the island is used as an asylum for Tory sympathizers (American colonists loyal to Great Britain during the war). 1776 Colonial insurgents lay siege Bedloe's Island and burn its buildings. 1784 The New York state legislature passes an act once again making the island a quarantine station. 1793-1796 The French (allies of the Patriots during the war) use Bedloe's Island as an isolation station. 1794 After the events of the American Revolution, and the rising tensions between the United States, England, and France, federal dollars are appropriated to construct fortifications on Bedloe's Island. 1807 The United States Army administers Bedloe's Island as a military post until 1937. Construction on the \"Works on Bedloe's Island,\" later known as Fort Wood, begins. The 11-point star fort aids in the protection of the New York Harbor.  It is garrisoned with artillery and infantry until the outbreak of the Civil War. 1811 The \"Works on Bedloe's Island\" is completed. 1814 The \"Works on Bedloe's Island,\" is renamed Fort Wood by New York Governor Daniel D. Tompkins in the memory of Eleazer D. Wood, an army hero killed in action at Fort Erie. 1834 An interstate agreement between New York and New Jersey places Bedloe's Island (the land above low level water mark) within New York while New Jersey retains riparian rights to waters and all submerged land surrounding the island. 1861 The United States Civil War begins and Fort Wood serves as a recruiting station and ordinance depot.  A small garrison is maintained at the fort. 1877 The garrison at Fort Wood is disbanded. However, the United States Army continues to supervise an ordnance post (and remains active) on Bedloe's Island until 1937. Bedloe's Island is designated as the site for the Statue of Liberty.        Bartholdi in his studio, Vavin Street, Paris, 1892 National park service, statue of liberty NM  The Origins of the Statue of Liberty The Statue of Liberty is more than a monument; she is a beloved friend and living symbol of freedom to millions of people worldwide. 1865 Edouard de Laboulaye, a French political intellectual and authority on the U.S. Constitution, proposes that France give a statue representing liberty to the United States for its centennial.  The recent Union victory in the American Civil War reaffirms the United States' ideals of freedom and democracy, serving as a platform for Laboulaye to argue that honoring the United States would strengthen the cause for democracy in France. 1870 Auguste Bartholdi, a young sculptor fascinated with the idea of creating colossal works, enthusiastically supports Laboulaye's proposed statue and becomes the sculptor of the Statue of Liberty. 1871 Bartholdi comes to the United States to promote the Statue and scout out possible sites. In his travels, Bartholdi discusses the project with politicians and publishers. 1872 Bartholdi returns to France and reports on having found interest in the project as well as the perfect site - Bedloe's Island located in New York Harbor.         Bartholdi and workmen constructing a final wood-and-plaster model of the Statue’s left hand. Bartholdi is thought to be below the Statue’s arm on the left hand side. National Park Service, Statue of Liberty NM  The Statue in France The Statue of Liberty's construction holds great significance, for it is a tapestry of old symbols woven together to create new meaning. Her classical face and drapery suggest a Roman Goddess of Liberty; the broken shackles symbolize freedom newly achieved; the radiant crown represents her shedding light on the seven seas and continents. The tablet she holds, inscribed in Roman Numerals \"July 4, 1776,\" identifies the figure as an apostle of American freedom, law and justice. - Statue of Liberty Exhibit Text 1875 Bartholdi's plaster model of the Statue, referred to as \"The Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World,\" is approved by Laboulaye. Laboulaye makes a formal request to President Ulysses S. Grant for using Bedloe's Island as the Statue's official site. The Franco-American Union is formed in France to oversee fundraising for the Statue. The Statue of Liberty's creators strongly feel that the project should be a joint French-American effort: the French agree to fund the Statue if the people of the United States fund the pedestal. Between 1875 and 1880, the French committee raises about 400,000 francs. 1876 Bartholdi begins constructing the Statue. Bartholdi completes the Statue's hand holding the torch. This section of the Statue is sent to the United States and displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia on May 18th. 1877 After being part of the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, the Statue's torch is displayed at Madison Square in New York City. It remains there until 1882. February 22nd - The U.S. Congress accepts the Statue of Liberty as a gift from the people of France. March 3rd - President Ulysses S. Grant signs a bill designating Bedloe's Island as the Statue's site. The United States begins fundraising for the construction of the pedestal through the American Committee for the Statue of Liberty, which is chaired by William Maxwell Evarts. Bartholdi's friend Richard Butler is also heavily involved. The committee raises $125,000 between 1877 and 1884. 1878 The Statue's head and shoulders are completed and displayed for the first time at the Paris Universal Exposition. 1879 The Statue's engineer, Eugene Viollet-le-Duc, dies and Bartholdi hires Alexandre-Gustave Eiffel to complete the project and overcome various obstacles concerning the Statue's structure and assembly. The obstacles include the Statue's height, weight, unusual shape, and the high winds in New York harbor. 1880 Eiffel devises his ingenious support system: a 98 foot (29.87 meters) inner iron framework that will support the Statue's structure. 1881 The Statue's copper plates are completed and the first rivet is driven into the structure. This begins the Statue's assembly and completion. As the Statue is gradually built near the Parc Monceau, in Paris, the French people fall in love with her. She is referred to as the \"Lady of the Park.\" The American Committee for the Statue of Liberty commissions American architect Richard Morris Hunt to design the pedestal; within months he submits a detailed plan. 1883 The Statue's assembly continues in Paris and work begins on the 15 foot deep foundation for the pedestal on Bedloe's Island. General Charles P. Stone is appointed as Chief Engineer, responsible for design and construction of the concrete foundation and the construction of the pedestal. Edouard de Laboulaye dies. November 2nd - Emma Lazarus composes \"The New Colossus\" for the \"Art Loan Fund Exhibition in Aid of the Bartholdi Pedestal Fund for the Statue of Liberty\" - a fundraiser for the pedestal. 1884 Hunt completes his finalized plan for the pedestal, with poured concrete walls up to 20 feet thick, faced with granite blocks. The concrete mass is the largest mass of poured concrete at that time. The pedestal's cornerstone is laid on Bedloe's Island. July 4th - hundreds of people gather at the feet of the completed Statue in Paris to watch as she is formally presented to Levi P. Morton, the U.S. minister to France. A crisis occurs in the United States. The Statue is scheduled to arrive in the United States in 1885, but funds for the pedestal project run out and work on the pedestal stops. 1885 New York World publisher, Joseph Pulitzer, comes to the Statue's financial rescue with a highly successful, six-month fund raising campaign. Over $100,000 is raised. The Statue is disassembled in Paris and shipped to the United States aboard the French navy ship the Isère. It arrives in New York Harbor on June 17th. The Statue is met with tremendous fanfare and a naval parade, but is placed in storage for a year while the pedestal is completed.        The Statue of Liberty enlightening the New York Harbor in 1886.

King of New York to begin construction work on the Statue. This begins the difficult and dangerous task of reassembling the Statue on Bedloe's Island. The crews, most of whom are immigrants, assemble the Statue with great precision and speed. The decision is made to light the Statue's torch electrically.
