    "body": "Laws & Policies       Denali's enabling legislation is the starting point for understanding the purpose of the park. Any park unit's enabling legislation outlines the specific reason(s) why Congress designated the place a national park (or national preserve, etc).    Regulations There are a variety of rules and regulations that dictate how the park must be managed. These regulations help us protect park resources while also providing visitors with a safe and enjoyable experience.    The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and the Superintendent's Compendium provide a complete listing of park rules and regulations. 36 CFR parts 1-199 pertain to all National Park areas. 36 CFR part 13 pertains to all Alaska National Park areas.  The Superintendent's Compendium is reviewed annually and provides a list of regulations under the discretionary authority of the superintendent. Generally speaking, Alaska State laws dictate who may possess firearms within the park. A variety of additional information can be found in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), the full text of which is available on the Library of Congress website.    Management Plans A variety of management plans inform and direct the day-to-day decisions of park managers. Various plans, like Denali's General Management Plan, Backcountry Management Plan, and others, live in the park's planning portfolio.
