NPS Photo  Langston Watras (pictured left) has been an art teacher for the Dayton Public School District for over ten years and one year at Trotwood-Madison School District. He has also worked at photography studios and galleries. During his time as a Teacher-Ranger-Teacher (TRT), here at Dayton Aviation Heritage NHP, Langston's duties included those as an interpretive ranger and instructing children and adults about the Wright brothers' accomplishments & Paul Laurence Dunbar's writings.   \"As a Dayton resident and Dayton Public School employee, I believe that it is vital to the city's future that we educate our children about the great developments that have taken place here. If we can get our children to become excited about the people and events in Dayton's history, then we may help them visualize a better future,\" remarked Langston.     x x x   TRT Lesson Plans    You can download the complete and full file of lesson plans (10 lesson plans) from Langston here or you can download them individually in the Curriculum Materials section.
