The park proposes an increase to the Memorial Column entrance fee. The current entrance fee of $3.00 has been in place since 1997.  In 2007 PEVI postponed a scheduled fee increase to $5.00. This postponement was due to the memorial being closed for restoration. In order to stay on track with the fee schedule, PEVI proposes an increase in the amount of $7.00 per person for visitors 16 years and older.
