Both Glacier National Park and Waterton Lakes National Park, across the border in Canada, were designated International Biosphere Reserves and together were recognized in 1995 as a World Heritage Site.               Animals   Lions and eagles and bears. Oh my.        Plants   Glacier hosts many plants and plant-like organisms.            Dynamic Environment  The park is named for its prominent glacier-carved terrain and remnant glaciers descended from the ice ages of 10,000 years past. Bedrock and deposited materials exposed by receding glaciers tell a story of ancient seas, geologic faults and uplifting, and the movement of giant slabs of the earth's ancient crust overlaying younger strata. The result of these combined forces is some of the most spectacular scenery on the planet (and a hiker's paradise).               Environmental Factors   Air, earth, wind, water.         Natural Features & Ecosystems   Get behind the scenery.        Wildland Fire   Fire is a part of the park's natural lifecycle.",
