Whether it's along the bayou at Jean Lafitte's Barataria Preserve or somewhere else, there's a National Park Service area out there that's just for you.      Fees: No admission fees. Donations accepted at visitor centers. All programs and events are open to the general public. All programs and events are free unless noted otherwise. Passes: None of the passes listed below are currently offered at any Jean Lafitte sites. Follow the link for information on how and where to obtain these passes.    America the Beautiful National Parks and Federal Recreation Lands Pass   Senior Pass (for US citizens 62 and older;available by mail)   free Access Pass (for permanently disabled US citizens; available by mail)   free annual pass for active duty military and dependents    Every Kid in a Park pass: Every fourth-grader in the United States is eligible to get a free pass to America's public lands, including National Park Service areas. Go to the Every Kid in a Park webpage, follow the directions, and get a paper voucher with a unique serial number. Take the voucher to a federal public lands site that charges an admission fee and trade the voucher for a pass good for admission for the fourth-grader and up to three adults accompanying them. Kids can use their pass as many times as they want and the pass is good through August 2016.   Jean Lafitte does not have the passes to trade for vouchers since Jean Lafitte does not charge admission, but any federal public lands area that charges admission does have the passes.   Kids in ungraded schools and home schoolers can get vouchers if they'll be 10 during this school year.   Educators like teachers, youth group leaders, scout leaders, etc., can get vouchers for fourth-graders in their groups through the website too!     Permits: Permits are required for some special events, commercial filming and photography, hunting, research, and other activities. More information is available on the permits page. Reservations: Most park programs do not require reservations; reservation requirements are noted on program descriptions whenever they are needed. Group programs and special accomodations require reservations. Check with the site that you want to visit to make reservations for a group or to discuss special needs.",
