Kids, you can earn an Aztec Ruins Junior Ranger patch by completing Junior Ranger activities online! You will learn about the daily lives of ancestral Pueblo people, the food they ate, their music, their artwork, the Great Kiva at Aztec Ruins, and how we preserve the site today. Once you watch four videos and do four activities, have a parent help you fill out the address form, and we will mail your patch. Classrooms are welcome to do the Junior Ranger program; unfortunately we can't send patches for large groups, but we'll send your class Junior Ranger stickers! The program is designed for elementary school-aged students. Good luck!  Â      Ranger working with kids in a free Junior Ranger Camp during the summer of 2012.
