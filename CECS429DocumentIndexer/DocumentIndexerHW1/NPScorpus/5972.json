Some reptiles prefer moist floodplains and shaded forests, while others are well suited for open grassland and agricultural fields. The juxtaposition of different habitat types is important for these cold-blooded creatures because they must move between shady and sunny spots to regulate their body temperature. While hiking along the parkâ€™s trails be sure to watch for our many snakes, turtles, lizards and skinks. While nearly all of our reptile species are harmless there have been sightings of the Northern Copperhead, which is a venomous snake species. The copperhead is most easily identified by its copper-colored head, as well as tan and brown bands along its body.",
