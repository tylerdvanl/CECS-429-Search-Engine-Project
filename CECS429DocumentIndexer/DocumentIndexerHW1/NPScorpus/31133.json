    "body": "Visiting the Johnson Settlement        Volunteers in 1860s clothing stand on the porch of the cabin that belonged to Sam and Eliza Johnson, the President's grandparents.        Lyndon Johnson's grandfather and great-uncle established a cattle droving headquarters in the 1860s on land that is now part of Johnson City, Texas. Their log cabin and subsequent barns, cooler house, and windmill still stand. There is also a modern exhibit center focusing on the cattle business, early Johnson family and settlement history, and Hill Country survival. A chuckwagon and longhorn cattle round out the \"cowboy\" atmosphere.         How to Get There To reach the Settlement, take a self-guiding nature trail from the Visitor Center. The easy round-trip trail is less than a mile long. For those traveling west on Highway 290 from Johnson City towards the LBJ Ranch, there is also a marked pullout where visitors may park their cars and walk into the Settlement.",
