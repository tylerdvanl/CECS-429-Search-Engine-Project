    "body": "Swimming       Although there are no designated swimming beaches at Curecanti, on a hot summer day a dip in Blue Mesa Reservoir can be refreshing and enjoyable. Water temperatures are always cold. Surface temperatures average about 65 degrees Farenheit in the summer, and get even colder as you go deeper. The shoreline of the reservoir is steep and rocky in most places, so finding a good swimming spot can be more difficult than you may expect. Good spots include:  Bay of Chickens (Windsurf Beach), 1.2 miles west of Elk Creek Dry Creek, 1 mile east of Elk Creek Old Highway 50 beach, adjacent to the Elk Creek Campground  The above locations have designated \"no wake\" areas for motorboat traffic. It is illegal to jump off rock cliffs, ledges, bridges or man-made structures from 15 feet or more above the surface of the water within Curecanti. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS  Swimmers must be aware of boats and personal watercraft. Do not assume they see you. Be aware of the symptoms of hypothermia, which can be brought on by exposure to cold water.",
