The speed limit is 15 miles per hour and is strictly enforced. Most of the area available from the Tour Road is designated a commemorative area with recreational activities prohibited except exploration by foot. 557 Creek warriors and 49 U.S. soldiers died on this ground, making it a solemn experience. Hiking     A 2.8 mile long nature trail winds its way around the Battlefield and near Tohopeka Village, the site of a Creek Indian camp in the early 1800s. Those using the trail should wear comfortable walking shoes, a hat, a jacket, and sunscreen. Bring water and a snack. The trail is mildly rigorous. Picnicking    Horseshoe Bend NMP offers two picnic areas. The larger is located near the Visitor Center and includes two covered shelters. The smaller offers uncovered picnic tables near the Miller Bridge Boat Ramp on Highway 49. Picnicking is not permitted on the battlefield or in Tohopeka Village site. Tables and shelters are available on a first come, first served basis only. Boating  Over 15,000 people launch vessels at the Miller Bridge Boat Ramp each year to explore the winding Tallapoosa River. Primarily used by canoeists, the area near this boat ramp is extremely rocky with depths and currents dependent on adjacent Lake Martin.  Information is available on canoe routes and access points. Camping is not permitted along the Tallapoosa River within the park. Fishing   Shorefishing is allowed at the Miller Bridge Boat Ramp only. An Alabama State Fishing License is required. Click here for more information on the Tallapoosa River and river levels Bicycling    Bicycling is permitted on the 3 mile paved Tour Road. Cycling is not permitted on the nature trail, the Battlefield, Tohopeka Village, or any cross country locations. Bike racks are provided at the Visitor Center. Children under the age of 16 should be accompanied by a responsible adult when cycling in the park. Horseback Riding    Horseback riding is not permitted on the battlefield or in Tohopeka Village. Check at the information desk for the status of unpaved access roads in the park. Hunting and Trapping   Neither activity is permitted within Horseshoe Bend NMP. All park resources – plants, animals, relics, and artifacts – are all equally protected by federal law. Firearms are prohibited in the park. Nature Study    Horseshoe Bend NMP is home to 354 wildlife species and 901 plant species. The bulk of the park’s natural resources are native to the area. Park resource specialists are actively working toward eliminating non-native species to help restore the area to its natural community at the time of the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1813. ORV Use   Off road vehicles are not permitted in anywhere in the park at this time except by park staff for administrative use. This includes all unpaved access roads. Remember to be safe while enjoying these activities, more . . .",
