NPS\/Chickasaw National Recreation Area   Â    Built by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1966, the Lake of the Arbuckles is one of the best fishing lakes in Oklahoma for catfish, perch, bass, and crappie. Thirty-six miles of shoreline and protective coves are good for trotlines, the water is unusually clear, and trolling is popular. Facilities include campgrounds, trailer spaces, picnic areas, shelters, tables, public restrooms, drinking water, boat docks, and boat ramps. The Lake is located at the confluence of the Buckhorn, Guy Sandy, and Rock Creeks. The area presents unusual opportunities, combining recreational use with scenic, scientific, and historic values.",
