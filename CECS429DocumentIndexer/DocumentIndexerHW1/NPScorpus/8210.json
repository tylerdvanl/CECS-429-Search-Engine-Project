    "body": "The Going-to-the-Sun Road Project         Completed, ongoing, and forecasted rehabilitation NPS & FHA Graphic  Going-to-the-Sun Road has been undergoing a major rehabilitation project since 2007. Visit the Federal Highway Administration's project page for construction information, photos, and mapping.  2016 Rehabilitation work on the Going-to-the-Sun Road will continue this year with activity near the St. Mary Entrance Station, though no delays are expected. Sun Point will be closed again this year to all visitor traffic including picnicking, transit, restroom use, and hiking due to road rehabilitation activity.  Â    Top Ten Things You Need to Know Going-to-the-Sun Road 2015 1. Glacier National Park is open year-round, even though Going-to-the-Sun Road is not. Most visitor services and facilities are open May through September. Autumn\/winter\/spring offer non-motorized recreation opportunities and primitive camping, available year round. Visitor services and amenities are available year round in gateway communities. 2. The Going-to-the-Sun Road (Sun Road), the first American roadway designated both a National Historic Landmark and a National Civil Engineering Landmark, began a multi-year rehabilitation in 2007. Accelerated night work and shoulder season work (after mid-September and before mid-June) cause short-term impacts to the smallest numbers of park visitors. 3. The majority of the \"Alpine\" portion of the Road (Loop to Siyeh Bend) has undergone a facelift and reconstruction of numerous structural deficiencies. Last year construction focused on the segment between Rising Sun and Siyeh Bend. This year construction will be ongoing in this segment but will also expand to encompass construction operations essentially from Siyeh Bend to the St. Mary park boundary, a total of 15 miles, however, not all of this will be under construction at the same time. All turnouts will be closed until paved, with the following exceptions: Gunsight, Grizzly, St. Mary Falls (until transit starts), Wild Goose. These are open until the paving operation requires them closed for a brief period of time. 4. Short traffic delays will occur in construction zones. Expect some one-lane directional travel and no more than a 30 minute total daytime delay. Night delays are not expected, however, if they occur, information will be advertised and signed in advance of the actual closure. 5. Schedules for the multi-year rehabilitation call for opening lower elevations in the spring as weather and work permits and opening the alpine section over Logan Pass from mid-June to mid-September. In 2015, the earliest the road will open is 7 a.m. Friday, June 19. Once open, the entire Sun Road will be open through 7 a.m. Monday, September 21, weather permitting. The St. Mary Campground will not be accessible by vehicle until June 5, 2015 due to construction operations in the area. 6. Regardless of reconstruction on the Sun Road, access to Logan Pass ends every year no later than the Monday following the third full weekend of October (October 19, 2015), weather permitting. Should snow storms and hazardous driving conditions prompt temporary closures prior to the projected October closure date; every effort will be made to reopen to Logan Pass as conditions permit. 7. More information about the Sun Road rehabilitation project and other visitor services is available at the Office of Federal Lands Highway website.

For 2015, the shuttle system will operate July 1 through September 7 from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m, weather permitting. The system is covered through the park entrance fee. Two east side shuttle are available for a fee. 9. Guided park tours are available from park concessioners via boat, bus, foot and horse. 10. The Apgar Visitor Center (located at the former Apgar Transit Center) and St. Mary Visitor Center (SMVC) offer shuttle information and other park displays and exhibits for trip planning, including a film about the Sun Road at SMVC. The St. Mary Visitor Center hosts multi-media exhibits that feature Native\/tribal perspectives about the place we today call Glacier National Park. Apgar exhibits focus on ecosystems.",
