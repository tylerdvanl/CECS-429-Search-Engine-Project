    "body": "Caving        Cave entrances can take many forms; from walk-in entrances like Valentine Cave, to entrances that are only accessible by ladders or ropes. Kenneth Ingham       What You Need To Know Before You Go Caving  Before entering any cave you must be \"screened\" for white-nose syndrome. Most information you need to know is contained in our caving brochure. Learn what it means to cave safely and cave softly, and put these ethics into practice during your visit.  Summer Seasonal Cave Closures Blue Grotto Ovis Paradise Alleys Natural Bridge Thunderbolt (up-flow from trail entrance)      Exploring the Caves Many of the developed caves contain trails through the cave and stairways or ladders into the cave. Most of the developed caves are located along Cave Loop, a 2-mile road near the visitor center. Just a short walk from the visitor center, Mushpot Cave contains exhibits and is the only lighted cave at Lava Beds. Developed caves are divided into three groups based on their varying levels of difficulty in the hardest section of the cave: least, moderate, and most challenging.       Caves come in all sizes, shapes, and colors. Easy caves are typically defined by high ceilings and smooth floors. Jesse Barden       Least Challenging These caves have relatively high ceilings and smoother floors or trails. At the very least you should use the following gear: flashlights, sturdy shoes, and head protection. Least Challenging Caves:  Mushpot Sentinel Valentine Skull Merrill Heppe Big Painted Symbol Bridge Ovis Paradise Alley        Moderately challenging caves may require some stooping and have uneven floors. Kenneth Ingham       Moderately Challenging These caves may involve stooping through low sections and\/or rough floors. Additional safety gear is recommended for the more difficult spots, including: cave maps, compass, kneepads, and gloves. Moderately Challenging Caves:  Golden Dome Sunshine Indian Well Balcony & Boulevard Blue Grotto        Most challenging caves have low, crawling passages and are often easier to get lost in than caves in the other two categories. Kenneth Ingham       Most Challenging These caves have some portions which require crawling. Using all recommended safety gear will protect you from injury. Most Callening Caves:  Labyrinth Lava Brook Hopkins Chocolate Hercules Leg Juniper Catacombs Thunderbolt       How The Caves Were Formed         Lava Beds National Monument sits on the north face of the Medicine Lake Shield Volcano. The lava tube caves found here were created by flows of smooth lava 10,500 to 65,000 years ago. As the lava flowed it began to cool and solidify on the top and sides. Once the eruption ceased, the tube emptied and drained, and a new lava tube cave is left behind. As the rock cooled, the inner surface of the tube cracked and collapsed, producing openings to the surface.  If you wish to see a lava tube form today, you can take a peak into Lava Beds past by viewing a video of a similar volcano which erupted recently enough for people to be able to capture it on film.      Home To Live In         After cooling, these lava tubes became homes for unique cave life to thrive. When exploring, you may be lucky enough to spot some cave creatures, such as a cave cricket, rubber boa, millipede, or bats. These creatures are not poisonous or dangerous to humans, treat them with respect.",
