The Park Service is responsible for all secular elements of the four missions, including buildings, landscape and visitor centers. The Old Spanish Missions, Inc. is responsible for the maintenance and restoration of the historic mission churches. The goal of Las Misiones\/Old Spanish Missions is to restore the church buildings to their original vitality by funding and partially endowing (1) the regular and scientific care of the native limestone walls and structures, and (2) the aesthetic and liturgical enhancement of the worship spaces inside the churches. All of this is to be accomplished while respecting the historic integrity of the interiors and exteriors of the churches. As the San Antonio Missions near the 300th anniversary of their founding, they continue to serve as parish churches. As churches of the Archdiocese of San Antonio, the Missions continue to serve stable communities of parishioners and numbers of visitors each year.      The Missions of San Antonio San Antonio's five Spanish colonial missions have been designated a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
