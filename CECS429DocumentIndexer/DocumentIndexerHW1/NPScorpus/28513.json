Call (724) 725-9190 to arrange a permit. You must call 14 or more days in advance in order to be considered for a wedding-related Special Use Permit. The following restrictions apply to all wedding-related events. Please read this page carefully to be certain you are interested before calling. These conditions must be agreed to in writing:  Application for a special use permit to hold a wedding on the grounds at Friendship Hill National Historic Site will be subject to a $50.00 non-refundable application fee. Payment of this fee does not guarantee your application will be approved. In accordance with Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations an application, in writing, must be submitted in time to reach the Superintendent at least 14 days in advance of the proposed event. Wedding-related events not meeting this time requirement will not be granted and the applicant will be so notified by phone, if possible. Application approvals depend upon a number of factors including the size of the wedding party including guests, amount of equipment needed, possible impediment of the visiting public to the site during the wedding activities, etc. The final decision lies with the park Superintendent. (See specific rules below for details.) Fees for weddings are scheduled based upon the costs the park incurs for your wedding to take place. Factors determining fees include the number of guests and requirements of the wedding party. This includes a cost of $100.00 for the first 100 people (wedding party and guests combined) for two hours. For each additional 100 guests, an additional $100.00 is charged. Additional fees will be charged to the permittee to cover unbudgeted costs, such as overtime, staff time to assist with the activities, pre-event activities, post-event cleanup, damages, repairs, supplies, and materials. Any such charges will be based on actual costs and billed after the event. The park grounds are open from sunrise until sunset. The Gallatin House and driveway leading to the knoll area are open from 9:00 am until 5:00 PM. Access into that area by vehicle is restricted to those hours. Foot traffic is permitted during the remainder of the parkâ€™s official hours of operation. The only area designated for weddings is located on the knoll to the west of the concrete path leading from the main parking lot near where it joins the driveway. It is a flat grassy area. The National Park Service does not supply shelters, chairs, tables, sound, or any other type of equipment, which may be needed by the wedding party. All equipment and supplies must be provided by the wedding party. Electricity is not available at designated site. The permitted activities must not unduly interfere with the operation of public use facilities, activities, or other programs within the park. Any activities deemed inappropriate by the park staff on duty will be halted immediately. Depending upon the severity of the activity, participants may be asked to leave the park. Any music provided by the wedding party must be kept at a volume, which does not impact the experience of other visitors to the historic knoll area. No alcoholic beverages are permitted within 300 feet of the Gallatin House or other visitor use facilities. No are alcoholic beverages permitted on or within 10 feet of all roads, trails, walkways, and parking lots. One to two vehicles will be designated to deliver equipment, materials, wedding party and guests to the historic knoll area. These vehicles must then be returned to the main parking lot below. Vehicles will not be parked on the historic knoll for long periods of time, especially on or near the driveway. The driveway MUST be kept clear at all times for emergency, law enforcement, and vehicles of handicapped visitors. All vehicles will be parked in the main parking lot at the foot of the knoll, with the exception of those designated as shuttle or delivery vehicles (2 total). Once the shuttle and delivery vehicles are no longer needed, they will also be parked in the main parking lot. The exception to this rule is a vehicle with appropriate handicapped permits carrying handicapped persons to the knoll area. These vehicles may be parked in the designated handicapped parking spaces near the upper frame barn. The permitted is responsible for any and all damages caused by the permitted or their patrons to the permitted cultural and natural resources, and facilities during the time of the permit. The permitted is responsible for collection and removal of all trash and litter from the designated wedding area. Trash must be carried out of the park. No trash bags will be provided by the park. All Federal, State, and local laws and regulations will be enforced. Failure to comply will be grounds for revocation of the permit. The special use permit, once granted and approved, is not transferable.
