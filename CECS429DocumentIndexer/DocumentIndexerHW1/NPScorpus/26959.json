There are no hookups or leveled parking sites. Each campsite is limited to eight people, three tents and two vehicles. There are three campgrounds with accessible sites. One primitive campground can be found along Snake Creek Road.Lower Lehman Creek is the only campground open year-round. Other campgrounds are generally open May-through-October, weather permitting. Water may not be available early and late in the season. Since exact opening and closing dates are dependent on weather conditions, contact a visitor center at (775) 234-7331 or check our current conditions online before arrival. ReservationsMost park camping is on a first-come, first-served basis, but reservations can be made for some sites at the Grey Cliffs Campground. All camping reservations are now handled by Recreation.gov. Campsites may not be \"saved\" or reserved for family or friends arriving later. Because campgrounds often fill on weekends and holidays during the summer months, visitors are advised to find a campsite early in the day. Camping Fees $12.00 for developed campgrounds per night\/per site. $6.00 for Golden Age\/Golden Access card holders. Strawberry Creek Campground and Snake Creek Campground have no fee. Primitive campgrounds have no fee.  Group Camping Large groups can be accommodated at the Grey Cliffs Campground. Three designated group sites provide privacy and ensure that groups do not disturb campers staying at the individual sites in Loop A. Go to the Group Camping page for more information. Reservations are required for group camping and can be made at Recreation.gov.      RV Sanitary Station There is a dump station, potable water, and trash receptacles located 1\/2 mile inside the park on the main entrance road (NV Hwy 488).
