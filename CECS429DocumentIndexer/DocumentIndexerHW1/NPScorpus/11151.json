Volunteers are vital to fulfilling the mission of the National Park Service (NPS), providing critical help in conserving our nation's most treasured places, providing public access and education, and ensuring that these places survive and thrive for generations to come.  Frederick Law Olmsted National Historic Site offers a variety of meaningful volunteer opportunities at Fairsted. Find one that is a good fit for your background, interests, and personality. As a small site, there are opportunities to develop connections with our professional staff, our stories, and our physical resources. We utilize volunteers in our visitor services and public programming, our curriculum-based programs for local schools, and occasionally for help in maintaining our historic grounds. There may also be other types of opportunities that come up from time to time.        Olmsted NHS is currently seeking Park Educators Park Educators work within the Education Division to support Good Neighbors: Landscape Design & Community Building- an active, place-based education program that fosters appreciation of the physical, social, and psychological value of public parks in local third graders. Good Neighbors uses the restored landscape, historic design office, archival collection, and rehabilitated model shop to explore the history, art, science, and civics of landscape design and park stewardship. Participating students learn why parks are important for people, and begin to imagine their own role in the care and stewardship of these special landscapes. Park Educators assist NPS staff with teaching and logistical oversight of on-site programming. For more information on the program, visit the Good Neighbors page. If you have any questions or would like to apply, please contact Brianne Cassetta by email or phone (617-566-1689 ext 238).       Thank you to our amazing volunteer corps! We celebrated the over 4000 hours served with some of our VIPs at our Volunteers in Parks Recognition Day 2013.
