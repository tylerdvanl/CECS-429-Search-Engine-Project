    "body": "Mesa Verde Digital Herbarium       Mesa Verde National Park has joined other national parks, national forests, universities, tribes, museums, and other organizations to make their herbarium collections accessible to the public through the Southwest Environmental Information Network (SEINet), an online gateway for information about the flora and environment of the Southwest U.S. The SEINet web interface provides users with tools to access, search, and work with integrated digital herbaria and other datasets that include over one million specimen records. The site provides access to thousands of images of herbarium sheets, field photos, and close-up photos of individual plant parts. In addition, users can create plant checklists from specific regions of interest and create location maps. In addition to the Mesa Verde National Park herbarium, SEINet also includes digital images of herbarium specimens from many other NPS units in the Southwest, including Grand Canyon National Park, Petrified Forest National Park, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, Canyon de Chelly National Monument, Sunset Crater National Monument, Walnut Canyon National Monument, and Wupatki National Monument.  Â    Directions for searching Mesa Verde's digital herbarium in SEINet:  Go to http:\/\/swbiodiversity.org\/seinet\/projects\/index.php?proj=5 Select the Mesa Verde National Park After you search for a specimen, click on the species name to view image(s) and detailed information about the species.  There are images of about 95% of the species that occur in Colorado, which is a great tool to have when identifying specimens.",
