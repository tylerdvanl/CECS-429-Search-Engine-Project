The essence of place is its wild beauty...\"  Under Secretary of the Interior Oscar Chapman at the dedication of Isle Royale National Park, 1946  Superintendent's Compendium In accordance with regulations and the delegated authority provided in Title 36, Code of Federal Regulations (\"36 CFR\"), Chapter 1, Parts 1-7, authorized by Title 16 United States Code, Section 3, the following provisions apply to all lands and waters administered by the National Park Service, within the boundaries of Isle Royale National Park. Unless otherwise stated, these regulatory provisions apply in addition to the requirements contained in 36 CFR, Chapter 1, Parts 1-7.  Written determinations that explain the reasoning behind the Superintendent's use of discretionary authority, as required by Section 1.5(c), appear in Section IV of this document. View a copy of the Park Superintendent's Compendium.  Unmanned aircraft including hobbyists  Until the NPS can determine whether specific uses of unmanned aircraft are appropriate and will not cause unacceptable impacts on park resources and values, Isle Royale National Park is closed to the use of these devices. The use of unmanned aircraft within the boundaries of the park has the potential to harm visitors, disturb wildlife, impact viewsheds, cause excessive noise, and interfere with other visitors' enjoyment of the area and may be incompatible with the purposes for which the park was established, including providing those opportunities for recreational, use and experiences which are compatible with the preservation of the park's wilderness character. A less restrictive approach is not appropriate at this time due the the impacts the devices could potentially present.  Firearms and other weapons  Legislation: As of February 22, 2010, a new federal law allows people who can legally possess firearms under applicable federal, state, and local laws to legally possess firearms in this park.

Human Waste Never defecate within 100 feet (at least 75 steps) of lakes, streams, trails, gullies, or campsites. In areas without outhouses, select a site that visitors are unlikely to discover.

Quiet Hours Quiet hours are between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. EDT, if people in adjacent campsites can hear your activities, you are being too loud.  Respect Wildlife Observe, photograph, and enjoy park wildlife from a safe distance. If animals flee, become defensive, or change their natural activities in your presence, you are too close.  Keep wild animals wild by discouraging them from approaching humans. Practice proper food storage and keep a clean camp. It is illegal to feed, touch, tease, or intentionally disturb wildlife, their homes, nests, or activities.   Traps and Nets The use or possession of traps and nets is prohibited.  Trash Pack-out everything you pack-in and if possible, dispose of it on the mainland. Leftover food, food-scraps, orange peels, nutshells, apple cores, twist-ties, candy wrappers, fishing line, and cigarette butts must be packed out. If you have food leftovers, either save and eat them later or pack them out. Do not burn, bury, or place trash, food scraps or garbage in outhouses. Help keep the park clean by packing-out what you pack-in.  Waste Water Disposal  Cleaning Cookware Most cookware can be cleaned with hot water, a little elbow grease, and sand or other natural scrubbers. Clean cookware at least 200 feet (75 steps) from lakes, streams, trails, gullies, or campsites. Soap is unnecessary for most dishwashing jobs. Use these products sparingly and keep them at least 100 feet (75 steps) from water sources and campsites.
