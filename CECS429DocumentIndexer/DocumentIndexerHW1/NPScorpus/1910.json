Chartered by Congress in 1967, the National Park Foundation is founded on a legacy that began more than a century ago, when private citizens from all walks of life took action to establish and protect our national parks. Today, the National Park Foundation carries on that tradition as the only national charitable nonprofit whose sole mission is to directly support the National Park Service.  Mesa Verde Museum Association MVMA is the innovative educational nonprofit partner that inspires life-long stewardship of Mesa Verde's and Yucca House's cultural and natural heritage. Since 1930, MVMA has supported education and research through an active publishing program, membership program, in-depth learning opportunities, and retail stores. Proceeds from all their programs generate hundreds of thousands of dollars in park support each year.  Mesa Verde Foundation MVF is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, philanthropic partner to Mesa Verde National Park and Yucca House National Monument. Their purpose is to help secure funds for improvements, projects and educational endeavors that promote an understanding of the parks' cultural and natural resources.",
