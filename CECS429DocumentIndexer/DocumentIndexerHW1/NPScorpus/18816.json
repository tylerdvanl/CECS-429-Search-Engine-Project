The collection is divided into three main categories: natural history, cultural resources and archives.  The natural history collection is represented by biological specimens and geological samples.  The herbarium includes native and non-native plants that have been collected from the park and East Maui.  The entomological collection consists of mounted native and non-native insects collected within the island of Maui.  The cultural resources collection is represented by archeological, historical and ethnographic objects and works of art.  The archives consist mostly of documents and photographs about the history, development and management activities of the park.  The archives have not been processed and finding aids (lists summarizing the contents) are currently unavailable.
