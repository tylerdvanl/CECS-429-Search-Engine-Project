    "body": "Park Boundary Information       These files are made available for download to provide GPS users with coordinates for the boundary of Denali National Park and Preserve as well as the boundary of the park's wilderness area. Their accuracy may vary depending on observation conditions and GPS model used. The base maps provided with many available GPS units may not be correct. Users should confirm the accuracy of these maps with the information shown below or with USGS maps that show wilderness, park, and preserve boundaries.  Additional park maps and GPS information are also available here   Definitions: PDF - a computer file format that can be viewed on a wide variety of computers (Apple, PC, etc.). Adobe Acrobat Reader, which is required to view these files is available for free from www.adobe.com. GPX - a file format used by many GPS units for transferring coordinate information between a computer and the GPS. Software to make this transfer may be available from the GPS manufacturer and is also available from a number of third-party sources by searching for \"GPX\" on the internet. KML - a file format used by a variety of mapping applications, such as Google Earth and NASA WorldWind for viewing mapping data such as roads, boundaries, rivers. Waypoint - a point on a map or GPS screen created from a set of coordinates, usually latitude and longitude. A set of waypoints can be used to define a line (boundary) by connecting the dots.  Boundary information is provided in a variety of formats: maps and a table in Adobe Acrobat (PDF); GPX files of the same information that can be uploaded into the GPS; KML files containing boundary information viewable using applications such as Google Earth and NASA WorldWind.    Map of Park Additions Boundary Points-This is a map of the park in PDF format. It shows a number of waypoints along the exterior boundary of the park. Each waypoint is labeled with the letter \"B\" and a sequential number. These points do not correspond to the locations of any physical features on the ground. They simply represent points spaced along the boundary line to aid in navigation. The coordinates for these waypoints can be found in the next link.     Locations of Boundary Waypoints- This is a table in PDF format listing the waypoint coordinates from the above map. The coordinates use WGS-84 as the map datum. On GPS units used by the general public coordinates based on the two map datums, WGS-84 and NAD83, represent the same locations. Before entering the coordinates into your GPS make sure the unit is set to one of these two datums. Manually enter the coordinates from either the decimal degrees or decimal minutes columns of this table into the GPS using the manufacturer's directions. The boundary would be on a line drawn between any two adjacent waypoints.     Map of Former Mt. McKinley NP Points - This map is similar to the first map and is in PDF format. It shows a number of waypoints along the former Mt. McKinley NP boundary. Each is labeled with the letter \"W\" and a sequential number. These points do not correspond to the locations of any physical features on the ground. They represent points spaced along the boundary line to aid in navigation. Download the coordinates for these points.     Park Additions Boundary Points GPX File- GPX is a universal file format that many GPS units can read. Once this file is downloaded onto your computer you can use one of a variety of software programs to upload the data into your GPS. The GPS manufacturer may have an application for this purpose or third-party software can be found by searching the internet for \"GPX.\" Once this file is uploaded to the GPS all the boundary waypoints should be viewable on the unit. A line may also be added to the unit as a route or track and should show the outer boundary line for Denali National Park and Preserve.     Former Mt. McKinley NP Boundary Points GPX File- GPX is a universal file format that many GPS units can read. Once this file is downloaded onto your computer you can use one of a variety of software programs to upload the data into your GPS. The GPS manufacturer may have an application for this purpose or third-party software can be found by searching the internet for \"GPX.\" Once this file is uploaded to the GPS all the boundary waypoints for the wilderness boundary should be viewable. A line showing that boundary line may also appear on the screen as a track or route.     GIS data viewable in WorldWind, Google Earth, etc.- These downloadable files are in KML format. If you have Google Earth or a similar program installed on your computer clicking on these links will automatically open them in those programs where they can be viewed.",
