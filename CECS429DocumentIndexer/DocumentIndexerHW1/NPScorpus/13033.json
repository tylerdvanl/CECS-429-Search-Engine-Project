The survey goals include determining the distributions and densities of fish in the park, establishing a baseline for continued health and population monitoring, obtaining an idea of the health of the streams based on fish populations and collecting preliminary water chemistry and physical habitat data. The Park Service plans on using the information collected as part of a larger effort to help develop a management plan for aquatic resources in the region. Up until now, only the following species have been documented in the park:Brown BullheadAmerican EelCentral StonerollerWhite Sucker Checkered Sculpin Spotfin Shiner Carp Greenside Darter Tessellated Darter NorthernHogsucker GreenSunfish BluegillCommon ShinerSmallmouth BassLargemouth BassRedhorse Sucker Rosyface ShinerRainbow Trout Yellow Perch Bluntnose MinnowBlacknose DaceLongnose DaceBrown TroutBrook TroutCreek Chub",
