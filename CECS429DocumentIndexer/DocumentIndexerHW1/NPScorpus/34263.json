Cyclists may use the Ridge Trail, Difficult Run Trail, and Carriage Road Trail, but must yield to pedestrians and horses. Trail maps are available in the visitor center and at the entrance station. Biking to the park is not recommended. Georgetown Pike and Old Dominion Drive are two-lane roads with no shoulders and no bike paths. Both roads are narrow, with sharp turns and curves that make it difficult for vehicles to see cyclists. Cyclists are encouraged to drive their bicycles to the park. Trails can be reached easily from the parking lots. A bike rack is available behind the visitor center. Please lock up your bicycle if you need to leave it unattended.",
