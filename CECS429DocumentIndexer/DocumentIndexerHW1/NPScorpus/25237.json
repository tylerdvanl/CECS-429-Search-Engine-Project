June 3-4, 1942 Nearly six months to the day after Pearl Harbor, the Japanese struck again on American soil. The bombing of Dutch Harbor signalled the beginning of the Aleutian Campaign and led, in part, to the evacuation and internment of American civilians for the duration of the war. Learn more about the bombing of Dutch Harbor, the Japanese pilots, the American defenders, the innocent victims, and the aftermath.         The Japanese Invade, June 6 - 7, 1942 In early June, 1942, the Japanese followed the Dutch Harbor raid with an invasion of American soil. After months of reconnaissance, they landed on Kiska and Attu Islands in the Western Aleutians, over 1,000 miles from Dutch Harbor. On Kiska, they took a small Naval weather crew captive; on Attu, they took the whole village hostage, later shipping them back to Japan as prisoners of war.  Read more about  the Japanese invasion and the 1943 re-taking of the island by American forces.           Evacuation and Internment, 1942 - 1945 In the aftermath of the Japanese invasion, U.S. authorities scrambled to get civilians out of the war zone. As a result, nearly 900 Unangax (Aleut) people were suddenly uprooted, evacuated from their homes with only a suitcase each, crammed onto crowded transport ships, and taken to internment camps in Southeast Alaska. They would remain in dismal, crowded conditions, suffering from disease and malnutrition, for three long years. Learn more about this little-known chapter in American history.  Even after the war, some villages remained empty, their residents forbidden to return. Ostensibly for their own safety, the U.S. Government did not allow the Unangan displaced from Attu, Biorka, Kashega, and Makushin - the Lost Villages - to resettle.",
