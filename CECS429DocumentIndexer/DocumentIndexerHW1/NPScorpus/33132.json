The length of this hike, however, makes it a two-day experience.  Starting at Mowich Lake, follow the Wonderland trail south, descending to the South Mowich River before climbing a steep ascent up to Golden Lakes. NOTE: Always check current trail conditions before heading out. Log footbridges frequently wash out during the winter or other conditions could be affecting the trail.  Along the Trail Enjoy the hike through old growth forest to the South Mowich River, before reaching Golden Lakes. A historic Patrol Cabin still stands near the trail at Golden Lakes. Backpacking Some of the campsites at Golden Lakes provide good views and easy access to the lakes. Permits are required for camping. Permits and current trail conditions are available park-wide from wilderness information centers, ranger stations, and visitor centers. Fires are prohibited. No pets on trails. Treat water before drinking.",
