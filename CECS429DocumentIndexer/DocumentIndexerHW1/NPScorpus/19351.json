Smith's family lived next door to the Hoover family's second home. NPS Photo  The P.T. Smith House is the only house that Herbert Hoover remembered when he visited West Branch many years later. While living in the House of Maples, the Hoover children and Smith children were playmates. Their homes stood at the base of Cook's Hill, a favorite winter sledding spot. Hoover recalled:   \"That was a great long hill where on wintersâ€™ nights, to satisfy our human craving for speed, we slid down at terrific pace with our tummies tight to home-made sleds.\"",
