Below are links to Applications for a Special Use Permit. Applications must be received at least 2 weeks before the date of the proposed event. A non-refundable application fee of $50.00 in the form of a check or money order made out to the National Park Service is to accompany your application. Current National Park Service policy states that \"A permittee, while on park property, may not collect admission or any other money associated with a special event. All permittee monetary transactions must take place outside the park\". Other costs may be incurred by the National Park Service as a result of your event. They include the costs involved with monitoring the event, inspecting black powder weapons, and directing traffic and other associated costs. Your permit will contain an estimate of these costs and you will be billed for these services after the event. Permit holders must supply the equipment required for their event. Thank you for your interest in Antietam National Battlefield. If you have questions please contact the Special Use Permit Coordinator at 301-432-2243.
