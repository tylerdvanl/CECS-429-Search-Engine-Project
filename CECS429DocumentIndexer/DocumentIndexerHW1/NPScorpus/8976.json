How fast can you run down? Do you think I could roll all the way down? No doubt one of the biggest attractions for the young people is to head to the Dune Climb. After you get sand in your hair and clothes, it’s time to head for the lake and let the cool clean water of Lake Michigan wash over you. Build sand castles on the beach or body surf on the Lake Michigan waves.        Kids help the ranger save the survivors of a shipwreck at the Maritime Museum Kerry Kelly 2005  Ranger-led Programs Heroes of the Storm is a re-enactment of a turn-of-the-century shipwreck rescue. This program is designed especially for children and requires some audience participation. This is held at the Maritime Museum. Once a week, we fire the Lyle Gun which was used as part of the rescue process for more than 75 years.  Each evening, there is a free ranger program at various places in the park. These are fun for young and old alike. Check the Schedule of Events to learn about the different topics and when and where they will be presented.
