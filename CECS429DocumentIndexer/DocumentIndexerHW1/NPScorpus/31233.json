NPS Photo  Piecing Our History Together   Humans have frequented the Canadian River region of the Texas Panhandle for at least 13,000 years, from early hunter-gatherers, explorers, and military, to ranchers, settlers, and geologists. In some instances, there is little evidence of their stay, and we must carefully piece together the circumstances of their lives. But for many, the prehistoric villages and campsites, historic structures, artifacts, and written record vividly tell of their existence on the High Plains.  Â       The McBride Ranch House is a historic structure that gives us a glimpse of early ranching and homesteading in the Texas Panhandle.",
