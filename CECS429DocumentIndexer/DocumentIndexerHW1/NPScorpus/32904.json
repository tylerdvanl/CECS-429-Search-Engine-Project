Located on western Washington's Olympic Peninsula, extreme weather conditions make maintaining these trails a tremendous feat. At Olympic, our volunteers are dedicated to helping us keep these trails accessible for our visitors. Adopt-A-Trail (AAT) is a voluntary trail adoption program available to motivated groups of volunteers from the communities surrounding Olympic National Park.  ONP AAT Crew Responsibilities  Attend a park-led Adopt-A-Trail training. Commit to at least 3 work days per year. Group size 2-12 persons. Report trail work and conditions. Communicate with local AAT coordinator.  Getting Started - The Process  Find your perfect trail match on Olympic's Orphaned Trails listing. Fill out a group application and submit via mail or fax to the address provided. After application approval, attend a park-led AAT Training in the field. Come prepared for hard work and inclement weather. Fill out a Trail Work Report for each work day and e-mail us to submit.  Need Course Credits? Adopt-A-Trail Youth Crew is a Senior Culminating Project that was developed especially for local high school student groups looking to use the AAT program for school credit, learn more here.",
