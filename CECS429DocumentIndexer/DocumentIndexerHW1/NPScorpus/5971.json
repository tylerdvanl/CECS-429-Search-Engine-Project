Approximately 15 acres of warm season grasses will be planted with the goal of increased diversity and abundance of ground nesting birds such as the vesper sparrow and the eastern meadowlark, as well as mammals such as the field mouse and the cottontail rabbit. Meadows also provide increased riparian buffers to the nearby waterways, thus following regional Chesapeake Watershed Initiatives. Establishment of these meadows will also help in the preservation of the cultural landscape of the park by reducing invasive, non-native vegetation. In addition to implementing the warm season grasses project, a management plan for the future of the meadows will be created.",
