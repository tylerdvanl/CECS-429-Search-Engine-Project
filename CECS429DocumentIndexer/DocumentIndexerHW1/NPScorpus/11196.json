    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Safety            Safety          We are located in a suburban neighborhood with winding roads. Caution should be used when traveling to the site, especially when walking from public transportation. Blind spots and lack of crosswalks make crossing Warren Street a challenge. Once at the site, be careful walking the grounds. Some areas use stone walkways and can be uneven. Stairs to the sunken garden known as the \"Hollow\" are especially uneven and caution should be used, especially if they are icy or wet. Interior spaces call for an unexpected stair to be navigated.",
