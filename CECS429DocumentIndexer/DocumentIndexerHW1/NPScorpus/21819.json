Established by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) on December 2, 1980, the park and preserve support an ongoing tradition of subsistence culture in a volcanic and partly glaciated landscape containing habitat for wilderness dependent species of fish and wildlife. Lake Clark offers excellent opportunities for adventure, exploration, learning, and just plain having fun!
