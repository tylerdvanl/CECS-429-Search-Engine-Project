Many of these images relate to the work of the Olmsted firm, but some were of the Olmsted family and their life here at Fairsted. Over the next few months we will be adding both these historic images as well as images of contemporary programs and events both here at Olmsted NHS and out in the community. Digitizing the approximately 140,000 plans and drawings, 66,000 photographs and thousands of office documents is an ongoing process.
