Our 2016 Junior Ranger Explorer Summer Camp has concluded. We had a great week with this young men and women exploring places like Hot Springs, AR and Little Rock Central High School, and we are sure they enjoyed it as well. We are already looking forward next year, and we are hoping to have as good of a camp then as we did this time.       \"Finding Your Adventure\" a Salute to National Park System (LITTLE ROCK, ARK.) –Secretary of State Mark Martin would like to invite Arkansans to visit the Capitol and view the new summer exhibit on display in the first floor galleries. On August 25, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson signed into law a measure creating a new agency within the Department of the Interior, charged with managing an assortment of over thirty places already set aside by the federal government. That agency, the National Park Service, would grow both in size and in responsibilities carried. Today, as it approaches its 100th birthday, the National Park Service oversees more than four hundred sites encompassing more than 84 million acres spread across the United States, its trust territories and protectorates. Finding Your Adventure, the Arkansas Capitol's summer exhibit for 2016, is a birthday salute to the National Park System (NPS) and a \"sampler\" of its Arkansas sites. They are distinguished by their variety: in them, one may take a hike, sink into a thermal bath or float a river. One can stand where battles raged in the Civil War and in the Civil Rights Movement, explore an historic courthouse or a U.S. President's childhood home and much more. The exhibit features artifacts and images selected by staff members from each of the seven NPS sites within Arkansas. Architectural details and bath house memorabilia represent Hot Springs National Park, while Fort Smith National Historic Site's offerings include a court document pertaining to notorious bank robber Henry Starr, signed by famed \"hanging judge\" Isaac Parker. Buffalo National River is represented by a half-canoe, crafted from a wrecked watercraft by park staff, while the William J. Clinton Birthplace and Home contributes a Little Golden Book once the property of a young Billy Blythe, the future president. For 100 years the National Park Service has protected the nation's natural and cultural treasures, preserved its stories and provided opportunities for recreation, learning, discovery and awe. These are your public lands and in this Centennial Anniversary year, the Capitol, along with the NPS, encourages visitors—natives and out-of-staters alike—to seek and find adventure in a national park in Arkansas.  Finding your Adventure will remain on display through Labor Day.        View of the inner canyon at Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park NPS photo  Featured Parks  2016 is a special year for the National Park Service. This is the year we celebrate our Centennial, our 100th birthday! To help get ready for our big day on August 25th, President William Jefferson Clinton Birthplace Home National Historic Site is going to feature a different park every few days. To add another element to this, all the parks we are featuring were designated as NPS sites during President Bill Clinton's time in the white house.  Our featured park today is Black Canyon of The Gunnison National Park in Colorado. While this canyon is not as big as the Grand Canyon, it is still a sight to behold. Black Canyon of The Gunnison has numerous opportunities for outdoor enjoyment. This is a great place for rock climbing, hiking, fishing and even scenic drives. Please keep in mind that Black Canyon is very steep, as some of the canyon walls are nearly vertical. As a result, both climbing routes and hiking trails are very difficult.    Please go to www.NPS.gov\/blca for more information about Black Canyon of The Gunnison National Park, things you should know, and how to get there.        Portion of the cover of Growing up Jim Crow, by Jennifer Ritterhouse.
