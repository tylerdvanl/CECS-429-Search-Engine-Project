We will plan on confirming dates starting in August. Please note that we have a wait list from this past school year and teachers on this list will have priority for programs. Thank you for your interest in our programs. The EcoHelpers program is curriculum-based and focuses on science principles learned through hands-on restoration activities. There are two versions of the program.  Planting Program: Offered January, February, March, and April. This program focuses on removing non-native invasive plants and restoring native plants. Crayfish Removal Program: Offered November, December, May, and June. This program focuses on removing non-native invasive crayfish from our local streams. Both programs will improve the habitat for wildlife in the Santa Monica Mountains. Students will understand that invasive plants and animals can damage the natural communities that produce food and shelter to sustain native wildlife. Students will recognize that improving natural communities can improve native habitats, food chains, and the local food web. 2015-2016 School Year Application  Contact Santa Monica Mountains Education Program Staff email us 805 370-2348 or 805 370-2314  Details  Subject: Biology: Animals, Biology: Plants, Civic Engagement, Climate, Climate Change, Community, Conservation, Earth Science, Ecology, Environment, Fire Ecology, Landscapes, Planning\/Development, Public Policy, Wildlife Biology, Wildlife Management National\/State Standards: California Benchmarks for Biology\/Life Sciences: Ecology, Language Arts and History\/Social Science: Historical Interpretation and Los Angeles Unified School District’s Service Learning requirements for Graduation. type: Field Trips              Lesson Plans  Exploring Climate Science: Research Projects   Climate Science in Focus: Earth as a System   Exploring Climate Science: Climate Change    Distance Learning  Climate Connections   Climate Connections - Climate Science in Focus   Video and Audio Blogs     Field Trips  Climate Science in Focus Field Trip   Exploring Climate Science: Snow Course Field Trip   Experience Grant-Kohrs Ranch    Topics  A Soldier's Notes From Michigan's Big Battle   Why Here?
