Unfortunately, the grass family includes a large number of invasive weeds and the once plentiful native grasses are now being dominated by the non-native and highly invasive cheat grass (Bromus tectorum).  Most of the natural vegetation on nonpublic land has been replaced by agricultural crops. The numerous acres of irrigated farmlands now support a variety of grasses, grain crops, sugar beets, and potatoes.       Highly invasive cheatgrass dominates this field.
