    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Safety            Safety       Time has taken its toll on the features of Fort Schwatka, and visitors should be aware of the hazards that exist within the National Historic Area.   This site preserves bunkers that are still in excellent condition; however, many tunnel entrances leading into the bunkers are unstable or have collapsed. Many of the floors were constructed of wood that has rotted over the years. There is no electricity on Ulakta Head and the underground buildings and tunnels are dark. Enter into these tunnels and bunkers at your own risk. Cliff edges and collapsed tunnels may be hidden by dense fog.   Soldiers deployed anti-personnel stakes (known also as Rommel stakes or screw pickets) throughout the area during World War II. Some of these stakes still remain in the ground. These stakes are large and sharp -- however, the vegetation on the island covers many of them. Stepping or falling on them could lead to serious injuries. It is advisable to remain on the roads and trails to prevent unnecessary injuries! Please closely supervise children and pets in the park.",
