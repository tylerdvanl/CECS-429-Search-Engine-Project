The American elm here at Fairsted bore witness to integral years of Frederick Law Olmsted's career and continued to watch over his sons and associates as they perpetuated his legacy. The Witness Tree Project, a partnership between NPS and RISD, honors the significance of the fallen elm as students crafted Olmsted related objects from its wood.
