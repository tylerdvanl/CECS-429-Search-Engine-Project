We are excited to have you join us in celebrating the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service (NPS). On August 25, 1916, Congress passed the National Park Service Organic Act “to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wildlife therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such a manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.” What a challenging mandate, but one that daily inspires the men and women of the NPS. We are working to protect these special places for you, your children, your grandchildren and many generations to come. This celebration is not only about honoring the past but envisioning the future by welcoming a new generation of visitors and stewards to their national parks. Harpers Ferry National Historical Park is proud to be one of over 400 units of the National Park System preserving decades of American history and stunning landscapes. At the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers, you encounter a compelling history in our American narrative. George Washington chose Harpers Ferry as the site for a US Armory and from there early manufacturing innovations fueled the Industrial Revolution. It was here that abolitionist John Brown struck a blow against slavery that ignited a Civil War, trapping the town between the North and the South. In the wake of the war’s devastation, legendary Civil Rights leaders met at Storer College and “claimed every single right that belongs to a freeborn American.”  To showcase these inspiring sites and share these amazing stories, Harpers Ferry NHP, along with our park partners, will be offering an array of special events, workshops, hikes, tours, and educational and living history programs in 2016. The park is promoting the national “Every Kid in a Park” program, and adopting a centennial class at Harpers Ferry Middle School. In June, the park will host the unveiling of an America the Beautiful Quarters® Program coin in partnership with the United States Mint.  As you can see, we have a full agenda planned. We look forward to seeing you out on the trails, enjoying a concert, or participating in a tour or workshop. You will be renewed and inspired by visiting a national park. After all, they belong to YOU to preserve, protect, and enjoy for generations to come.  – Rebecca L.
