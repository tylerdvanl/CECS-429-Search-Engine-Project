In the Visitor Centers, one will find informative exhibits about the natural and cultural history of the Point Reyes area. Please see our Visitor Centers page to learn more about the Bear Valley, Kenneth C. Patrick and Lighthouse Visitor Centers. Or visitors with an appointment are welcome to check out the artwork that is on display in the Red Barn Classroom.

SOS presentations may be offered as a \"Ranger's Choice\" program at 1:30 pm on weekends. Check the program schedule on our Schedule of Events: Weekend Ranger Programs page, or stop by or call the Bear Valley Visitor Center at 415-464-5100 x2 x5 to learn when the next SOS program will be offered. We also have a variety of SOS films which can be viewed at other times of the day.  Science On a Sphere® is a room sized, global display system that uses computers and video projectors to display planetary data onto a six foot diameter sphere, analogous to a giant animated globe. Researchers at NOAA developed SOS® as an educational tool to help illustrate Earth System science to people of all ages. Animated images of atmospheric storms, climate change, and ocean temperature can be shown on the sphere, which is used to explain complex environmental processes in a way that is simultaneously intuitive and captivating. Top of Page      Red Barn Art Exhibitions In 2003, Point Reyes National Seashore Association (PRNSA) established the art gallery in the Red Barn Classroom at Point Reyes National Seashore. Rotating painting, photography, and educational exhibits several times a year, themes of the selected shows reflect the natural or cultural aspects of the Seashore and surrounding area. PRNSA sponsors the Art Exhibitions and handles all art show sales, a portion of which supports the Point Reyes National Seashore Museum and Archives Research Services. The Red Barn art gallery is open by appointment only, weekdays, 9 am to 4 pm; closed weekends and holidays and as otherwise noted. Please contact Carola DeRooy at 415-464-5125 or by email or Deborah Morgan at 415-464-5218 or by email to schedule an appointment or for more information.
