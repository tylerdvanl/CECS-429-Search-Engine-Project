Originally the Chilkoot Trial was a corridor of braided routes used and maintained by the Tlingit and Tagish people, native people of Southeast Alaska and Canada First Nations, for trade between the coast and the interior.  During the late 19th century foreign traders and gold seekers began to use the route.  The trail became overrun with people from around the world during the Klondike Gold Rush from 1897-1899. The trail became industrialized with tramways, towns, and more.  It was a hustling bustling corridor among a vast wilderness. Today 2000 people hike the trail annually to retrace the footsteps of history and seek solitude along the scenic and historic trail.",
