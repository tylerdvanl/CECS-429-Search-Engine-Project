Here one can obtain information on current weather, road and trail conditions, or watch one of the orientation films. You can also pick up a camping permit here if you wish to stay overnight in one of the Seashore's campgrounds. In the immediate vicinity of the Bear Valley Visitor Center are a few short nature trails and other interpretive exhibits. A few of the more popular hiking trails start here as well.  Beyond the Bear Valley Visitor Center are roads that lead to beaches, trailheads, and other points of interest, such as the Lighthouse Visitor Center and Kenneth C.
