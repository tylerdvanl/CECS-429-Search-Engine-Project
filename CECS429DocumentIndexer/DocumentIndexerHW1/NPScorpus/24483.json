As a result of this dedication, Kenai Fjords is on the edge of climate change research in national parks.      Climate Research at Kenai Fjords Researchers at Kenai Fjords National Park work together with university researchers and scientists from other government agencies to understand the unique changes that are affecting the Harding Icefield and the glaciers of Kenai Fjords. One of the areas that has received the most interest is the rapid retreat of the many of the park's glaciers. Researchers are also interested in learning more about the role weather plays in shaping the unique feature of the park.          Alaska Park Science: Volume 3 \/ Issue 1, 2004 COVER PHOTO © PAGE SPENCER  \"The Harding Icefield's Clue to Climate Science:\" This article for Alaska Park Science outlines the effects that climate change is having on the Harding Icefield and its outflowing glaciers.      Resource Briefs - Alaska The National Park Service-Alaska Regional Office has issued several state-wide resource briefs to showcase what is being studied in the parks of Alaska, the impacts that are being felt throughout.
