In this play on words, a \"bight\" is actually a bay (Snake Bight) within a larger bay (Florida Bay). Enter another world as you walk through a tropical hardwood hammock wuth dozens of tropical trees species. There's great bird watching on the boardwalk at the end of the trail if you plan to arrive near high tide.              Rowdy Bend Trail (walk or bicycle) Explore an overgrown road bed through shady buttonwoods and open coastal prairie. This is an opportunity for good woodland bird watching. Combine this trail with the main park road (use caution!) and the Snake Bight Trail for a 12.6 mile round-trip bike ride from the Flamingo Visitor Center.             Christian Point Trail (walk)Wander along a rustic path through a wide variety of habitats. The trail begins in dense mangroves and buttonwoods full of bromeliads, or airplants. Next, investigate the unusual, salt-loving vegetation of open coastal prairie. Dead buttonwood snags interrupt these expanses that were shaped by hurricanes. Finally, you'll end up along the shore of Snake Bight, best viewed near high tide.             Bear Lake Trail (walk and paddle) Journey through a dense hardwood hammock mixed with mangroves. The trail follows the old Homestead Canal, built in 1922, and is an excellent area for woodland birds. There are more than 50 different tree species. Bike, drive, or walk to the end of Bear Lake Road to begin this trail, which ends at Bear Lake.             Eco Pond Trail (walk) Due to the salt intrusion from storm surges during the hurricane season of 2005, Eco Pond is in a state of change. Wading birds, shorebirds and occasional crocodiles can be seen.             Guy Bradley Trail (walk) Mingle with a variety of birds and butterflies, as you amble along the shore of Florida Bay. Old pier pilings are a reminder that Flamingo was once a small fishing village. The trail was named for Audubon warden Guy Bradley, murdered in 1905 by plume hunters while trying to protect a bird rookery in Florida Bay. This is a scenic shortcut between the campground day-use area and the visitor center.              Bayshore Loop Trail (walk) Meander along the shore of Florida Bay, watching for remnants of an outpost fishing village. Begin at the Coastal Prairie trailhead at the back of Loop \"C\" in the campground. Veer left at the trail junction to the bay.              Coastal Prairie Trail (walk) Step back in time as you walk this old road once used by cotton pickers and fishermen. Open prairies of succulent coastal plants dotted with shady buttonwoods surround you as you journey toward the shore of Florida Bay. Begin at the rear of Loop \"C\" in the campground. A backcountry permit is required for camping at Clubhouse Beach.      Click here for a summary and map of the Flamingo Trails.",
