Over 20 inches of precipitation a year created a lush environment for the development and survival of a wide variety of animals.   Today the Hagerman area receives less than 10 inches of precipitation.  However, due to the Snake River, natural springs, and other water sources, the area is still able to support an incredible diverse species population. The riparian zones of the Hagerman area support habitat that is important for migratory waterfowl and other many other species.   Plant and animal communities have been greatly impacted by manâ€™s activities over time, including livestock grazing, water diversions, road construction, and recreational uses. Despite these difficulties a wide variety of animals still successfully populate the area.
