Bouldering is fast becoming one of the most popular activities at Obed Wild and Scenic River. It is a form of climbing that generally involves shorter routes that are closer to the ground.  A short 0.4 mile trail leads from the Lilly Bluff Overlook Parking Lot to the Boulder Field which contains 164 boulder problems scaling 24 boulders ranging in height from 8-20+ feet with names such as “The Muscle Block” and “Tilted World.”  The problems include beginner-friendly V0s, as well as dozens of moderate V1s-V3s. The most difficult problems V7 and greater, will challenge even the most advanced climbers. No ropes are needed in this endeavor, but all climbers must possess nimbleness, dexterity, and a strong grip.        Boulder climbers scaling several boulders at the park's Boulder Field.   The more difficult problems are often overhanging, which can be a true test of a climber’s dexterity and willingness to ascend a rock face that is largely lacking in features. The intense nature of bouldering at Obed WSR is in direct contrast to the calm and peaceful area of the boulderfield, a shady forest of hemlocks and hardwoods. The cool breezes and chirping birds do not adequately prepare a climber for the strains and struggles that the boulderfield presents.   The challenge is in the doing...and in the conquering of a segment of nature. If you plan to do some bouldering at Obed, always climb with a friend who can support you as you climb, and always use a crash pad.",
