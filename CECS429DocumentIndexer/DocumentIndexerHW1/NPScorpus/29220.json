The cool waters found here are famous as a natural and fun way to cool down in the summer heat.      SWIM SAFE!  The American Red Cross and the staff of Chickasaw National Recreation Area encourages all visitors to keep water activities safe and fun by remembering these safety tips:   Choose a safe place for water activities.     There are no lifeguards on duty; all swimming is at your own risk. Small children and non-swimmers should wear Coast Guard approved life jackets; some areas have sudden drop offs. Stay within reach of children. Don't swim alone. If you swim from a boat, make sure the boat is anchored. Never start the engine while swimmers are overboard. Water activities and alcohol do not mix. Many drownings are alcohol-related and can be prevented by not drinking alcoholic beverages before or during water sports. Know local weather conditions and how to find out what is forecasted.     Know how to prevent, recognize and care for hypothermia & heat emergencies.   Enter water feet first rather than head first if the depth is unknown.   Know your swimming limits.   Do not try to keep up with someone with stronger skills or ask others to keep up with you.   Watch for the \"dangerous too's\"- too tired, too cold, too far from safety or too much sun.   Protect your skin with a high rating sunscreen, such as 15, which protects against both UVB and UVA rays. Reapply often.
