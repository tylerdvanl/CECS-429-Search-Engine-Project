Some of the more common mammals are white-tailed deer, raccoon, and gray squirrel. Keep a sharp eye open and you may also see some of the smaller animals of the park such as a pine vole, eastern chipmunk or a cottontail. Some types of animals are seen less often such as the coyote or red fox. Depending on the time of day you might catch a glimpse of a little brown bat helping to control insects.
