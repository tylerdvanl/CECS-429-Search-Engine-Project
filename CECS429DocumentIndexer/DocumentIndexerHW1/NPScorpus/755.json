The Island of Hawai'i is the largest island in the United States, it contains no interstate highways, speed limits are never over 55mph (usually only 35-45mph) and traffic can often be backed up during peak travel hours.  Planning for the Unexpected Be aware that military convoys, triathlons, road construction and special community events (parades, festivals, etc) can often cause traffic to come to a standstill. It is also advisable to check public transportation schedules ahead of time and to book car\/van rentals well in advance. Some visitors arrive on the Island only to find that all the Island's rental vehicles are already reserved.",
