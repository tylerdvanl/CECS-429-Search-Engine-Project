They have adapted to lightless, low-energy environments by ceasing to grow eye structures and unnecessary skin pigments. Surface fish include most game fish found in the eastern United States, including bluegill, crappie, largemouth bass, muskellunge, yellow perch, striped bass, gar, and catfish, among others.
