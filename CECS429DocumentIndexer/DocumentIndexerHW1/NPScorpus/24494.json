    "body": "The Heart of the World  Colorado National Monument preserves one of the grand landscapes of the American West. But this treasure is much more than a monument. Towering monoliths exist within a vast plateau and canyon panorama. You can experience sheer-walled, red rock canyons along the twists and turns of Rim Rock Drive, where you may spy bighorn sheep and soaring eagles.                Proposed Entrance Fee Increase   Colorado National Monument is asking for public comments on proposed increases to entrance fees.        Entrance Passes Now Available On-line   Visitors can now pre-purchase annual and seven day passes for Colorado National Monument.
