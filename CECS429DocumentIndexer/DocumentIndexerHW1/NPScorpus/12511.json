    "body": "Resource Management Reports & Publications       REDWOOD CREEK The Redwood Creek Integrated Watershed Strategy (PDF, 3.6 MB) was prepared by the Redwood Creek Watershed Group. Membership includes private landowners, and local and federal agencies that manage more than 90 percent of the Redwood Creek watershed. Membership also includes non-profit organizations and agencies with regulatory or scientific interest in the watershed. The goal of the Redwood Creek Integrated Watershed Strategy is to improve and protect water quality, water supply, and aquatic and riparian habitat throughout the Redwood Creek watershed, including the estuary and coastal areas. The Redwood Creek Watershed Analysis (PDF, 1.2 MB) was prepared by Redwood National and State Parks in 1997 using the North West Forest Plan methodology. The analysis identifies natural resource issues in the Redwood Creek watershed, including: the protection of streamside redwoods; protection and restoration of aquatic habitat, and; protection of threatened and endangered species. The analysis presents a sediment budget for Redwood Creek for the period of 1954-1980. Upper Redwood Creek Watershed Road Assessment Update (PDF, 53.5 MB) was prepared by Redwood National and State Parks for the landowners in the Redwood Creek watershed, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the Pacific Coast Fish, Wildlife and Wetlands Restoration Association. It reports and analyzes data from road assessments completed between 1996 and 2004. There are about 1,116 miles of road upstream of the park in the upper Redwood Creek watershed. Road assessments evaluated 723 miles, or about 65 percent of all roads. Analysis methods provide examples of how roads and sub-watersheds can be prioritized for treatment using road assessment data. A watershed improvement plan describes management activities that can improve watershed conditions in Redwood Creek.
