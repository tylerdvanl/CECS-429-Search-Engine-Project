Following the nearly disastrous \"Pig War\" crisis of 1859 the Royal Navy's mission with their U.S. Army counterparts was keeping the peace on an island considered ripe for the taking by Britons and Americans alike. Drawing on historical, archaeological and photographic research, Outpost of Empire: The Royal Marines and the Joint Occupation of San Juan Island offers an intriguing glimpse of a frontier garrison in the Victorian age.
