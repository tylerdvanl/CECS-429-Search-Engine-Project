VIPs (Volunteers-In-Parks) work in various capacities. VIPs do everything from black powder demonstrations in living history events, to providing visitor services at the front desk. Others assist in the library and museum collection, researching, doing general office tasks, and helping with site and equipment maintenance. All positions are important. Besides looking great on a resume, volunteering at the Fort Smith National Historic Site is enjoyable and leaves a lasting sense of accomplishment to all involved. No experience is necessary - only a desire to help preserve and protect America's natural and cultural heritage for the enjoyment of this and future generations. Volunteers are needed year-round and training is provided; along with uniforms for volunteers who work with the public.
