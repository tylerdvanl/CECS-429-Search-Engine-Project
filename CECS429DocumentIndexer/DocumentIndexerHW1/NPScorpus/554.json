When Moses and Susan Carver moved to Southwest Missouri they built a small 12' x 12' cabin. Eventually that same cabin was inhabited by an enslaved girl named Mary. She gave birth to George towards the end of the Civil War. Today visitors can see the approximate area where the cabin once stood. A log layout was built after the establishment of the park.
