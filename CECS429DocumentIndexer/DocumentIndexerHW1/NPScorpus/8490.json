    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Permits & Reservations     Special Use Permits                Special Use Permits       The Special Use Permit (SUP) program authorizes activities that provide benefit to an individual, group or organization, rather than the public at large, and that require written authorization and some management control in order to protect park resources and the public interest. Examples include parking, special events, commercial filming\/still photography, weddings, scattering of ashes, group camping, First Amendment activities, and constructing a temporary Duck Blind.  Businesses seeking to operate commercial visitor services within the park should refer to the Doing Business with the Park webpage.    Special Use Permits are granted for specific periods of time and specific locations. Certain cost recovery, fees, and insurance requirements may apply. All though some permits, such as parking, can be completed quickly, most permits need time to be evaluated, processed, completed, and signed by both parties.  Allow at least two weeks (10 business days) for processing. Requests which involve multiple locations, complex logistics or coordination with other visitor activities will require a minimum of 15 working days to process. Projects which require environmental or cultural resource evaluation must be submitted not less than 30 days before the start of proposed activities. NOTE:  purchasing a permit, of any kind, in person or via telephone will only be available from 9:00 am until 3:30 pm, Monday through Friday excluding federal holidays.
