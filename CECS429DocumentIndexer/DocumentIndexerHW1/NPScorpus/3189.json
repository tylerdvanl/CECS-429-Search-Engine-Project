Actually, Saguaro National Park is in two separate worlds in terms of fire. In the desert, below about 4,500 feet elevation, historically fire played almost no role. The sparse grasses and forbs in the desert rarely allowed fire to spread. However, as elevation increases, temperatures moderate and rainfall increases. Above about 4,500 feet grasses and forbs increase in abundance, eventually creating continuous ground cover that can support fire spread.

The burns are thoroughly planned and carefully executed under specified conditions. Much of our prescribed burning is done to reduce vegetation that fuels fires, and to return fire to areas where fire had been suppressed in the past.          Managing Wildfire   1 Photos  Fire management at Saguaro is a complex art, ranging from suppression in the cactus forest to careful management in the high country woodlands.",
