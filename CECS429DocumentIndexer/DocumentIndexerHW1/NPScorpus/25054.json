Backpacks filled with art supplies can be checked out for free from the Exit Glacier Nature Center during the summer months. Art for Parks is a perfect activity for the whole family or for anyone wanting to explore their creative spirit in Kenai Fjords National Park. You can share a photograph of your artwork to be featured on the park website. Just ask a ranger for an artwork release form when you return the backpack.",
