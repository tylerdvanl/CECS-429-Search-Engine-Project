    "body": "Weather       Big Cypress National Preserve experiences two predominant seasons- wet and dry. RAINY SEASON (May through October) Seasonal rains bring higher water levels to Big Cypress, causing wildlife such as alligators and wading birds to disperse and to be seen less frequently. Mosquito levels may become high, and exploring trails in some areas of the preserve can become intolerable. While visiting during this season you may find daily afternoon thunderstorms, high humidity, temperatures in the mid - to - high 80s and a multitude of mosquitoes. During this time of year you will also find an array of flowering plants in bloom, views of towering storm clouds and opportunities to experience the preserve with fewer visitors. Remember, during the rainy season mosquitoes may be unbearable in some areas. DRY SEASON (November through April) While some birds are drawn to the preserve year round, the abundance of migrating and wintering birds makes the area a birder's paradise during the dry season. Falling water levels within the Big Cypress result in abundant wildlife concentrated in ponds and canals, providing excellent viewing opportunities. The dry season is the busy season in south Florida's national parks. Most visitors to Big Cypress come between December and March. During months of higher visitation campgrounds may be busy. Larger crowds, fewer mosquitoes, greater wildlife viewing opportunities and more enjoyable hiking, camping and canoeing adventures characterize this time of year. Finally, the Preserve offers a greater variety and number of ranger-led activities that provide an in-depth look into the special natural and cultural resources protected in the area.  Â     Taking seasonal changes into consideration and planning ahead are the best ways to take advantage of recreational opportunities. Choosing what time of year to visit, based on your interests, can be the key to an enjoyable trip. A hat, comfortable clothing and sturdy walking shoes or boots are necessary for anyone planning to hike. Hikers must always carry plenty of water. One gallon per person per day is recommended. Contact the Preserve at 239-695-4758, or 239-695-1201 for information on current weather conditions.",
