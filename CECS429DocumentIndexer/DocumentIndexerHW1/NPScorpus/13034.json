Nearly all amphibians live the first part of their lives in water and the second part on land. These creatures can be categorized into three main groups: frogs and toads, salamanders and caecilians. Frogs and toads are the most abundant amphibians, frogs having soft skin and longs legs, toads having warty skin and short legs. Salamanders, with their long, slender, lizard-like bodies are next in population size. The Caecilians are the most rare amphibians. They have no limbs and look much like earthworms. Most live underground and spend their time burrowing in the soil, but a few are aquatic.During the 2000-2001 Reptiles and Amphibians survey at the battlefield, the following amphibians were documented:Long-tailed SalamanderNorthern Dusky SalamanderNorthern Slimy SalamanderNorthern Two-lined SalamanderRedback SalamanderBullfrogEastern American ToadGreen FrogNorthern Spring PeeperPickerel FrogWood Frog",
