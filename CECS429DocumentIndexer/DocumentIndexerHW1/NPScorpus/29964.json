The information scientists and National Park Service staff have collected on Fire Island and at the William Floyd Estate was used to inform the Seashore's White-tailed Deer Management Plan and Environmental Impact Statement (Deer Plan\/EIS) and is summarized by topic below:  Vegetation Studies White-tailed Deer Population Studies Fertility Control Research White-tailed Deer Movement Study Studies of Human-Deer Interactions 4-Poster Tick Management Technology Study        Sunken Forest understory vegetation, the low-growing wildflowers and seedlings that live under the canopy of the trees, in 1967 (left) and in 2002 (center). Herbivore exclosures (right) allow researchers to monitor seedling establishment in Fire Island's rare maritime holly forests. Impacts of browsing by white-tailed deer threaten the regeneration of old growth American holly trees in the Sunken Forest.        Vegetation Studies on Fire Island  One of the earliest reports on the vegetation of Fire Island's Sunken Forest was provided by Robert Cushman Murphy in his 1933 article for Natural History Magazine, August on Fire Island Beach. In 1953, Oakleigh Thorne, II, provided additional documentation of vegetation in The Sunken Forest of Fire Island Beach, N.Y., his master's thesis for Yale University. Thorne documented the preservation and establishment of the Sunken Forest Preserve, which became a major component of Fire Island National Seashore when the park was established in 1964. In 1967, the National Park Service established permanent vegetation plots in the Sunken Forest to measure long-term changes. These plots were resurveyed in 1986, 2002, 2011, and 2015. More than forty years of vegetation studies in Fire Island's Sunken Forest reveal an alarming reduction in the number of herbaceous and woody plants in the understory of this globally rare maritime holly forest. Scientists are concerned that the climax forest is no longer able to sustain itself. Canopy trees such as the old growth American holly and sassafras, shadblow and black gum are no longer found growing in the understory at densities high enough to support regeneration of this maritime forest.

Brian Underwood, 2006  Back to Top      Deer Population Studies  In preparation of Fire Island National Seashore's 1978 general management plan, an island-wide aerial census was conducted in 1971, and 46 deer were observed. From 1983 to 1998 Seashore staff conducted an aerial count of deer twice each year. In 1985 Seashore staff initiated a study of deer home range, movements, physiological parameters, and incidence of Lyme disease in ticks. By 1989 the deer population on Fire Island was estimated at 500 individuals. By the mid-1990s deer had become abundant within the Fire Island communities. In 1995 the U.S. Geological Survey recommended distance sampling as a new ground-based method of estimating deer abundance. Initial distance sampling surveys within Fire Island communities estimated a density of 80 deer\/km2.  National Park Service lands on Fire Island and other areas within communities were added to the annual distance sampling survey effort by 1999, and continue today. Each year during the fall, Fire Island National Seashore staff carry out distance sampling.

Back to Top      Deer Fertility Control Research on Fire Island: 1993-2009  In 1993 the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) initiated a research project in the Fire Island communities (Kismet to Lonelyville) to determine whether they could remotely administer an immunocontraceptive vaccine - porcine zona pellucida (PZP) –to free-ranging white-tailed deer and test its efficacy in blocking fertilization in individual deer. The data gathered during the first five years showed positive results from Kismet to Lonelyville. In 1998 the study expanded geographically to include other communities and National Park Service lands on Fire Island. During the second phase (1998-2002) and third phase (2003-2009) of the project the principal goal was to demonstrate a population-level reduction of white-tailed deer on Fire Island.  Fire Island National Seashore began participating in this long-term research project in 1998, working cooperatively with HSUS, the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY ESF), and several Fire Island communities. Each fall from 1998 to 2009, the Seashore used bait stations to draw deer into appropriate areas, where female deer could be darted with PZP. Population-level information (deer density) was also collected annually to evaluate the effectiveness of PZP.  The second and third phases of this long-term study did not show PZP to be effective at all study sites and impacts to critical resources, such as the Sunken Forest, continued to be documented through vegetation monitoring during the study. The results of this long-term fertility control study were used to inform the development of Fire Island National Seashore's Deer Management Plan.  Rutberg, A.T. and Naugle, R.E.

Back to Top      White-tailed Deer Movement Study: 2014 - 2016 In 2014 the National Park Service, in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey and the State University of New York School of Environmental Science and Forestry, began a White-tailed Deer Movement Study on Fire Island. In phases over the course of three years, researchers will fit female deer with small, GPS-enabled radio-collars to track how the deer move about the island.

Back to Top      Studies of Human-Deer Interactions: 2003 - 2007  Fire Island community residents and residents adjacent to the William Floyd Estate participated in a 2003 study in which they were interviewed (or completed a mail survey) to better understand their perceptions of and concerns about deer. The primary concerns were related to impacts associated with the deer population size and density, home range and movements, and behavior. Impacts on residents include damage to landscaping and gardens, concerns about disease and ticks, sanitation issues, wildlife viewing opportunities, concerns about deer health, and deer interactions with pets. Residents were also concerned about impacts on deer such as habitat loss and behavior changes.

Deer play an indirect role in the transmission of Lyme disease to people because they serve as a primary host to ticks. From 2008 - 11, two 4-Poster Tick stations were placed within two Fire Island communities. These stations, filled with corn, were used to study the effect of the pesticide, Permethrin, on tick abundance. In order to feed at a station, deer pass their head and neck through rollers that applied the pesticide. Regular tick \"drags\" were carried out in the immediate vicinity to monitor the number of ticks.  In 2012 the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation registered 4-Poster Tickicide and approved its use for tick management in Nassau and Suffolk Counties.
