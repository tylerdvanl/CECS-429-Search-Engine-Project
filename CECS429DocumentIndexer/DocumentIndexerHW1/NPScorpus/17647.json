NPS received public comments on the Proposed Rule for Dog Management in the GGNRA from February 25 through May 25, 2016.  These comments will play an important role in the development of the final plan and rule, which are expected later this year.  Click here to learn more about the Proposed Rule. Dog Walking in the GGNRA    Walking your dog in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area (GGNRA) is a fun, healthy, and popular way to enjoy and explore parklands. There are many trails, beaches, and open spaces where dogs and their owners are welcome to visit both on and off leash. During this planning process while the park is developing a new regulation for dog walking in GGNRA, the current status of dog walking, both on leash or under voice control, will continue.
