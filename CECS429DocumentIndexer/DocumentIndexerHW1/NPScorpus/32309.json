    "body": "Trees and Shrubs        Trees, such as these London sycamores that line the park's parking area, provide much appreciated shade during the hot, dry summer months. NPS       Whitman Mission National Historic Site is located in what was once an extensive grassland. Except for in the mountains, trees would have been relatively few and found mostly next to streams and rivers. When the Whitmans came they wanted trees. Dr. Whitman wrote to friends back east asking for locust, chestnut, and walnut seeds. Narcissa obtained sprouts of apple and peach trees from Fort Vancouver. Today the trees the Whitmans planted are long gone. But people still love trees. Landscapers planted many trees and shrubs on the park grounds to add beauty and provide shade. An apple orchard was created to represent the one planted by Dr. Whitman. Below is a list of trees and shrubs found in the park along with some of the places where they can be seen.      Maple Family  Silver Maple (Acer saccharinum) - behind Visitor Center Red Maple (Acer rubrum) - along path from Visitor Center to Great Grave and in picnic area Norwegian Maple (Acer platanoides) - along path from Visitor Center to Great Grave and in picnic area       Rose Family  Wild Rose (Rosa eglanteria) - along re-constructed Oregon Trail ruts Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.) - along path from Visitor Center to mission grounds Crab Apple (Malus spp.) - east entrance of Visitor Center and in parking oval Domestic Apple (Malus domestica) - orchard near First House       Willow Family  Willow (Salix spp.) - between First House and Grist Mill Silver Poplar (Populus alba) - in Tipi Grove Eastern Cottonwood (Populus deltoides) - near First House and pond       Sycamore Family  American Sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) - near Mill Pond London Sycamore (Platanus x acerifolia) - parking lot       Pea Family  Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) - mission grounds, base of hill, and parking oval       Elm Family  Siberian Elm (Ulmus pumila) - Pioneer Cemetery and south side of hill Elm (Ulmus spp.) - base of hill near Alice Clarissa's marker       Hydrangea Family  Mock Orange (Philadelphus lewisii) - junction of re-constructed Oregon Trail ruts and path to mission grounds       Olive Family  Black Ash (Fraxinus nigra) - east entrance of Visitor Center Common Lilac (Syringa vulgaris) -Pioneer Cemetery       Dogwood Family  Dogwood (Cornus spp.) - parking oval       Elderberry Family  Blue Elderberry (Sambucus cerulea) - picnic area, base of hill, and along entrance road to park       Cashew Family  Staghorn Sumac (Rhus typhina) - picnic area Sumac (Rhus spp.) - near Mill Pond       Walnut Family  English Walnut (Juglans regia) - near First House       Ailanthus Family  Tree-of-Heaven (Ailanthus altissima) - Great Grave and Tipi Grove       Conifers  Blue Spruce (Picea pungens) - parking oval",
