But until recently, otters had not found their way into Glacier Bay. Now that has changed - presenting the National Park Service with a unique opportunity to understand more about the effect of the otters' return on the ecosystem.      Rapid population growth Since 1995 when the first five otters were observed in Glacier Bay, the population has grown to an estimated 8,000 individuals. Most of these animals are concentrated in lower reaches of the Bay. Sea otters consume large quantities of clams, mussels, crabs and other invertebrates, some of which are commercially, culturally or ecologically important. Scientists have long known that increased predation on these species can cause long-term changes that ripple through the ecosystem.      Reproduction Alaska sea otters typically bear their pups in late spring ― one pup per breeding cycle. But, depending on the availability of food, breeding may occur every other cycle. Pups weigh only a few pounds at birth, typically 3-5 pounds (1.4-2.3 kg) and are light brown. They live on top of their mothers, literally, until they are weaned. That's where they eat, sleep and how they travel, although otters usually don't roam far, unless they've run out of food.      Threats Many sea otters live15–20 years. Orcas are a primary predator of adult otters, and newborn otters are sometimes preyed upon by bald eagles.The greatest threat to the sea otter remains humans. It has been estimated that the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill caused the deaths of more than 2500 sea otters. Otters are also caught in fishing nets, and hunted for subsistence by Alaskan Natives.      Otter Research in Glacier Bay: Return to Glacier Bay James Bodkin                 Sort By: Rating Relevance Recently Updated Title    Show 10 40  per page     Loading results...
