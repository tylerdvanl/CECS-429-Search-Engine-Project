    "body": "Explore This Park    Learn About the Park     Nature     Environmental Factors               Environmental Factors       The Big Thicket Region of Texas is a fascinating conglomeration of long ago and current environmental factors that have all contributed to the diverse array of plants, animals, and natural features encountered here. The glacial periods of long ago pushed animals into the area who have never left. Being on the edge of several major ecosystem types and having ample rain coming up from the Gulf has allowed all of the associated plant communities to co-exist. Fires lit by lightening, Native Americans, early settlers, and now land managers have created and attempt to maintain fire dependent plant community types. Hurricanes, tornadoes, longer-term droughts, and occasional artic blasts from the north al continue to insert their influence on the plants and animals. The predicted outcomes from ongoing climate change including rising sea levels and changes in precipitation may also lead to larger scale environmental changes.",
