    "body": "Explore This Park    Get Involved     Support Your Park             Support Your Park       The National Park Service cares for America's treasures and you can help.  Be a good park visitor. Take nothing but photographs, leave nothing but footprints. Enjoy yourself and remember future visitors who will come after you hoping to enjoy these American treasures too. Support stewardship of the park by becoming educated about the park's natural and cultural resources.  Be a volunteer! There's nothing more rewarding than warm thanks from visitors whom you helped connect to the park and its resources! Give a gift that will directly benefit the park. Support the park's bookstores. Park bookstores run by Eastern National donate a share of their proceeds to help fund exhibits and programs.   Keep informed on park issues and provide comment during park planning processes. Be a good steward by obeying park regulations including, but not limited to: picking up trash; keeping dogs leashed; leaving precious resources undisturbed; and not harassing park wildlife.",
