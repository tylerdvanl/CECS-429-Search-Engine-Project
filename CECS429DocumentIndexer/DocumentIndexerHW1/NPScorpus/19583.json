    "body": "Explore This Park    Get Involved     Volunteer     Internships              Historical Interpreter Internship       An internship with Andersonville National Historic Site provides an unforgettable, invaluable experience. Park interns work on the \"front lines\" of history by serving the public and sharing the past with modern visitors, fine-tuning both their research and presentation skills. Our internship program, supported in part by the Friends of Andersonville, is an excellent opportunity for students and recent graduates to apply knowledge learned in the classroom, gain experience, meet professionals in the field, and often to determine which aspect of their chosen field is of greatest interest.The Historical Interpreter Interns work at the museum information desk, and lead programs at the National Prisoner of War Museum, in the Civil War prison site or in Andersonville National Cemetery. Housing may be available for interns traveling from outside of the local commuting area. Summer interns can expect to work 5 days a week. Weekend work will be required. Positions are unpaid, although the park provides a cost of living stipend for one internship. Internship applications are accepted on a continuous basis, and interested individuals are encouraged to submit applications early. Please Note: Our summer residential intern position for the summer of 2014 is presently filled. Other time periods may be available. To apply for an internship please either send our application as an attachment via e-mail or print it and mail to the address below. Internship applications or resumes and cover letters may be sent to the Chief of Interpretation & Education at: Andersonville National Historic Site, 496 Cemetery Road, Andersonville, GA 31711.   Â     Internships are very different from the temporary employees hired annually by the National Park Service over the summer.
