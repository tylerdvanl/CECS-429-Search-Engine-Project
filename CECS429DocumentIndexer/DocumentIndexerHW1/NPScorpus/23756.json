    "body": "Hiking in Bandelier         Hikes vary in length and difficulty.  Plan your trip, take plenty of water, and watch for wildlife. Photo by Sally King  Bandelier National Monument has over 70 miles of trail within its boundaries and many more miles that connect out into the adjacent Santa Fe National Forest Lands. The most popular of these trails are the Main Loop Trail and Alcove House Trail (click here for more information) which are accessed from the visitor center in Frijoles Canyon. These trails take you to many Ancestral Pueblo sites. The Falls Trail is another trail that is very popular (click here for more information). It takes you to a beautiful waterfall. Before the flash floods of 2011 the trail continued to the Lower Falls and ultimately to the Rio Grande. Flooding destroyed the trail leaving no access to the Rio Grande from Frijoles Canyon. There are no archeological sites on this trail. Bandelier also offers opportunities for much longer hikes (click here for more information). Permits are available for overnight stays in much of Bandelier's backcountry (click here for more information).       With its range of elevations, Bandelier offers hikes with archeological sites, wildlife, and panoramic views.
