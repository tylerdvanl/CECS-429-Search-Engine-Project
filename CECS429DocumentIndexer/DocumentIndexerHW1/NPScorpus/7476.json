    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility             Accessibility       Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area is a spectacular landscape that can present difficult challenges for visitors with special needs. Improvements in accessibility are being made each year and with a bit of pre-planning, all visitors can find Bighorn Canyon to be a rewarding experience. North District: Yellowtail Dam Visitor Center and the Afterbay Contact Station, Fort Smith, Montana, are handicapped accessible.  Due to National Security Issues, tours of the dam and access to the top of the dam are not available at this time.  South District: Bighorn Canyon Visitor Center in Lovell, Wyoming is fully accessible including a nature trail encompassing the reflection pond behind the building. Crooked Creek Contact Station is also fully accessible. (Disabled Access: For those who have a permanent disability and would like to access one of the historic ranches, please call Jim Staebler at the Bighorn Canyon Visitor Center at 307-548-5406 at least 48 hours in advance to arrange your visit.) A good place to look for the latest information on accessibility is the Disabled Traveler's Companion Website. While not officially affiliated with the National Park Service, they have been working with other National Parks and provide valuable information to the disabled traveler. Their website contains information that will aid in planning your trip to the National Parks.",
