    "body": "Replacement Adobes       Due to moisture from rainwater wicking up into the adobe blocks at the foundation of the church, and other aging and deteriorating factors, it is necessary to replace some of the adobes from time to time. Although Tumacácori's preservation crew has modern mixers, wheel barrows, and other equipment, it is still a back-breaking process to make the adobe blocks in the traditional wooden molds and stack them for sun drying.       Photo by Jana Tschopp        Photo by Jana Tschopp        NPS Photo by David Yubeta        Photo by Jana Tschopp",
