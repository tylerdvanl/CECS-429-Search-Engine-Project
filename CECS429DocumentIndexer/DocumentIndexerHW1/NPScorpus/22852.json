    "body": "Self-Guided       Teachers wanting to facilitate their own field trips need to fill out a program request and academic fee waiver. Reservations are required to allow us to better facilitate your requests and minimize resource damage.   Rangers are available to give a 15-minute welcome talk, which orients students to Colorado National Monument, the National Park Service and Leave No Trace ethics. Ranger welcome talks are strongly recommended at the beginning of your self-guided field trip.
