More than 150 miles of trails offer opportunities for day hikes or backpacking trips. Elevations range from 1,800 feet along the Rio Grande to 7,832 feet on Emory Peak in the Chisos Mountains. Elevation changes produce an exception variety of plants, animals, and scenic vistas. Generally, hikers can expect a 20°F temperature difference between low and high elevation hiking areas.        Mule Ears Peaks NPS Photo\/Blake Trester  Desert Hikes Desert trails range from short, easy nature walks to multi-day treks marked only by rock cairns, if at all. Remote routes provide a wilderness adventure for experienced hikers where silence and solitude are key protected resources.        Chisos ridgetop view NPS Photo\/Big Bend National Park  Mountain Hikes Rising 7832' in elevation, the Chisos Mountains preserve a relict forest of oaks, pines, junipers, madrones, and Arizona cypress. There are about twenty miles of trails within the Chisos with excellent year-round hiking opportunities.        View from Rio Grande Village Nature Trail NPS Photo\/Cookie Ballou  River Hikes Dense stands of reeds and mesquite thickets line the river along much of the park boundary making human access difficult, but providing excellent habitat for wildlife. The best way to enjoy this area is from the river itself, but several short hikes provide access into river canyons or elsewhere along its banks.",
