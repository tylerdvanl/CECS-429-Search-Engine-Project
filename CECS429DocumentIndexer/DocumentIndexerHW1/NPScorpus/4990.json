Dependent on river corridor habitats and fisheries are mammals, reptiles and amphibian--some of which are listed as threatened or endangered. The many land and vegetation communities of the lower Delaware River corridor not only provide for diverse landscapes, but also provide diverse habitats for fish and wildlife. The lower Delaware River corridor is filled with dramatic geological contrasts. High, rocky gorges, steep bluffs and dry ridgelines contrast in sharp relief with dense forests, wetlands, and river islands, producing diverse and unique landscapes within a relatively small geographic region.",
