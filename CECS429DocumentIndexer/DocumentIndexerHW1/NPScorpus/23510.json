The trail through Chetro Ketl is ½ mile, roundtrip. It is graveled, and climbs several short, steep rises, so assistance is recommended for people using wheel chairs. When you visit Chetro Ketl, you can use the trail guide to help you recognize characteristics of Chacoan architecture--features that are both typical and unique. Chetro Ketl is the second largest Chacoan great house. It covers more than 3 acres, and contains a great kiva and elevated kivas. As builders constructed second and third stories, they created an elevated plaza that stands 12 feet above the valley floor.         Chetro Ketl from the mesa top         Chetro Ketl at night Tyler Nordgren PhD",
