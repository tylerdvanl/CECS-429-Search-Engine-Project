While at Great Basin National Park, Bain studied Great Basin Bristlecone Pines in the context of that metaphor. After receiving a MD from the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Bain went on to pursue painting, receiving an MFA at New York Academy of Art. He is a successful artist, approaching his subjects with meticulous care, and has his work in multiple publications.  He was named a semi-finalist in the 2009 Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery. For more information about the artist visit www.bainbutcher.com",
