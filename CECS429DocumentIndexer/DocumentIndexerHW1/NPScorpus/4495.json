Learn more about our diving and snorkeling sites.   Remember to not disturb coral or shells. All coral, living and dead, is protected from collection. Shipwrecks and all historic artifacts are protected by law. You  must display an approved dive flag when snorkeling outside of the designated snorkel area.  For your safety never snorkel alone.
