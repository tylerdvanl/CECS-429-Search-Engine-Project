Hunting is permitted within the national lakeshore in accordance with federal migratory bird laws and federal and State of Michigan regulations. Along with fishing, hunting is an activity specifically allowed by the Congress of the United States when it authorized Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore in 1966.   Hunting site bulletin (pdf)      Hunting Opportunities With its varied topography, lakes, streams, and mixed coniferous and hardwood forest, Pictured Rocks provides habitat for a variety of game animals.   Most hunting activities are for white-tailed deer, grouse, woodcock, bear, and snowshoe hare. Whether the method is archery, muzzle loading, or firearms, hunters find ample hunting opportunities from grown-over farm fields to backcountry cedar swamps.  The hunting season begins in mid-September with bear and grouse seasons and continues through the winter with snowshoe hare season. Refer to your \"Michigan Hunting Guide\" for specific dates and bag limits. A Michigan hunting license is required, and is available in local communities. Appropriate waterfowl stamps (state and federal) may also be required.  Hunting dogs are permitted during legal hunting seasons when accompanied by a licensed hunter, and may travel unrestrained in all backcountry and non-developed areas of the lakeshore.  However, dog training within the park prior to hunting season is NOT permitted.    When not actively engaged in hunting, dogs must be restrained on a six-foot leash.  State hunting regulations apply in the use of dogs for hunting. Please review information concerning Pets at the lakeshore.       Your Safety and Resource Protection Hunters need to be especially safety conscious because many people enjoy recreational activities within the lakeshore from camping to cross-country skiing. The lakeshore is also home to many non-game birds and mammals. Be a safe, responsible hunter - know your target.  While carrying a firearm, all hunters must wear hunter orange that is at least 50% of the garment.    Use caution because day hikers and backpackers also use the park during hunting seasons. Certain areas of the lakeshore are closed to hunting for public safety.   Whether game or non-game, common or endangered, all wildlife plays an important role in nature. They enrich the natural world and add to the pleasures of recreationists. Safe hunting practices and a sound conservation ethic help ensure these opportunities for the future. Protected wildlife include eagles, hawks, owls, non-game birds, wolves, lynx, moose, marten, fisher, cougar, and cub bears.  It is also unlawful to shoot turtles, frogs, and snakes.
