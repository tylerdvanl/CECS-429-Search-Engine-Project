There are ninety-six monuments at Antietam, the majority of which are Union. After the war, the former Confederacy was so devastated it was difficult for the veterans to raise the needed money to build monuments.   There are regimental monuments, state monuments and monuments to individuals. At Antietam, there were six generals killed or mortally wounded. The location of where these generals fell is marked by a mortuary cannon, an inverted cannon barrel in a block of stone. There is even a monument to war correspondents. Our monument pages also include monuments located on South Mountain at Fox's Gap and Crampton's Gap.
