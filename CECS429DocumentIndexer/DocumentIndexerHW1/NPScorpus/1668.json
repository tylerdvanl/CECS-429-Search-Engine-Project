NPS Photo   Are you a local student? Want to improve your resume, and America's outdoors at the same time?   We are starting an internship program for current, local, students who are looking for experience. Interns are required to work 12 hours a week for 12 weeks (including 2 weeks of training). At the end of the internship you will have developed something to contribute to the park!   It could be an interpretive hand-out, a public presentation, or a technical report that we can use for research and to improve management! Upon completion, you will earn a letter of recommendation from the National Park Service.   The possibilities are endless. We've already had an environmental engineer from Northern Arizona University (NAU) interning with maintenance and working on the historic irrigation canal at Montezuma Well!   Questions? Please contact our Volunteer Coordinator, Krystina Isaac, at 928-567-3322 x223. We look forward to working with you!",
