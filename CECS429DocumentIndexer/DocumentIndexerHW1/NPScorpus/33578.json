    "body": "Snakes       There are many snakes in Prince William Forest Park.  They are usually seen sunning themselves on the rocks along Quantico Creek or soaking up the warmth of the pavement on Scenic Drive. If you see a snake along Scenic Drive or along Quantico Creek, please do not attempt to touch or move the snake.  Whether walking or driving, please give the snake a wide berth and continue on your way. Here are some of the snakes of Prince William Forest Park.         Northern copperhead Andrew Hoffman  Northern Copperhead - poisonous Many snakes can vary greatly in coloration, and the copperhead is no exception. They can range anywhere from a bright orange to tan, and all the way to a very dark brown. Copperheads do not possess rattle, but they are known to flick their tail against dry leaves so quickly that it can easily sound like a rattle to a surprised hiker.        Timber rattlesnake on the defense Photo courtesy of Andrew Hoffman  Timber Rattlesnake - venomous The timber rattlesnake is a fairly large snake with a wide body and the distinctive rattle on its tail that serves as a warning device when it is threatened. Their coloration varies as well, but they are typically a dark brown with diamond like patterns on its back. Both of our venomous snake species will not aggressively pursue a human and use their bite as a last defense.        Andrew Hoffman  Northern Ringneck         Andrew Hoffman  Black Rat Snake        Andrew Hoffman  Eastern Garter Snake",
