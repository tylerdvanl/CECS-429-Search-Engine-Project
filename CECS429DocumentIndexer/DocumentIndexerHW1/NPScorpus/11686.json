Since time immemorial, vast numbers of elephant seals could be found breeding, molting, and rearing their young on the western seashores of North America. In the late 19th century American whalers hunted them to the point of near-extinction. The documentary describes how the recent resurgence of the elephant seal population at Point Reyes National Seashore and in the greater Pacific Ocean demonstrates the success of marine conservation laws and threatened species protections.

This disease, which has been killing Tanoak trees at an alarming rate, was first documented in Marin County in the mid-1990s and has since spread up and down the North American west coast. Sudden Oak Death documents the history of the disease, describes its pathology, and explains what measures may prevent its spread in the future.

Since pre-historic times, large herds of tule elk roamed California’s central valley and coastal plains. Unfortunately, they were hunted to near-extinction by the late 19th century. Tule Elk examines how the dramatic rebound of the tule elk population at Point Reyes National Seashore and in California at large demonstrates the success of threatened species protections and conservation laws.
