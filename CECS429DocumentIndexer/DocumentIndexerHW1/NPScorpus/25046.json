You can make a gift to benefit the park either directly to the National Park Service or to our primary non-profit, tax exempt partner, Alaska Geographic.  If you make the gift directly to Kenai Fjords, your donation will be used for interpretation, research and enhancing visitor experiences.  No administrative costs are deducted from your gift, when given directly to the National Park Service for use in Kenai Fjords. Your check will be deposited in a government account. Government accounts are non-interest bearing. To give directly to Kenai Fjords, please mail your check to:  Superintendent Kenai Fjords National Park PO Box 1727 Seward, AK 99664  The advantage of making your donation to Alaska Geographic is that the amount will be deposited in an interest-bearing account to assist projects or programs as requested and prioritized by Kenai Fjords' managers.
