    "body": "Climate Friendly Planning       Climate Friendly Parks In 2008, Fire Island National Seashore joined the Climate Friendly Parks Program (CFP). A collaboration of the National Park Service and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, this program provides national parks with comprehensive support, management tools and resources to address climate change both within park boundaries and in surrounding communities. The Climate Friendly Park program is expected to:  measure park-based greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions develop sustainable strategies to mitigate these emissions and to adapt to climate change impacts, and educate the public about these efforts.  In 2009, Fire Island National Seashore completed its CFP Action Plan, and has begun to initiate components within the park's means.      The Clean Marina Program initiated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is also expected to be implemented at Fire Island National Seashore in 2008.     In addition to the National Park Service operated marinas, there are municipal and privately owned marinas within the boundaries of the park on Fire Island.      Learn More You may learn more about climate change and its impact on National Parks around the country by perusing the following sites:    Climate Change in National Parks Global Climate Change and Sea-Level Rise   Relative Coastal Vulnerability Assessment of National Park Units to Sea-Level Rise   Relative Coastal Vulnerability Assessment of Fire Island National Seashore (FIIS) to Sea-Level Rise Vulnerability of National Park Service Beaches to Inundation During a Direct Hurricane Landfall",
