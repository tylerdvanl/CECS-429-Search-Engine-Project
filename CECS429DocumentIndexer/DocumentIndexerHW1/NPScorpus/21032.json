NPS Photo   Â    The San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) offers bus service throughout the county, including hourly stops daily, (Monday-Friday), at Cabrillo National Monument via Route 84. For added convenience, the bus stop is located right at the Visitor Center complex. Taking the bus to the park is a great choice to reduce congestion and pollution, and a relaxing way to enjoy the scenic road on top of Point Loma. Please note that the bus does not go to the tidepool area on the west side of the park.  For more information on Route 84, click here to access the Metropolitan Transit System website.",
