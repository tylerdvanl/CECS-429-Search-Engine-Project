The closure is expected to last through all of 2016, and is necessary to ensure the safety of visitors. The rehabilitation project will help to preserve the historic house and the museum collections normally displayed on­site by replacing the failing metal roof and improving the fire suppression system. The rehabilitation will be done in a manner consistent with the historic significance of the house. In preparation, the historic furnishings and many collection items were moved last fall to a state-of-the-art museum collections facility in Maryland. For updates on construction and additional information about Clara Barton and her work with the early American Red Cross please visit the website at www.nps.gov\/clba or call 301-­320-­1400       Clara Barton National Historic Site is administered by the George Washington Memorial Parkway and while you are visiting in the area, you may wish to visit one of the nearby sites. http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/gwmp\/index.htm",
