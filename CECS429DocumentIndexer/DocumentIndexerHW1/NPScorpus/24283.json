Â       Let's Move Outside Let's Move Outside, administered by the Department of Interior, was created to get kids and families to take advantage of America's great outdoors-which abound in every city, town and community. And together, these agencies oversee more than one-fifth of the nation's land - including millions of acres of National forests, parks and trails. Curecanti and Black Canyon are official Let's Move Outside parks. This means that special programs and incentives are offered encouraging children and their families to get outside and get active in these parks. Regular exercise in nature is proven to improve children's physical and mental health. Outdoor activity helps kids maintain a healthy weight, boosts their immunity and bone health and lowers stress.
