    "body": "Woodlands and Forests at Gateway       Each of Gateway's three units has a woodland or forest to explore. Sandy Hook has the largest holly forest in the northeastern United States. Great Kills Park on Staten Island hosts a stately white oak forest, while the former municipal airport at Floyd Bennett Field, Brooklyn offers a mixed woodland area. All are great places to see birds and explore trails. Safety Tips: Stay on the trails. Look out for poison ivy, which thrives in this region. Mosquitos like the forests too. Bring bug spray and use it beforehand. Finally, after your visit, check yourself for any unwanted critters such as ticks.",
