    "body": "Plants         NPS   Pipe Spring National Monument sits at about 5000 feet in elevation. High-desert grasses once covered the range around the monument as far as the eye could see. Then in the 1860s thousands of sheep and cattle were put on the range to take advantage of this sea of grass. Scarce rain and snow, combined with overgrazing, changed all the lives that had depended on the good grassâ€”for the worse.",
