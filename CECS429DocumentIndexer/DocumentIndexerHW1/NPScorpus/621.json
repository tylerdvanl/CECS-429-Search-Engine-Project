    "body": "Safety       Because it can be very hot and sunny, bring drinking water (or purchase it at the visitor center), sunscreen, a hat and sunglasses to protect yourself. Walking along the rocky coastline or accessing the tidepools can be physically challenging. The lava rocks are uneven, loose and are sometimes wet and slippery. Wear sturdy shoes and use common sense. The ocean can be unpredictable. Please obey any warnings that may be posted due to high surf, winds, or other dangers. Eels, which may bite and sea urchins that sting, live in the ocean and are sometimes found in the tidepools. Know these animals and respect their habitats. The nearest hospital is located in Kealakekua, approximately 8 miles north of the park on Hwy 11.",
