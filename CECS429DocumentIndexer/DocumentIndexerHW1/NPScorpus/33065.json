Through guided observation and sensory exploration, students will collect clues while they identify and compare shapes, patterns, and sounds of the forest to heighten their awareness of the diversity of the natural world.   Subject\/Keywords: Senses, Discovery, Observation, Shapes, Patterns, Sounds Grade Level: K-3 Location: Kautz Creek, Longmire Standards: LS1-1, ESS2-3, PS1-1  Habitats of Mount Rainier: There's No Place Like Home From the seedlings in the soil to birds on the branches, the forests of Mount Rainier support an abundance of life! Join a ranger and investigate an old growth forest habitat. Students will observe, describe, compare, and categorize both the living and the nonliving components of this special environment.   Subject\/Keywords: Habitat, Forest, Interdependence, Food Chain, Trees, Animal\/Plant Structures, Observations, Investigations, Life Zone, Biodiversity, Abiotic, Biotic Grade Level: 3-5 Location: Longmire, Ohanapecosh Standards: LS4, LS1, PS3-1  Locked in Rocks: Clues from the Past Geologists from around the world study the rocks, glaciers, and streams around Mount Rainier to gain insight into its volcanic past. Unlock the clues of the explosive history of Mount Rainier while learning about the anatomy of a volcano, the powerful forces behind an eruptions, and the movement and cooling of lava on a stratovolcano.   Subject\/Keywords: Volcanoes, Rocks, Earth Formation, Eruption, Erosion, Glaciers, Geology  Grade Level: 3-5 Location: Longmire Standards: PS2-3, ESS1-1, PS1-3  Glistening Glaciers and Raging Rivers: Watersheds of Mount Rainier At 14,410 feet Mount Rainier can make its own weather. Its powerful presence affects everything from the glaciers that crown its peak to the rivers that flow into the Puget Sound and on into the Pacific Ocean. Learn about these important watersheds from the summit to the sea and what we can do protect them.   Subject\/Keywords: Watersheds, Water Cycles, Weather, Climate, Glaciers, Rivers, Climate Change  Grade Level: 4-6 Location: Paradise Standards: ESS2  Survival Sleuths: Animal Adaptions Mount Rainier is a land of extremes from the frozen alpine summit to lush lowland forests. How do animals survive in this rugged environment? Students will learn about successful strategies, as well as the internal and external structures that allow animals to adapt and prosper in this environment.  Subject\/Keywords: Adaptions, Life Zones, Internal\/External Structures, Food Chain, Predator-Prey Relationships, Survival Strategies, Behavior  Grade Level: 4-6 Location: Longmire Standards: LS1-1, LS2  Warning - Signs of Hazards Ahead Mount Rainier, part of the Ring of Fire, is an active volcano and still emits signs of the activity beneath the Earth's crust. Past eruptions have caused substantial change to the landscape below and future activity will have a huge impact on hundreds of thousands of people in the Puget Sound region. Join a ranger to discover signs of past geologic events and disturbances that have occurred on the slopes of Mount Rainier. How can these signs help us prepare for the future?    Subject\/Keywords: Volcanism, Hazards, Catastrophic Events, Erosion, Eruption, Construction\/Destruction, Emergency Management  Grade Level: 4-6 Location: Longmire Standards: PS3, ESS2  The Powerful Forces of the Mountain The story of Mount Rainier is one of fire and ice, varied ecosystems linked by the rivers that flow from the mountain, and the incredible structures of plants and animals that allow them to survive, grow, and reproduce in this dynamic landscape. This program brings to life the geologic processes, glacier-fed watersheds, and unique adaptions necessary for life in the snowy subalpine environment.    Subject\/Keywords: Volcanism, Watersheds, Glacier, Life Zones, Communities  Grade Level: 4-8 Location: Paradise Standards: LS1, ESS1, ESS2, ESS3-2  Moving and Shaking: Weathering and Erosion on Mount Rainier Glaciers and rivers and lahars oh my! Through guided activities and a ranger-led hike, students will learn about the incredible forces of weathering and erosion that continue to sculpt the valleys and peaks of Mount Rainier.  Subjects\/Keywords: Weathering, Erosion, Glacier  Grade Level: 4-8 Location: Paradise Standards: LS1, ESS1, ESS2, ESS3-2   A Disturbingly Wild Story of Succession: Mount Rainier Investigation Mount Rainier's wild lands present unparalleled research opportunities to study the intricate relations between abiotic and biotic factors. In this science investigation students carry on the long-standing tradition of field research, unlock the mysteries of ecological disturbances, forecast the story of succession, and compare their results to current park research.   Subject\/Keywords: Investigation, Scientific Method, Disturbances, Erosion, Catastrophic Events, Abiotic, Biotic, Ecosystem Dynamics  Grade Level: 6-10 Location: Kautz Creek  Standards: LS2",
