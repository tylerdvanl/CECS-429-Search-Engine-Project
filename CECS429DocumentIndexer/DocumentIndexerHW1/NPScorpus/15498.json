    "body": "Bird Watching         Birding at the National Lakeshores Great Marsh. Jeffrey Manuszak  Located at the southern tip of Lake Michigan, the national lakeshore is an important feeding and resting area for migrating birds. Lake Michigan influences the migration patterns of bird species. During the fall migration, southbound birds follow the north-south shoreline and are funneled into the Indiana Dunes. The large expanse of open water and miles of shoreline also attract large numbers of wintering birds. The Indiana Dunes provides an excellent opportunity for birders to see a variety of bird species. Birders can observe hawks during migration from the top of a sand dune, watch waterfowl with a spotting scope from the shoreline, or look for wetland birds in remnant sections of the Great Marsh. Whether you have beginner or advanced identification skills, Indiana Dunes is a great place for birders.  The national lakeshore plays an important role in the annual Indiana Dunes Birding Festival, which take place in early May. This incredible four-day event showcases dozens of birding spots around the region with expert led outings.  Additional information about birds and bird watching around the Indiana Dunes can be found here.",
