    "body": "Explore This Park    Learn About the Park     Nature     Wildlife     Mammals     Gray Fox                  Gray Fox       The gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) is a common resident of Grand Canyon National Park. This small member of the dog family is an adept climber and may be seen up trees. They generally have home ranges from about 1-2 mi2 (2.5-5 km2) and are rarely seen outside forested areas. As nocturnal omnivores, they eat everything from small mammals like mice and rabbits to insects, fruits, and nuts and are usually only active after dusk and before dawn.      Identification:  To avoid confusing the gray fox with other mammals in the Grand Canyon, look for these characteristics:    Mostly-gray with black-tipped fur on back and tail.  Reddish coloration around face and neck.  2.5-3.5 ft (75-105 cm) body length.  7-15 lbs (3-7 kg) body weight.         Quick Facts about gray foxes:   These are the smaller of the two members of the dog family living in the park, the larger being the coyote.   Pups can begin foraging on their own at four months of age but usually stay with their mothers until around seven months. At 10 months of age, gray foxes become sexually mature and females will generally have a litter each year thereafter.",
