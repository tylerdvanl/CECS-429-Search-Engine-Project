Visitor Centers       American Camp Visitor Center The American Camp visitor center, located on Cattle Point Road on the island's southern peninsula, serves year-round as the primary contact station for the park.   English Camp Visitor Center The heart of English Camp is situated on the shoreline located below the main parking area, accessible from West Valley Road.                The ancient shell midden lying beneath the English Camp parade ground bakes the grass to a golden finish by August, while the formal garden continues to offer color. This is perhaps the most photographed view of the park's northern unit. Gary Tarleton Photo         You will find most, if not all, the information you seek at the American Camp visitor center, located off Cattle Point Road, five miles south of Friday Harbor. Gary Tarleton Photo  San Juan Island National Historical Park is composed of 2,141 acres of woodland, prairie and saltwater shoreline in two units on San Juan Island, one of the 172 named islands and reefs in San Juan County, Washington State. Unless you have your own water craft or airplane, the island is accessible only by Washington State Ferries and commercial air carriers. Be sure to make a reservation to ensure a spot on the ferries, especially during the summer season when only 10 percent of a boat's capacity is set aside for drive ups.  Both park units--American Camp and English Camp--despite their names, are day-use only. Camping is available at San Juan County Park and Lakedale Resort. Lodging is available in Friday Harbor, Roche Harbor Resort, Lakedale Resort and a number of bed and breakfast (B&Bs) scattered throughout the island. For an up-to-date list of lodging properties check the San Juan Islands Visitors Bureau web site.  Food service on the island is limited to Friday Harbor and the Roche Harbor (three miles north of English Camp), so ensure you eat first or pack a picnic lunch if you're visiting the park units around meal times.
