The problem is not unique to the park, and has increased in several states, likely a result of an expanding vulture population. Throughout Florida and elsewhere, vultures damage cars, roof shingles, and pool screens. We see this type of behavior quite a bit, especially in vehicle parking areas associated with water resources like Royal Palm and at boat ramps. Everglades National Park would like to minimize the damage vultures cause to the vehicles of our visitors. To that end, we are providing some suggested strategies for minimizing interactions. Additional resources are also available for those who wish to learn more.",
