    "body": "Springs and Seeps       There could be hundreds, if not thousands, of springs and seeps within the watershed of the Buffalo River. Large springs that have large outputs, such as Mitch Hill Spring and Gilbert Spring, have been monitored for water-quality for more than 10 years, and much is known about the quantity, quality, and the aquatic organisms that reside in these springs. These little islands of aquatic and mesic habitat could be home to endemic species of macroinvertebrates and vascular plants. Efforts to find, measure, and monitor many of these areas, are currently underway for the Upper District of the Buffalo National River. Results from this effort could help explain water-quality trends in tributary watersheds, document habitat for rare or endemic vascular plants, and help explain the geologic setting as specific strata layers produce springs.",
