Cape Cod National Seashore is excited to partner with Cape Cod Healthcare again in 2016 to promote ways in which the national seashore contributes to our physical and mental well-being under the national Healthy Parks, Healthy People program.  In July and August healthcare professionals will again be at Salt Pond Visitor Centers on weekdays from 8-11 AM helping park visitors and neighbors set and measure their personal wellness goals. In addition, rangers will offer programs that promote fitness and well-being, including beach yoga, long hikes, canoe trips, surfcasting, and family activities. Programs are listed in Park News and via this website's calendar page.
