    "body": "Elk & Vegetation Management Plan         Elk grazing in meadow.   Rocky Mountain National Park is implementing the Elk and Vegetation Management Plan. The plan relies on a variety of conservation tools including fencing, elk redistribution, vegetation restoration and culling. Authorized agents, including qualified volunteers may assist the National Park Service (NPS) in culling operations under the direct supervision of NPS personnel. In cooperation with Colorado Parks and Wildlife, Rocky Mountain National Park will occassionally seek to recruit and train a group of volunteers to be qualified for the park's elk culling project. Rocky Mountain National Park has adequate numbers of cull team volunteers so no applications are being accepted at this time.  Learn more about the requirements of becoming a volunteer Elk Cull Team Member.  Â    Based on current information Rocky Mountain National Park estimates elk numbers are near or within management objectives for the park's winter range.  Elk culling in Rocky Mountain National Park will not occur during the winter of 2014\/2015.  Therefore Colorado Parks and Wildlife will not conduct a lottery for distribution of elk carcasses and will not have elk meat available for the public through this program this year.",
