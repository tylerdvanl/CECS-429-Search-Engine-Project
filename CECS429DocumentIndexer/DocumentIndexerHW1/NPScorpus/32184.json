They are the sixth generation of the Leach family to operate Woodlawn Farm, which today milks 350 Holsteins and sells its registered stock around the world.  Â      Woodlawn Farm Jeffrey P. Roberts  Tim and Dot, along with many of their neighbors, have voluntarily sold the development rights to their land to the Vermont Land Trust in order to enhance the Farm's financial stability and preserve the agricultural heritage and rural character of the Mettowee Valley. Since its founding in 1977, the Land Trust has conserved nearly 200,000 acres of farm and forest land - roughly three and a half percent of Vermont's privately owned land.",
