    "body": "Do Business With Us       The National Park Service has selected DNC Parks and Resorts at Shenandoah, Inc., a subsidiary of Delaware North Companies, as the concessioner at Shenandoah National Park. Under the 10-year contract, which is projected to begin January 1, 2013, DNC will provide lodging, retail shops, food and beverage, and other commercial services to visitors throughout the park including at Skyland Resort and Big Meadows Lodge. The terms of the contract require several changes including increasing the number of rooms that meet ADA accessibility standards, removal of two fueling stations to improve environmental safety, and fresher, healthier food offerings for visitors. In 2010, the 1.2 million visitors to Shenandoah spent more than $70 million in the park and nearby communities that supported nearly 1,100 jobs in the local area. Last year, the concessioner alone employed more than 250 people and generated $13.9 million in gross revenues. DNC will be reaching out to the local community and to current concession employees to ensure a smooth transition into the park.
