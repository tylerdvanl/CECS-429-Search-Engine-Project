The National Park Service may permit a special park use providing the activity will not unduly interfere with normal park operations, cause derogation of the park's resources or values, or present a threat to public safety or property. Primary consideration will be given to potential resource damage and to anticipated disruption of normal public use.Click here for more information for more information on Permits and Special Park Use.
