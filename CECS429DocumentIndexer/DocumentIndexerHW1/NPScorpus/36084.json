    "body": "Camping       Designated Campgrounds  There are five designated campgrounds within the park: Governors Landing, Rough Canyon, San Pedro, Spur 406, and 277 North. Sites are available on a first-come, first-served basis. There are no reservations. Campgrounds are generally open year-round and rarely fill up, except on holiday weekends.  Campground fees range from $4 to $8 per site (50% discount with Interagency Senior Pass or Access Pass) and payable within 30 minutes of occupying a campsite. There is a self-pay fee station centrally located at each designated campground. Each site has a covered picnic table and fire grill. All campgrounds have vault toilets. Quiet hours are from 10 pm to 6 am. Check-out time is 11 am.  RV Sites Though most sites will accommodate RVs, there are no hookups. An RV dump station with potable water is located along the road to the Diablo East boat ramp. Numerous RV parks in the Del Rio area offer full services. Visit the Del Rio Chamber of Commerce at 1915 Veterans Blvd, or call them at 830-775-3551. For more information or visit the Chamber of Commerce website.  Camping Limits Site capacity is not to exceed eight persons and one recreational vehicle camping unit (three vehicles total). Vehicles must be parked in designated parking areas only and may not be driven off-road.

Group Campgrounds  The park has three areas available for group camping: Rock Quarry, San Pedro, and 277 North. Group camp size must have a minimum of 15 people. Cost is $2 per person per night.

An individual cannot rent a group campsite for more than 14 consecutive days. An individual can only reserve the same group campsite twice within the same calendar year. This limit will be excepted if the group campsite has not been reserved by others 24 hours prior to the desired date. The demand for some of the group campsites has been great. These limits are designed to allow as many different people as possible to enjoy these sites.  Rock Quarry Group Campground Overnight group camp size is limited to a maximum of 35 people.

A developed area, for the purpose of backcountry camping, is defined as a designated campground, dispersed camping area, day-use picnic area, launch ramp, or public road. In addition, the entire south shoreline from Amistad Dam eastward to the US 277 bridge, with the exception of Hunt Area 5 during non-hunting season, is considered a developed area.  The following areas are closed to backcountry camping:    Hunt areas during hunting season. All areas accessed by wheeled motor vehicles, except for designated Dispersed Camping Areas. All archeological sites. All caves and rockshelters. Within 100 feet of any springs.   Human Waste Disposal Park visitors are encouraged to carry out all solid human waste and toilet paper from backcountry areas of the park with a commercially produced spill-proof and trash container safe waste bag system, or with a dump-station compatible waste system. Doing so will maintain visitor health and safety, preserve the water quality, and reduce other environmental impacts. Please help us protect your park!",
