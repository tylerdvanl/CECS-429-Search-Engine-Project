A team including representatives from the National Park Service, US Air Force Museum, South Dakota Historical Society and the Ellsworth Heritage Foundation studied the sites and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the historic resources. Through this report, it was decided that designation as a National Historic Site would be the best preservation option due to the National Park Service's mission \"to protect and conserve\" historic resources unimpaired for future generations.",
