Mushrooms are a type of fungus with a fleshy fruiting body. Most consist of underground filaments and a gilled cap supported by a stalk. The gills are loaded with spores that are shed to propagate their species. Mushrooms thrive in cool and moist environments and a diversity of species are found throughout the park during the summer and fall.  Fungi are distinct from animals and plants by mode of nutrition. While animals ingest food and plants manufacture their own, mushrooms secrete enzymes to digest surrounding organic matter. They then absorb the released nutrients. By decomposing dead or decaying organisms and recycling nutrients, fungi serve an important ecological function.",
