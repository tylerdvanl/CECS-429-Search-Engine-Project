    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Safety            Safety       Cover up, wear a hat, and use sunscreen to avoid sunburn. Beware of hazardous surf conditions and crosscurrents and do not swim alone. Be cautious in shoreline shallows and near shore reefs; avoid potentially harmful stingrays, fire coral, spiny sea urchins, and stinging organisms. Cuts from coral and other marine life infect quickly; clean and medicate them. Corals are fragile animal skeletons; don’t stand or hang on them. We recommend you scuba dive with a professional group. Check on regulations and best practices before boating. Don’t anchor in coral reef areas. Learn to recognize and avoid hazardous vegetation. Contact with poisonous manchineel trees – including sap, leaves, bark, and fruit resembling small green apples – can cause a chemical burn. Touching your eyes after such contact can cause swelling or even temporary blindness. Contact with the holly-like Christmas bush causes a severe rash.",
