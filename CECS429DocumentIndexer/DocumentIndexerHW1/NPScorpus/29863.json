    "body": "Research          Â    Historic archival material serves as the basis for the restoration and interpretation of Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site. Documentary resources include original estate records, ledgers, account books, diaries, and photographs that illustrate the history of estate management and offer insight into the operation of the farm, the park and formal gardens, as well as the mansion, pavilion, and coachhouse. The significance of this collection lies not just in its relative completeness, but also in its potential to serve historians.  The archives collection and reference library include architectural drawings, photographs, the estate accounting ledgers, maps, oral histories, historian's files and clippings, and the park's resource management documents. Consult the Repository Finding Aid for more information.  Research materials in the park's reference library and archives are available to the public by appointment. Additionally, many research documents published by the park are available online.
