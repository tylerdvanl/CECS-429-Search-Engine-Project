The pueblo has been partially excavated and a few of the room foundations stabilized. The trail also features views of petroglyphs. Newspaper Rock has more than 650 petroglyphs adorning boulders below the overlook. Because of unstable slopes, the area is closed below the cliff. Free spotting scopes are available at the viewpoint.

As the cliff sides eroded, logs tumbled into the valley below. Crystal Forest, Long Logs, Agate House, and Giant Logs are all trails that feature the many wonders of Petrified Forest.
