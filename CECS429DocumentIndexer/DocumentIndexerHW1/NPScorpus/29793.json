    "body": "General Charles Pomeroy Stone         An illustration of Charles P. Stone from Harper’s Weekly in 1886. National Park Service, Statue of Liberty NM  Born on September 30, 1824 in Greenfield, Massachusetts, Charles P. Stone was a career United States Army officer, civil engineer and surveyor. He became the Statue of Liberty's chief engineer from 1883 to 1885 after serving with distinction in the Mexican-American War and U.S. Civil War. With a reputation as an excellent organizer and energetic worker, Stone's job was to oversee shipments, construction work, and the proper attachment of the Statue to the pedestal. When Stone's job was completed in 1886, many people said that the island would have to be overturned to dislodge the monument from its setting. Only a few months after the Statue of Liberty's inauguration, Stone died of pneumonia and was buried in West Point National Cemetery.       Full page illustration from The Daily Graphic shows work progress on Bedloe's Island NATIONAL PARK SERVICE, STATUE OF LIBERTY NM       Back to People",
