In recent times, tilapia have been introduced into the ponds for mosquito control. However, the park is in the process of removing these non-native fishes that are not naturally a part of our Hawaiian ecosystem.The tidal pools within the park hold a colorful array of native tropical fish. Watch them swimming among the coral, pausing to graze on seaweed or resting on the tide pool bottom.",
