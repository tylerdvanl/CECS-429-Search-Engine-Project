Malnutrition, disease, boredom, loneliness, as wel as extreme heat and cold were just a few of the perils soldiers faced. Add in the long marches and constant threat of attack when away from the fort and many would consider a life here in 1859 downright miserable. It was a big job to be in charge of men enduring these hardships, while at the same time enduring them oneself. However, from 1859-1878, the 40 men detailed in this series did just that. From their labor, Fort Larned exerted great influence on the Indian Wars and the American west.  Â          Capt. George Hume Steuart Oct. 22, 1859 to Nov. 26, 1859       Lt.
