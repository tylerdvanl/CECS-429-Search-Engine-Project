Historical Significance: From 1748 to 1751, three Spanish missions (San Francisco Xavier de Horcasitas, San Ildefonso, and Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria) and a presidio (San Francisco Xavier de Gigedo) were built within five miles of this site by missionaries, soldiers, and resident Indians. The Spaniards' goals were to Christianize and civilize the numerous Indian tribes in the area and to establish a presence. During this period, a rock dam and a system of acequias (canals) were constructed just east of Apache Pass to irrigate the fields of one of the nearby missions. All of these improvements were abandoned in 1755 due to a combination of disease, drought, and Indian troubles. Apache Pass, named by the Spanish, was a gravel bar crossing on the San Gabriel River in this general area that was used successively by Americans Indians, explorers, settlers, and local farmers and ranchers. Available Facilities: amphitheater, restaurant (upcoming), other ancillary facilities Exhibits: several outdoor exhibits have been proposed To learn more: www.apachepass.com\/index.html Mission Tejas State Park Location: 120 State Park Road 44, 16 miles east\/northeast of Grapeland and just north of State Highway 21 Telephone: (936) 687-2394 Access: unrestricted.

In 1934, the Civilian Conservation Corps built a commemorative representation of the 1690 mission at the park site. The park was managed by the Texas Forest Service until it became a state park in 1956. The Rice Family log home, which was built by Joseph Rice Sr. between 1828 and 1838, is one of the oldest structures in the area. It initially served as a stopover for immigrants, adventurers, and local residents traveling the Old San Antonio Road.

The site was abandoned during the 13th century. After that time, the Caddo continued to live in the area and shared the culture of previous residents, but later groups lacked the sophisticated ceremonialism and material wealth characterized by earlier times. The Hasinai Caddo groups continued to live through the 1830s in their traditional East Texas homeland. By the early 1840s, all Caddo groups had moved west to the Brazos River area to avoid Anglo settlers who brought repressive measures and colonization efforts. Since the late 1850s, the Caddo have lived primarily in western Oklahoma. Available Facilities: Visitors can walk the 0.7 mile self-guided interpretive trail to see the Caddos' burial, low temple, and ceremonial mounds. An additional trail along El Camino Real is also available as well as guided tours. Exhibits: The museum displays approximately 200 artifacts dating from 750-1400 AD, including pottery, tools, and weapons.
