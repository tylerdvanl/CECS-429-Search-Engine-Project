    "body": "Community Artist Program - How to Apply       The Community Artist in the Parks (CAIP) serves from April 1 through October 31, with additional required training in mid-March. Artists must complete at least 24 hours of visitor contact time per month, of which a minimum of 18 hours are spent in \"front-country\" locations. Artists must also visit each of the four park units at least once during their tenure, and conduct at least one community outreach event (e.g. a lecture or workshop).  Community Artists may sell their work in Canyonlands Natural History Association (CNHA) outlets. (Specific sales arrangements will be made between the Community Artist in the Parks and CNHA.) Artists are responsible for transportation and materials costs, though some mileage may be reimbursed if funds are available. While serving, Community Artists also receive excellent exposure and a yearly entrance pass to the Southeast Utah Group (SEUG) of NPS units: Arches, Canyonlands, Hovenweep and Natural Bridges.  The CAIP visits locations throughout the SEUG -- including visitor centers -- and creates art on-site.Your medium must be such that you can transport materials to foot-accessed locations in a reasonable manner. For example, Chad Niehaus (2009) created linoleum block prints during his tenure and was able to pack his entire materials kit into a small backpack. Pete Apicella (2010) worked with bold colored markers, colored pencils and found paper. Kathy Cooney (2011) created watercolors plein air and at the Arches Visitor Center. Serena Supplee (2014) painted in a studio from field sketches, but also completed large oils on site over the course of several days. It is important for the CAIP to be comfortable explaining his\/her medium, process, and inspiration. This isn't easy for every artist. You will be asked fairly frequently why you do the things you do, how you do them, etc. Are you interested in actively discussing your artistic process while you create? If you are, you will enjoy the CAIP program tremendously. Looking for More? Read about \"A Day in the Life\" of a community artist, or check out some frequently asked questions.
