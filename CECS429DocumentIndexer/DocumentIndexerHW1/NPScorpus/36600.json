    "body": "Getting Around in the Park       Most visits to Arches involve traveling by vehicle along the scenic drive, which provides access to many viewpoints and trailheads. Parking is limited at all destinations. Popular trailheads like Delicate Arch and Devils Garden often fill for hours at a time, especially on weekends and holidays. Many parking spots can't fit recreational vehicles (RVs) or vehicles with trailers. If you're towing a car, considering driving it instead and leaving the big rig outside the park. For more suggestions on traveling in the park and how to avoid the crowds, visit the Traffic & Travel Tips page. ALTERNATIVE TRAVEL OPTIONS Touring by Bike A bike path connects the gateway community of Moab with the entrance to Arches, continuing up Highway 191 to Highway 313 (which leads to Canyonlands National Park and Dead Horse Point State Park). There is no dedicated bike lane along the scenic drive in Arches, and high traffic volume (including many large recreation vehicles) makes for a challenging ride. The road shoulder is very narrow and often disappears without warning. If you plan to ride your bike in Arches:  Consider coming early in the morning when there is less traffic. Exercise caution; most drivers are looking for photo opportunities, not for bicyles. Some of the narrowest road sections are along the switchbacks above the visitor center. Riders can skip this section by shuttling their bikes to an overlook turnout, where there is usually adequate parking. Try to avoid riding on busy weekends and holidays during peak season (March through October).  Commercial Tours Let someone else do the driving and share their knowledge of the park! Several local companies provide guided van tours and hikes in Arches. View the Commercial Tours page for more information. Shuttles & Taxis  Looking for a ride so you don't have to worry about parking? Local taxi services and shuttles provide drop-off, pick-up service in Arches.
