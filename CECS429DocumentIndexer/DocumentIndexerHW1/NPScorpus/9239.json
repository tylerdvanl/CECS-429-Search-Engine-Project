    "body": "Charles Street National Scenic Byway          The Charles Street National Scenic Byway, which runs through the heart of the city and north into Baltimore County, is one of only four national scenic byways located in an urban setting. The roughly 12-mile length of Charles Street consists of a nearly unbroken series of local and National Register historic districts, highlighted by the Mount Vernon Place National Historic Landmark District. In Baltimore County to the north, the natural beauty of Charles Street is evident with a wooded parkway. Just off the byway, the Fire Museum of Maryland showcases the history of firefighting with special exhibits and a collection of more than 50 rigs. Also nearby is the Hampton National Historic Site, which explores Maryland agricultural society through the lens of an early 19th-century estate.",
