They live in groups of 4 - 20 individuals led by an aged, experienced female.  Javelina have scent glands on their lower backs. Within a herd, javelina often rub against one another, giving each herd a distinctive smell (at least to other javelina). Though similar in appearance, they are not pigs and differ from pigs in both behavior and physiology.  Total length: 35-40 in. (87- 102 cm) Weight: 40- 65 pounds(18-30 kg) Diet: Roots, tubers, seeds, mesquite beans, cactus fruit, agave, prickly pear pads, occasional carrion",
