NPS Photo   Â    The bunkhouse is an example of just one of the many ways visitors still interact with the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve. For many people the bunkhouse is a gateway to explore the natural features of the preserve. Without the bunkhouse as a starting point, the wild lands of the preserve might seem overwhelming.  Local residents disagree on how the bunkhouse was originally placed at its current location near  Serpentine Hot Springs. Numerous stories about the bunkhouse have circulated. The stories range from local residents purchasing the bunkhouse to a senator buying the bunkhouse. To add to the  confusion, the Alaska Road Commission has records of completing a building project at Serpentine Hot Springs in 1948. Although the history of the bunkhouse is unclear, one thing is certain, the bunkhouse has become an important part of the way local residents and visitors interact with the preserve.  The bunkhouse is a modular \"knockdown\" army structure typical of World War II design. During WWII the army created \"knock-down\" kits and shipped them to various locations. These kits contained all of the materials needed to quickly build a building. The army shipped \"knock-down\" kits to Nome during WWII.  By December 6th, 1942, there were 776 of these \"knock-down\" buildings and quonset huts within the city. After WWII, the surplus buildings were sold. The Alaska Road Commission was responsible for buying many \"knock-down\" buildings and quonset huts. It is possible that the Alaska Road Commission had the sections of the bunkhouse moved to site and reassembled in 1942. The bunkhouse has been updated several times since the late 1940s. The National Park Service (NPS) took responsibility for Serpentine Hot Springs in 1980 after the establishment of the preserve. The NPS makes improvements to the building, while being mindful of the wishes of local residents. Visitors also sometimes  make improvements, but are reminded to be conscious of the traditional atmosphere of the site. An early  NPS brochure for visitors of the preserve offered the following advice: \"Serpentine Hot Springs has always had a casual, relaxed, and shared atmosphere. All who found their way to the springs shared the responsibility of caring for the facilities. Each person left the area in such a condition which contributed to the next person's enjoyment. The National Park Service encourages newcomers to respect this tradition.\" The tradition of people visiting and exploring the natural and man-made features of the preserve continues to this day.",
