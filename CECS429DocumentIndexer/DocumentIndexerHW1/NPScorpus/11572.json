    "body": "Reading Room: Freedom of Information Act Responses       The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) gives you the right to access any Point Reyes National Seashore, National Park Service (NPS), or Department of the Interior (DOI) records unless the information in those records is protected by one or more of nine exemptions (reasons an agency may withhold records from a requester) and there is a sound legal basis to withhold them. Many of the FOIA response documents include redactions related to one or more of the nine exemptions under FOIA. In these cases, the FOIA exemption is noted and is explained in the associated transmittal letter. Additional information, including certain personal information, (e.g. personal addresses, phone numbers, and or personal electronic email addresses) has been redacted to maintain the privacy rights of these individuals. On this page you will find materials provided to members of the public and media who have requested them under the FOIA, as well as the final letter from the NPS to the requester. Because of the large number of documents requested of Point Reyes National Seashore through FOIA since 2007, not all of the documents are currently available. This webpage will be updated frequently with materials responsive to past FOIA requests, as well as future ones. 2012 FOIA Log (7 KB PDF) - Brief descriptions of the FOIA requests Fiscal Year 2012 FOIA Responses 2011 FOIA Log (7 KB PDF) - Brief descriptions of the FOIA requests Fiscal Year 2011 FOIA Responses 2010 FOIA Log (18 KB PDF) - Brief descriptions of the FOIA requests Fiscal Year 2010 FOIA Responses Fiscal Year 2009 FOIA Responses (coming soon) Fiscal Year 2008 FOIA Responses (coming soon) Fiscal Year 2007 FOIA Responses (coming soon)  Adobe® Acrobat Reader® is needed to view PDF documents.
