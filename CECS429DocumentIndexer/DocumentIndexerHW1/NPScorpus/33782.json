    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility             Accessibility       The grounds and public areas of Fort Monroe may present accessibility challenges. Many of the facilities are historic and built before passage of The Americans with Disabilities Act. Improvements and efforts to increase accessibility are actively ongoing. Frequent visitors to Fort Monroe will continue to see improvements in accessibility over time.   The primary visitor service areas, including the Casemate Museum, are wheelchair accessible. Appropriate accessible parking and facilities are available.  The walls of Fort Monroe offer limited accessibility. The ramps to access the top of the walls are steep and handrails are provided. After reaching the top the ground is uneven and has many obstacles and historic features from the use of Fort Monroe as a military fortification for almost 200 years. Visitors using wheelchairs, or who have visual impairments may need assistance.  Qualified Service Animals are allowed in all national parks. For information regarding a definition of a service animal may be found on the website for the US Department of Justice. A qualified service animal may accompany you anywhere you are able to go.",
