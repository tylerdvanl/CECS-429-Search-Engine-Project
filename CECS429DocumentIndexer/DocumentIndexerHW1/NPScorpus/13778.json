Here are just a few ways you can live up to his legacy during your visit.      Ranger-led Programs Ranger-led programs are a great way to get the inside story on Theodore Roosevelt Island, whether you are a local who visits every day or a tourist in town for a few hours. Check the calendar to find out when and where to meet for programs.      Wildlife Viewing Birders will find habitat for wading birds, raptors, and warblers. Wildflowers put on a spectacular show in spring and early summer.      Walking or Running A variety of trails lend themselves to different activities. The Swamp Trail is mostly flat with a boardwalk section. The Woods and Upland Trails are surfaced with pea-sized gravel.      Canoeing or Kayaking An easy flat water paddle around the island is the best way to see how it is shaped by the Potomac River. If you bring your own craft, you can put it in the water near the footbridge that leads to the island or near the culvert between the two parking lots. If you rent your craft in Georgetown, be prepared to paddle across the wide, busy river.",
