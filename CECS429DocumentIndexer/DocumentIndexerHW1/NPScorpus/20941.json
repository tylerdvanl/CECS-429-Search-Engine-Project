The donor receives a letter of acknowledgement from the park superintendent and other recognition, as appropriate. Unless the donor specifies how they would like the funds to be spent, general donation account funds are used at the national monument's discretion for interpretive, educational or research projects. Large donations may be earmarked for specific projects determined mutually by the donor and the national monument.
