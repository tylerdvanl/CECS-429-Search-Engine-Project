    "body": "Leave No Trace       Plan Ahead and Prepare  Know the regulations and special concerns of Yosemite. Prepare for extreme weather, hazards, and emergencies. Schedule your trip to avoid times of high use. Visit in small groups. Split larger parties into smaller groups. Repackage food to minimize waste. Use a map and compass to eliminate the use of rock cairns or flagging.   Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces  Durable surfaces include established trails and campsites, rock, gravel, dry grasses or snow. Obey camping restrictions near lakes, streams, trails, other campsites, and historic and cultural sites and structures. Good campsites are found, not made. Altering a site is not necessary. In popular areas:   Concentrate use on existing trails and campsites. Walk single-file in the middle of the trail, even when wet or muddy. Keep campsites small. Focus activity in areas where vegetation is absent.   In pristine areas:   Disperse use to prevent the creation of campsites and trails. Avoid places where impacts are just beginning.     Dispose of Waste Properly  Pack it in, pack it out. Inspect your campsite and rest areas for trash or spilled foods. Pack out all trash, leftover food, and litter. Deposit solid human waste in catholes dug six inches deep at least 100 feet from water, camp, and trails. Cover and disguise the cathole when finished. Pack out toilet paper and hygiene products. To wash yourself or your dishes, carry water 100 feet away from streams or lakes and use small amounts of biodegradable soap. Scatter strained dishwater.   Leave What You Find  Preserve the past: examine, but do not touch, cultural or historic structures and artifacts. Leave rocks, plants and other natural objects as you find them. Avoid introducing or transporting non-native species. Do not build structures, furniture, or dig trenches.   Minimize Campfire Impacts  Campfires can cause lasting impacts to the backcountry. Instead, consider using a lightweight stove for cooking and a candle lantern for light. Use established fire rings or fire pans. Keep fires small. Only use sticks from the ground that can be broken by hand. Burn all wood and coals to ash and put out campfires completely.   Respect Wildlife  Observe wildlife from a distance. Do not follow or approach them. Never feed animals. Feeding wildlife damages their health, alters natural behaviors, and exposes them to predators and other dangers. Protect wildlife and your food by storing rations and trash in bear canisters. Leave pets at home. Avoid wildlife during sensitive times: mating, nesting, raising young, or winter.   Be Considerate of Other Visitors  Respect other visitors and protect the quality of their experience. Be courteous. Yield to other users on the trail. Step to the downhill side of the trail when encountering pack stock. Take breaks and camp away from trails and other visitors. Let nature's sounds prevail. Avoid loud voices and noises.
