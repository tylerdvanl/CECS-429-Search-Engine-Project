    "body": "Weather       The weather along the Cumberland Plateau can be best described as unpredictable. Each season brings its own weather patterns. Summers are generally hot and humid, with high temperatures sometimes eclipsing 90 degrees. The low temperatures in winter often dip below freezing. Spring sees the most amount of precipitation, but rainfall can occur in various amounts throughout the year. Because Big South Fork spans two states, take note of the weather in the area that you will be visiting:  Jamestown, Tenn. Oneida, Tenn. Stearns, Ky.",
