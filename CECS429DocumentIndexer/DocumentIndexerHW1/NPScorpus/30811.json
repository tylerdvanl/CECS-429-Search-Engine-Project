    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Safety            Safety       Please watch your step. While touring the park grounds it is recommended that visitors wear closed toe comfortable walking shoes. Much of the ground in and outside the fort is uneven.   Please stay in designated touring areas. You will encounter ropes and gates within the fort walls, they are there for your safety. If you would like to see something beyond a roped or gated area, please ask a staff member, and we would be happy to open the way!   Please stay off of the fort walls and gunports. The walls of the fort are sloped outwards. Ropes are there for your safety.  Watch your head, hands, and step. The fort door ways are built lower to the ground as part of design and for 18th century heating purposes. This and all the dust and dirt can cause quite a few people to trip. Please take care to look out above and below. The fort lumber does splinter, please be careful while gripping railings.  Please do not play in the water barrels. In the 18th century they existed as fire extinguishers. Today we chlorinate them to stop the spread of mosquitoes. There is fresh water provided in the Gregg Building inside the fort as well as the restrooms.  Have Fun!",
