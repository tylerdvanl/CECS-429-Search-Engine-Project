The signal is instantly repeated to a receiver at the Channel Islands National Park Robert J. Lagomarsino Visitor Center in Ventura, where audiences experience the program in real time. For the 250,000 people who visit the Ventura visitor center annually, these virtual hikes, talks, and dives offer unique opportunities to connect to the rugged beauty and remarkable resources of the islands. Programs are also transmitted to participating schools and broadcast live into students can ask questions as they explore the Channel Islands. Using wireless technology, the Live Dive, offer views into a hidden world. Without ever getting wet, students and visitors can take an “underwater hike” through the Channel Islands kelp forest guided by a park ranger. Fitted with a special SCUBA face mask, an underwater ranger communicates with the live audience and answers questions about the marine ecosystem. The Live Hike offers students and visitors the opportunity to take an interactive virtual hike on Anacapa Island with park rangers, researchers and scientists to learn about ongoing restoration projects, along with the natural and cultural history of the island without ever crossing the channel. The Channel Islands Live EagleCAM transmits similarly from Santa Cruz Island to the Red Mountain tower. Other webcams coming soon will bring views of various island features including the landing cove, and underwater in the kelp forest.",
