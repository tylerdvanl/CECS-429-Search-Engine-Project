During the summer, park rangers offer guided walks and junior ranger programs. You can also visit our partners know as Keweenaw Heritage Sites. You may be able to talk with a solider at Fort Wilkins during the 1840s, go for a hike in the Porcupine Mountains, explore a farm site at Hanka Homestead, visit a lighthouse at Eagle Harbor or ride a train at the Hough County Historical Museum in Lake Linden. Occasionally, the park, our partners or surrounding communities host special events often with activities geared for kids. They may be ski or bike races, heritage celebrations, musical or theatrical performances, competitions or art shows. Check the Schedule of Events page for more information.",
