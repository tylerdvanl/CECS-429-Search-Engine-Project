    "body": "Boreal Chorus Frog        A chorus frog sings in Gibbon Meadows NPS\/Neal Herbert       Scientific Name Pseudacris maculata Identification  Adults reach 1 to 1.5 inches in length, and females are usually larger than males; newly metamorphosed juveniles are less than 1 inch long. Brown, olive, tan, or green (sometimes bicolored) with a prominent black stripe on each side from the nostril through the eye and down the sides to the groin; three dark stripes down the back, often incomplete or broken into blotches.  Habitat  Common, but seldom seen due to its small size and secretive habits. Lives in moist meadows and forests near wetlands. Lays eggs in loose, irregular clusters attached to submerged vegetation in quiet water.  Behavior  Breeds in shallow temporary pools or ponds during the late spring. Calls are very conspicuous, resembling the sound of a thumb running along the teeth of a comb. Males call and respond, producing a loud and continuous chorus at good breeding sites, from April to early July, depending on elevation and weather. Usually call in late afternoon and evening. Tadpoles eat aquatic plants; adults mostly eat insects. Eaten by fish, predacious aquatic insect larvae, other amphibians, garter snakes, mammals, and birds.             Minute Out In It: Chorus Frogs Watch and listen to a group of male boreal chorus frogs calling in the Gibbon Meadows, while Ranger Rita Garcia reminisces about discovering them for the first time.       More Information  Listen to the sounds of boreal chorus frogs in our Sound Library",
