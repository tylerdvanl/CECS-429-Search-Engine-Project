Approved backcountry roads are designated routes and are marked with a yellow arrow sign with a number on it.     If you plan to ride at the park, please be aware of the rules in Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulation, as the following are prohibited: (1) Possessing a bicycle in a wilderness area established by Federal statute.         (2) Operating a bicycle during periods of low visibility, or while traveling through a tunnel, or between sunset and sunrise, without exhibiting on the operator or bicycle a white light or reflector that is visible from a distance of at least 500 feet to the front and with a red light or reflector visible from at least 200 feet to the rear. (3) Operating a bicycle abreast of another bicycle except where authorized by the superintendent. (4) Operating a bicycle while consuming an alcoholic beverage or carrying in hand an open container of an alcoholic beverage. Also, please use extreme caution when bicycling on park roads as some areas have low visibility, no shoulder and are steep with windy turns. Please stay on the roads so our fragile desert soils stay protected. It is always a good idea to carry plenty of water, cycle with a friend, and let someone know your itinerary.                Important Note    Bicycles are subject to the Entrance Fee Requirements at Lake Mead NRA. A daily pass (valid for 1-7 days) for individuals can be purchased for $5 from entrance stations located throughout the park, or at the Park Headquarters lobby front desk in Boulder City, Nevada. Annual Passes can also be used for bicycles. Please keep your pass with you as you ride through the park. For more information on Entrance Fees in the park, please visit our fees and reservations page.                  Additional Related Pages       Maps",
