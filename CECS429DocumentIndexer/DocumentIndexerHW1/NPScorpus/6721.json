With such colorful species as woodland sunflowers (Helianthus strumosus),  bird-foot violets (Viola pedata), and Virginia bluebells (Mertensia virginica), visitors cannot help but be overwhelmed by the natural beauty surrounding them in the forest. Along the banks of the Potomac and ShenandoahRivers, a different group of wildflowers can be enjoyed, including monkeyflower (Mimulus ringens), wide-leaved joe-pye weed (Eupatorium purpureum), and the New England aster (Aster novae-angliae). Whether a botanist, nature-lover, or historian, no one can deny the beauty of Harpers Ferry's wildflowers.",
