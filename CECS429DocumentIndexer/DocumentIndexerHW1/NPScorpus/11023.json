However, the Grand Portage collection does include a number of archeological objects such as buttons and shoe buckles that offer glimpses of the actual clothing worn by fur traders and voyageurs. This gallery also shows part of a colorful Assomption sash of the type popularized by voyageurs, although the sash is probably of later 19th century manufacture.
