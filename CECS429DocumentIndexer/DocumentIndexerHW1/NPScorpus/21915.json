Along the Ałts'e'tnaey-Nal'cine Trail: Historical Narratives, Historical Places tells the story of connections that Upper Ahtna people have to the northern part of Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, focusing on the early years of the 20th century. It is based on a series of oral history interviews conducted with Ahtna elders from the communities of Chistochina and Mentasta in 2012 along with previously conducted interviews, monographs from early United States Geological Survey expeditions to the area, and other anthropological and historical literature. At the center of this story are two women: Sarah (whose Ahtna name was Nelggodi), the wife of Charley Sanford, and her eldest daughter Daisy (whose Ahtna name was Kendesnii). Under difficult circumstances these women raised large families, and their closest surviving relatives are the primary source of information for this report. Along the Ałts'e'tnaey-Nal'cine Trail is the result of collaboration between Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, the Cheesh'na Tribal Council, and Mount Sanford Tribal Consortium.",
