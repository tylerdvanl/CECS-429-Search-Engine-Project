These are just some of the activities children can experience when participating in one of Saguaro National Park's Junior Ranger programs. Here at Saguaro National Park we feel the future stewardship of our park is of the utmost importance. A Junior Ranger is an explorer. A Junior Ranger is a learner, and this type of learning is informal and fun. A Junior Ranger is a protector of the national parks. Junior Rangers discover things they can do to help make sure there are always parks to visit in the future. They learn things they can do in the parks, and things they can do when they return home. When they have completed their activity booklets, children are sworn in as a Junior Ranger and receive a badge and certificate. Each year 450,000 children become Junior Rangers. In today's high paced world, we recognize that schedules are even busier than ever! That's why we have a few different ways kids can become Junior Rangers. First, they can come into the Visitor Center to pick up their workbook for the Self-guided Discovery Day Pack. This pack takes approximately 1-3 hours to complete and is totally self-guided and can be completed at the child's own pace. Junior Rangers and their families explore the parks using activity booklets designed especially for them. The booklets introduce park stories and point out things of interest that might otherwise go unnoticed.  Summer Programs Another way kids can become Junior Rangers at Saguaro National Park is by participating in one of our fabulous Summer Junior Ranger Camps. These programs are held at Saguaro National Park's east district, and vary in details. In this camp children will experience the desert by learning about the animals native to our desert home, the importance of water, how to hike safely in the desert, interactive games and activities and much, much more.  Not So Junior Ranger Program The rest of the family, young adults and seniors can also particitpate in our NEW Not So Junior Ranger Program. Rack up as much points as you can by visiting our visitor centers, hiking trails, observing wildlife, and completing some saguaro trivia questions.  Finally, for those of you long distance or just unable to make it to the park in person, kids can now become On-line Junior Rangers. To learn more about this opportunity go to Go WebRangers.",
