Pets are not allowed on any hiking trails. Pets may accompany visitors in the campground, and at overlooks and pullouts along the paved scenic drives. Pets may be walked on roads or in parking lots, but must be leashed at all times when outside a vehicle.Important!The desert can be deadly for pets. Car temperatures rise quickly in the sun, even on cool days. Your pet can easily die of heat exhaustion.

We recommend you not leave pets in the car at all when temperatures are above 68 degrees, even with the windows cracked.There are no boarding facilities in Blanding or Monticello.
