Climate change is altering ecoystem norms. Invasive species carried in on firewood and the bottoms of our shoes and cars can wreak havoc on species (see the gypsy moth defoliation at left).  Boundary encroachment and area development stress the pristine ecosystems within with pollution runoff and litter. The more we learn about these problems, the more we can work together with the surrounding community to seek solutions.           Natural Features and Ecosystems Looking at plants and animals individually is like looking at the earth with tunnel vision. Take a step back and look at the natural features and ecosystems of Prince William Forest Park are all interdependent on each other. Learn how geologic features were formed and how geology leads to soil types and how soil types lead to plant development and how plants lead to animal habitats.
