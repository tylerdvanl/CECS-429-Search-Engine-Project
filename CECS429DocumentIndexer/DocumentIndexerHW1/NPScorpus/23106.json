The purpose of a general management plan (GMP) is to map out a clear vision for the direction of management of Colorado National Monument for the next 15â€“20 years. The GMP will provide comprehensive and integrated guidance for perpetuating natural systems, preserving cultural resources, providing opportunities for visitor enjoyment and understanding and the organizational mechanism, including partners, to accomplish the plan. The main issues addressed by this plan revolve around the rapid urbanization occurring around the monument, and how to manage the monument in the face of this change. Issues include managing ecosystems and cultural resources, vandalism and resource damages, the future of trails and trailheads, use conflicts on Rim Rock Drive, interagency information, education and outreach, and boundary adjustments.
