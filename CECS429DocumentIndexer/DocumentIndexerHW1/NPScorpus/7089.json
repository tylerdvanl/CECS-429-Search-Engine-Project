    "body": "Bicycling Information       All roads in Theodore Roosevelt National Park are open to cyclists. The park roads follow the contours of the badlands allowing riders to enjoy the park close up. Off-road cycling is not allowed in the park. All bicycles must remain on paved or dirt roads. Bicyclists should exercise caution as they ride in the park; they will share the narrow roads with large RVs and other vehicles. Traffic is heaviest in June, July, August, and September and road shoulders are absent in some places. Bicyclists must obey all traffic laws. Use caution around bison and other wildlife. The Road Log Guide to Theodore Roosevelt National Park can add to your appreciation of the park. It is available at park visitor centers for a fee (or at the TRNHA Bookstore). Special note on the Maah Daah Hey Trail: Bicycles are not permitted on the trail as it passes through both the North and South Units of the park. Bicycles cannot be carried or walked over the trail. They must go around the park. The Buffalo Gap Trail is an alternative route to the west of the South Unit. Users of the trail near the North Unit must use existing roads.",
