    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Pets              Pets       Activities with pets are limited at Colorado National Monument. Pets are not allowed on hiking trails or anywhere in the backcountry. Pets may also not accompany cyclists while riding on Rim Rock Drive. Pets may accompany visitors in the developed campground area and may be walked in the park along paved roads. Pets must be leashed at all times when outside a vehicle. Important! Canyon Country can be deadly for pets. Car temperatures rise quickly in the sun, even on cool days, your pet can easily die of heat exhaustion. If you are leaving a pet in the car, crack the windows as much as possible and leave water to drink. We recommend you not leave pets in the car at all when temperatures are above 68 degrees, even with the windows cracked.",
