    "body": "Yapashi Pueblo       All of Bandelier's backcountry has been affected in some way by the 2011 Las Conchas Fire and the massive flooding that followed it. This hike was strenuous before the fire\/floods and is more difficult now. It is still an excellent destination for a hike but hikers should be prepared for less shade than before, missing trails, and missing signs. Yapashi Pueblo is located 6 miles from the visitor center at Bandelier. The hike to Yapashi is strenuous, passing through Mid-Alamo Canyon (>500' elevation change in less than 1\/4 mile). Except in a spring after a snowy winter, water is rarely available along this route. For most people this hike will take all or nearly all day.       Carins such as this one mark important areas along trails.  This one marks the trail leading up and out of mid-Alamo Canyon. photo by kevin stillman",
