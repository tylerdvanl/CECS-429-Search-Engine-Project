There is no guarantee of your safety. Regulations are strictly enforced to protect you and the park's resources. Wildlife All wildlife and wildlife encounters come with inherent risks to visitors. Do not approach, startle, or feed animals. Feeding, harassing, or molesting wildlife is strictly prohibited in the park and subject to fines. Maintain a distance of at least 50 yards. Wild animals –even those that seem 'tame' –can pose a potential hazard to people, whether through the spread of disease or through direct physical contact. Weather Like everything else about Olympic, the weather is extremely variable, from season to season and place to place. Visitors should come prepared for a wide range of conditions. Rain gear and layered clothing are essential. Tides Don't get trapped by a rising tide! Several points along the coast are only passable at lower tides. Always carry –and know how to use - a tide chart when hiking along the coast. Tide charts are available at visitor centers and coastal ranger stations.
