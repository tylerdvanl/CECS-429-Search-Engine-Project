Would you like to help preserve the wonderfully rich natural and cultural resources protected here? There are many ways to become more involved ... You can help Capulin Volcano National Monument by volunteering, making a donation, or purchasing items through the park's cooperating association, Western National Parks Association. Consider becoming a VIP - a participant in the Volunteers In Parks program. Volunteers are involved in virtually every aspect of park operations. Some work full-time during the summer season, while others may work one day a week or even for a few hours on a special project. You can help Capulin Volcano by making a donation to the park. Donations support projects and programs that contribute directly to the visitor experience like trail rehabilitation and program outreach.  Â       You can help Capulin Volcano and learn more about the park by purchasing books and other items online from the Western National Park Association Bookstore or by purchasing items from their bookstore within the park. Proceeds from sales benefit the educational, scientific, historical, and research efforts of the National Park Service. Your purchases from the Capulin Volcano store directly benefit Capulin Volcano National Monument. Public support is a critical component in the management of National Park Service lands. No other federal agency relies as heavily on the generosity and kindness of its visitors. We thank you for your past support and look forward to future partnerships.",
