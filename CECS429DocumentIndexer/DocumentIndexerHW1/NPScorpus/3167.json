The National Parks Conservation Association's Mission To protect and enhance America’s National Park System for present and future generations. The National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) is an independent, nonpartisan voice working to address major threats facing the National Park System. NPCA was established in 1919, just three years after the National Park Service. Stephen Mather, the first director of the Park Service, was one of our founders. He felt very strongly that the national parks would need an independent voice—outside the political system—to ensure these places remained unimpaired for future generations. Now, nearly one hundred years later, NPCA has a million members and supporters. In addition to our LEED-certified national headquarters in Washington, D.C., NPCA has 24 regional and field offices around the country. The National Parks Conservation Association's Core Values At NPCA our work to protect and enhance our national parks is guided by six core values: Commitment to Mission, Empowerment, Teamwork, Accountability, Innovation, and Diversity. Our core values embolden NPCA to achieve excellence; unite us with one another, our members, volunteers and partners; and fuel our commitment to become the catalyst and leader of a national parks movement that fulfills our shared mission to protect and enhance America’s national parks for present and future generations.
