There are many opportunities to enjoy Mojave National Preserve with your pet. Pets are prohibited inside buildings.   Pets must be kept on a leash no longer than six feet at all times, with the exception of dogs used while hunting. Pets may never be left unattended. Pet excrement must be collected and disposed of in garbage receptacles Pet Health and Safety The desert can be deadly for pets. Car temperatures rise quickly in the sun, even on cool days. Your pet could die of heat exhaustion. If you must leave a pet in a car, crack the windows as much as possible and leave water to drink. We recommend not leaving pets in the car at all when temperatures are above about 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees C), even with the windows cracked. Abundant cactus spines and the chance of a run-in with a rattlesnake or scorpion are good reasons not to let your pet roam free. Wild predators such as coyotes and mountain lions could prey on your pet, even during daylight hours.      What's the big deal?   Even though your pet may obey commands and be well behaved, other visitors do not know your pet. They may feel uncomfortable in the presence of an unleashed animal.  Your pet is excited by the sights, sounds, and smells in a new place. The wide open space that drew you to Mojave is attractive to your pet as well. Even dogs that often stay close may want to run and explore in new surroundings.  Read this short article (PDF, 176KB) from seasonal Park Ranger Bob Mills about his experiences with pets in Mojave.  By following the park's simple regulations and respecting fellow visitors, you and your pet can have a happy and healthy park outing.",
