If you have any uncertainty about a planned activity, it is best to contact the Special Use Permit Office beforehand, to inquire about the need for a permit. Some uses also require an application fee, reservations, and other fees.

Commercial Filming\/Photography Commercial Film Permits must be obtained when filming is done by other than bona fide newsreel or news television. Commercial photography permits are required if photography is to be done of vehicles or other articles of commerce or models for the purpose of commercial advertising or for resale. It is the policy of the National Park Service to allow filming and photography when it is consistent with the protection and public enjoyment of park resources and when it avoids conflict with the public's normal use and enjoyment of the park. A permit is required when the filming, videotaping, sound recording, or still photography involve the use of talent, professional crews, set dressings or props; when they involve product or service advertisement; or when the activity could result in damage to park resources or disruption of visitor use. A permit is also required if the photographer wants to film in areas not open to the public, or before or after normal visitation hours. Generally, permits are not issued for filming on weekends or holidays. Normal visitor use patterns should not be interrupted for longer than five minutes, and only as specified in the approved permit. Visitors will be allowed to watch filming in public areas. Media Breaking News Breaking news is an event that cannot be covered at any other time or at any other location. Filming of breaking news does not involve advertising, sets, props, or models. Coverage of breaking news does not require a permit, but film crews may not disrupt park visitors, damage park resources, or compromise public health and safety regulations. Other Media Frequently there are opportunities for news organizations to focus on park programs, or increase public awareness of park-specific issues. Filming related to these stories must be coordinated and planned in advance. A permit will be issued if it is determined that the park would benefit from the increased public awareness. Still Photography Photography of scenery or historic structures has traditionally been part of a visit to a national park. Photography does not require a permit if it involves only hand-carried equipment (tripod, interchangeable lenses or flash), and does not involve professional crews, product or service advertisement, or use of models, props, or sets. A still photography permit is required when: Product or service advertisement is involved Talent\/models, props, crews, or sets are involved The project has the potential to disrupt other park activities or visitors More than just hand-carried equipment is used Project requires access to an area normally closed or restricted to general public use Access into an area outside of normal public use hours is required Project carries with it a potential risk to park resources Activity raises safety concerns that can be mitigated through issuance of a permit with restrictions or conditions Filming\/Photography Permit Application Procedures Use the Application for Commercial Filming\/Still Photography Permit 10-931 or Application for Commercial Filming\/Still Photography Permit 10-932 to request permits for the following activities. Completed applications must be returned to the park with the $50 application fee. Your request will be evaluated on the basis of the information in your application. If substantial staff resources are expended in the evaluation of the request, the applicant will be billed for the additional costs. Therefore, you are encouraged to attach maps, diagrams, script pages, storyboards, vehicle and equipment lists, crew lists, call sheet, itineraries, shot lists, etc. with your application to assist park staff in evaluating your request.

Park managers will not sign location releases supplied by applicants. Insurance Requirement Proof of insurance is required and documentation must carry a commercial liability (minimum of $1 million) issued by a U.S. company.

The Certificate Holder is to be listed as the National Park Service, Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine, 2400 East Fort Ave, Baltimore, MD 21230. High-risk activities or activities which may have the potential for resource impact require higher liability amounts. Small, low-risk projects or still photography may be eligible for a reduction to $500,000. Contact our office for details. A request for a permit will be denied if there is no proof of adequate insurance as stated above. Personal or homeowners liability is not accepted. Certificate should be generated by the insurance company. Bond A refundable damage bond, drawn as a separate payment, may be required for those projects that have a high potential for resource damage or potential for site restoration. The bond amount is determined by estimating the cost of monitoring and site restoration, should you fail to adequately care for complete cleanup of the site. This amount will be specified in the permit. The permittee is responsible for removal of equipment, props, trash, and restoration of the site to original condition, or in a condition satisfactory to the National Park Service. If this is not done, all or part of the damage bond will be retained to offset cleanup\/recovery expenses. If it is not needed, the bond is released when the on-site NPS representative affirms that site restoration is complete and all site use charges have been paid. If a surplus remains after the costs have been reimbursed, the surplus is returned to the permittee. If the bond does not cover all the cost, you will be billed for the difference. Audio and lighting restrictions apply to prevent disruption of visitor activities and\/or disturb visitors. Large reflectors, silks, camera track, jibs, cranes, generators, large props, crowd scenes, foggers, oversized vehicles are discouraged and are authorized on a case-by-case basis, dependent on the location, time of year, time of day, and other mitigating factors. Cancellations The film permittee is responsible for all National Park Service costs up to the time of cancellation. If the cancellation is weather related, we will attempt to make accommodations. Administrative charges are mandatory and non-refundable. Cost of overtime and site cleanup are additional and will be billed as they occur. Revocation As noted in permit conditions, non-compliance with any of the permit conditions could result in revocation of the permit. In addition, the permit contains other conditions or factors relating to revocation: Visitation levels Non-permitted stunts, use of vehicles, special effects or equipment use Unauthorized access of park facilities, structures, and resources False information (deliberately making false and\/or misleading statements in order to obtain a permit Monitoring For filming activities which are perceived to interfere with visitor use, further congest highly visited areas, or have the potential to impact park resources without proper supervision and care, at least one employee of the National Park Service will be assigned to the film crew. Degree of monitoring is based on crew size, equipment, props, scope of project, location, time of day, and time of year. Supervision may be on-site and continual, a representative may spot check the filming to assure compliance, or the Superintendent may bring in other employees to assist in those instances when the scope of the project exceeds the park's ability to properly manage the activity. Costs The National Park Service is required to recover all costs associated with permits for filming and photography. All administrative costs involving permit application and processing are nonrefundable and will be charged to permittee. The park may require that charges be paid before work can begin on NPS property. Any additional costs will be posted as they occur. Permit Application Fee - $50 payable by check, money order, or credit card Hourly Monitoring Fee - $50 per monitor for one-hour minimum Location Fee - Congress has authorized the National Park Service to charge location fees for the use of park lands and facilities for filming and photography purposes.

By law, the National Park Service may not waive recovery of costs for projects that are produced to promote an industry, influence Congressional initiatives, or influence the outcomes of elections. Student Projects Film or video projects that are being produced as a requirement for an accredited course can be issued a student filming or video permit. The student must provide: Name of educational organization and Tax exempt Number Course name and number Instructor's name Because many park sites have scheduled other activities on weekends, the student should plan in advance and have alternate dates in mind when applying for a student film permit. NPS has designed the student permit to minimize the costs by eliminating many of the activities that generate the need for intense monitoring. Student projects may not involve: Access to interiors of structures not available to the public Night filming Set construction Oversized vehicles or equipment Pyrotechnics, firearms, or weapons (real or fake), or stunts Generators\/artificial lighting Foggers Playback or sound exceeding 70 decibels Animals You may contact the Special Use Permits Office by e-mail: Special Use Permits.",
