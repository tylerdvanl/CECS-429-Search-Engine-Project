These pages contain information to help plan a trip and details on the educational programs the park offers.  If you are interested in a Ranger-led program, details for specific programs can be found on the ranger guided webpage. Contact the park, either by phone or fax, to let us know what you would like to do for your program. If your group is larger than 40 people, scheduling programs on two different days may be necessary due to staffing. After we receive information from you, we will check our scheduling calendar and staffing situation for the dates you are interested in. A staff member will contact you to let you know if we can assist you with your request. Educational programs are generally limited to 20-25 students per park ranger depending on age. Programs require adult supervision from your organization (generally one adult per ten children). Programs will start and end at the agreed upon time. Group programs are generally scheduled Monday through Friday. Due to prescheduled programs on Saturday and Sunday for the general public, weekend requests can rarely be filled. All programs are free, but reservations are required for guided ranger hikes. Groups should schedule with us at least two weeks in advance. Three to four weeks in advance is ideal, since dates fill quickly, especially in the early fall and late spring. Schools and other educatioinal institutions visiting the park for educational purposes may be eligible for a fee waiver. Fee waiver application.
