    "body": "Three Mile Access Trail       At the west end of the Three Mile Parking Area, near the pit toilet, follow the gravel path along the Bighorn River. The gravel ends at a two track road. Travel along the road for a short distance to a well trodden foot path that skirts the field back to the river. The trail ends in a grove of  cottonwoods with giant downed logs perfect for watching the graceful casting of the fly fishermen that come from all over to enjoy the world class fishery supported by the Bighorn River. It is also a tranquil setting to watch the ducks floating by or just listen to the sounds of nature",
