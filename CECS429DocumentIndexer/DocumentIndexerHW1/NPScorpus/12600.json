    "body": "Air Quality -- Acidic Deposition         A solar powered, aerochemetric rain sampler and rain gauge collect precipitation and dry atmospheric deposition data at Emerald Lake in Sequoia National Park. NPS Photo  High-elevation lakes and streams in the parks are potentially sensitive to human-induced acid deposition (acidic rain, snow, and particles). While chronic acidification is not a problem at present, there are episodes when the capacity of our lakes and streams to neutralize acids gets reduced -- during snowmelt and during the \"dirty\" rainstorms of summer and early fall -- and the water becomes acidic for a time. If acid deposition increases in the future, a likely scenario given the tremendous population growth in the San Joaquin Valley, these episodes of acidification will become more frequent and can be expected to alter our aquatic ecosystems.
