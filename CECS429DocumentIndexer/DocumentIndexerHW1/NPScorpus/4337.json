Once home to the famed Cocolobo Club, a retreat for people like Carl Fisher, Gar Wood, and Presidents Harding, Hoover, Johnson and Nixon, Adams Key is now a day-use area open from dawn until dusk. A short trail leads through the hardwood hammock, and a picnic pavilion and toilets are also available. There are also two park ranger families living on the island.",
