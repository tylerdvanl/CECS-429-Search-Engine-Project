    "body": "Extended Trip Information       If you have several days: An extended trip is the best way to experience the peace, solitude, and natural rhythms of the islands. Hike the wooded trails, explore the historic sites, or just sit by a campfire and listen to yodeling loons. Any camping trip should begin with a stop at the park's Bayfield visitor center where visitors can discuss their itineraries with a park ranger and pick up camping permits. Campers in need of transportation can travel to Stockton Island on regularly scheduled cruises from late June to Labor Day. Water taxi services are available to carry campers to the less visited islands. Although camping is allowed on 18 of the islands, almost half of the camping in the park occurs on Stockton Island. A park ranger presents campfire programs near Stockton's Presque Isle Visitor Center some nights during the summer season. Ranger-guided walks may also be offered on Stockton.",
