Join us for an all day workshop and field trip to the Tule Lake Unit where they will learn how to access and use primary source materials to develop analysis and reasoning skills. Join us for an informative and dynamic exchange about the incarceration of Japanese Americans across the Pacific West. Utilizing a regional perspective, we will dispel the current narrative of a single experience for the Japanese Americans as we draw deeper conclusions and understanding of how and why this injustice took place.
