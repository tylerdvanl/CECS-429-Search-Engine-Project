NPS\/Kodak photo by Neil Montanus  National Parks provide more than a place for recreation and relaxation. They are places where we can learn science and history lessons in real life settings. Biscayne National Park provides a perfect outdoor classroom with its four interrelated natural systems and cultural resources spanning 10,000 years. It is a place where a mainland mangrove shoreline, a shallow bay, the northern Florida Keys and living coral reef intermingle. The Environmental Education Program works to cultivate an appreciation of our natural world, leading to the preservation of Biscayne's natural resources along the southeastern edge of the Florida peninsula and ultimately the environment as a whole. We are excited for you and your students to begin to plan a field trip and embark on the adventure of exploring one of over 400 National Park Units in the country! As you will soon discover, Biscayne National Park is a treasure chest filled with gold, silver, emeralds, and diamonds. Let us take you there!",
