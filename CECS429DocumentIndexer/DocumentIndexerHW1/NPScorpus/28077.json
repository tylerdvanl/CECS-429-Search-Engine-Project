The year 1865 was enormously challenging for Andrew Johnson. He inherited a chaotic, war-weary nation and a devastated South. Since the spring of that year, President Johnson had been able to carry out his own vision of a reunified country and a reconstructed south.

The temporary exhibit at the site Visitor Center will explore the social and political atmosphere of the period, as well as introduce the major players during one of the most pivotal times in our national history. The Visitor Center is open from 9:00 - 5:00 daily, with the exception of Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's Day.        Blue Star Museum logo arts.gov   The Andrew Johnson National Historic Site is participating in the Blue Star Museum program.

For she had taught him the rudiments of the education which he had.\"  And from Johnson's remarks at the Tennessee State Fair (1857): \"I tell you, my fellow-citizens, the day is coming when it will be seen that the integrity of this government depends upon the education of our daughters.\"",
