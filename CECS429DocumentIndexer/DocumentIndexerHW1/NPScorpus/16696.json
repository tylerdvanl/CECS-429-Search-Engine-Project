Board of Education National Historic Site will host a candlelight vigil to honor the memories of the victims of gun violence at 5 p.m. on January 8. All members of the community are invited to attend. Park Superintendent David Smith will lead the vigil. The historic site recognizes the destructive effect gun violence has had on park neighbors with the recent shooting at Mo's Express. The vigil will also provide an opportunity for park staff to honor the memory of National Park Service Ranger Margaret Anderson, who died in the line of duty on New Year's Day. Anderson was shot to death at Mount Rainier National Park as she attempted to stop her eventual killer from proceeding into a crowded park with multiple firearms. These two tragic events are sad reminders that gun violence can affect any community and any neighborhood. January 8 also marks the one-year anniversary of the shooting of Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and others in a Tucson area shopping center that resulted in six deaths. Candlelight vigils will be held across the nation to educate the public of the dangers of gun violence and to honor the memories of those lost. Brown v.

Board Release date: February 23, 2012 Contact: Justin Sochacki Phone number: (785) 354-4273 Topeka, KS - Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site will celebrate African American History Month with the opening of a new art exhibit. Charles Anderson: My Art Therapy Journey features paintings and photographs of local artist and art therapist Charles Anderson. The exhibit is free and open to the public daily through March 31 and for the First Friday Artwalk from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. on March 2. Stories of struggle and discrimination are part of the fabric of our nation's history. They live on in the memories and experiences of those who witnessed the civil rights struggles of the 1960s and in the artwork of Charles Anderson. Anderson spent his career as an art therapist, helping people to deal with stress through creative expression, a therapy he also practiced himself. The photographs and paintings are works created to overcome the stress and struggle of a life lived through the civil rights movement. Each work is also paired with musical selections and the poetry of collaborator Gregory B. Dawson. Charles Anderson began his career in art therapy in 1962 when he began working at the Menninger Clinic. One year later he was drafted into the U.S. Army and stationed in Alaska, where he served as a Recreation Specialist and began conducting classes in photography, ceramics, lapidary, and leather crafts. After his return to Topeka, Anderson earned a Fine Arts degree from Washburn University and became a registered and board-certified art therapist. He worked at the Menninger Clinic until 2003. He has also served as an adjunct instructor of art therapy at Washburn, Emporia State, and Avila Universities. He currently works as a part-time art therapist for Stormont Vail West Hospital. Charles Anderson: My Art Therapy Journey will also be open on March 2 for the First Friday Artwalk from 5 to 9 p.m. Anderson and Dawson will be onsite during the Artwalk to discuss their works and the stories that inspired them.

Kansas First Lady Visits After-school Program Date: April 18, 2012 Every Friday children from Williams Science and Fine Arts Magnet School walk a few blocks to Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site to participate in after-school enrichment activities. Park staff and volunteers provide and facilitate reading programs, art projects, outdoor activities, and curriculum based programs. On April 20, third graders arrived and were met by Kansas First Lady Mary Brownback. Mrs. Brownback visited with the children and read Of Thee I Sing, a children's book written by President Barack Obama. The students are participants in an afterschool program called Families Empowered by Additional Teaching of Students (FEATS). FEATS targets children at low-performing schools living in poverty. Over 85% of the children attending Williams receive free and low cost lunches and nearly half those students are reading below state standards. Jointly administered by the Williams School and the YWCA, FEATS focuses on providing healthy snacks, exercise, literacy, and educational enrichment programs. The program has been very well received by students, school social workers, and park staff. \"Having the first lady read to these children about the role of civil rights in their lives will be something that they will never forget,\" said park Superintendent David Smith. \"She generously shared her time to help enrich their minds and share stories about people - just like these kids - who had the courage to stand up for what was right and help change the world. What better place to have this discussion than at the park where a few committed parents helped rock the very foundation of our country's educational system.\"      Got a Story? Brown v. Board Announces Oral History Project at 58th Anniversary Event Release date: May 9, 2012 Contact: Justin Sochacki Phone number: (785) 354-4273 Topeka, KS - The community has been talking and the National Park Service has been listening. Topekans want to see their stories told at their national park. We invite you to join us at 2 p.m. on May 17 to commemorate the 58th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education and learn about the park's new Oral History Project. Governor Sam Brownback will be issuing a proclamation formally apologizing for the State's policy of racial segregation in education. The proclamation will be presented at the event by Dr. Mildred Edwards, Executive Director of the Kansas African American Affairs Commission. The event is free and open to the public. After musical selections by the Williams Science and Fine Arts Magnet School Choir, attorney Charles Scott, Jr. will discuss the role his family played in the fight to end segregation in Kansas schools. Mr. Scott is a third generation attorney whose father and grandfather battled segregation in Kansas courtrooms for the first half of the 20th century. The National Park Service seeks to facilitate connections between those who lived this history and a nation of children that must learn its lessons. The Brown v. Board of Education Oral History Project will capture the stories of community members that relate to the historic Brown decision. The park is interested in recording memories, recollections, and experiences of people living in Topeka between 1940 and 1970, including stories about schools, neighborhoods, work life, and community activities. Park staff will be onsite to sign up community members that want to share their stories in a formal oral history interview that will be scheduled for a later date. We are particularly interested in hearing about the experiences of teachers and students at Topeka public schools, both before and after the Brown decision in 1954. The individual oral histories will become part of the Brown v. Board of Education Oral History Project. Oral histories provide future students and researchers a record of history that can only be found in the people who lived it. Though national in its significance, the case affected the Topeka community, and if the stories of this historic event are not preserved, then they will be forever untold. Please share this announcement far and wide. As always, the event is free and open to all. If you cannot attend on May 17 but would still like to share your stories, please contact Park Historian Thom Rosenblum at (785) 354-4273 ext. 234 or email by clicking here.

The work of many artists has also assisted in providing perspectives at parks that create meaningful experiences for our visitors. And creating art can be a powerful way to learn the stories of the past, especially for children. Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site is pleased to announce that quilt artist Marla A. Jackson will be the park's first Artist in Residence. For the next four months, Ms. Jackson will collaborate with park staff to engage youth and audiences in art programs that will connect visitors to stories of the struggle for equality. Ms. Jackson will assist with art projects for five weeks of summer camps that will bring students from Topeka, Lawrence, and Kansas City area Boys and Girls Clubs to learn about the struggle for civil rights in Kansas by visiting historic sites and engaging in art projects. One of eight children born to Fern Eaton Crum and Rufus Crum, Jr., originally from Royal Oak Township in Michigan, Ms. Jackson spent many weekends and summers with her paternal grandparents, Rufus and Zelma Crum, and her once enslaved great-grandmother, Lucille Crum. Ms. Jackson's artistic direction was influenced by her family's stories, and her quilts depict scenes and themes that capture the pride, spirit, pain, and joy of the African American experience. Her primary goal with her work is to echo the untold stories of heroes that history has overlooked, forgotten, or hidden. Painting the landscapes of the American West, visual artists like George Catlin and Albert Bierstadt focused attention on natural wonders in the western landscape, then unfamiliar to the eastern populace. These visual records of early artists helped to stimulate the establishment of many of our first national parks. Today, artists from a wide variety of mediums draw upon the multifaceted quality of parks for inspiration. Artists like Ms. Jackson translate the national park's purpose, as a place that preserves our nation's struggle for equality, into images and projects that bring a deeper understanding of the legacy of Brown v. Board of Education to youth. Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site tells the story of the U.S. Supreme Court decision that ended legal segregation in public schools.

Over 1300 visitors enjoyed a range of activities at the park on Saturday. \"Being able to connect with new audiences is such an important part of our function as a National Park.

Kids earned the park's new Civil War to Civil Rights trading cards by participating in a variety of activities including printmaking, team-building games, and museum activities. Kids and grown-ups alike enjoyed programs provided by the Topeka Zoo and a visit from the area bookmobile. Former NPS ranger and award winning storyteller Bobby Norfolk entertained all with his dynamic stories.

Ranger David Carter organized the event. \"As a former law enforcement officer, I know that good 'thank you's' from citizens are few and far between,\" said Carter. \"We really wanted to show our appreciation to our military, police, and fire on Labor Day and in remembrance of the tragedy on September 11.\" At just under two acres, Brown v. Board of Education NHS relies on an extensive regional trail system to supplement the park's outdoor recreational venues.

Board of Education NHS Date: September 20, 2012 Education Secretary Arne Duncan spoke for approximately 15 minutes about the necessity of closing the opportunity gap in education and the importance of continued investment in educational opportunities for all Americans. Referring to the formerly segregated Monroe School as \"hallowed ground,\" Secretary Duncan commented that \"Brown v. Board of Education is not just a part of our history; it has to be part of our future as well.\" The program kicked off with the Topeka High School drumline and the Williams Science and Fine Arts Magnet School choir offered up \"Home on the Range,\" the state song of Kansas. The Secretary was preceded by speakers that included Topeka mayor William Bunten, Kansas Education Commissioner Diane DeBacker, National Education Association President Dennis Van Roekel, and Highland Park High School Principal Dr. Beryl New. The Secretary was then introduced by high school students Jewlissa Frickey and McKenna Miller, whose National History Day film on WWII Japanese-American internment camps is currently on display at the park. Prior to the public program, law students from Washburn University participated in a one hour town hall meeting at the park with Assistant Secretaries of Education Michael Yudin and Russlyn Ali. Approximately 50 high school students also toured the exhibits and participated in ranger led education programs before joining the law students and Department of Education officials for a second hour of dialogue and discussion. \"What better place than Brown v. Board of Education NHS to tell the story of segregation in education,\" said park superintendent David Smith. \"Secretary Duncan made it very clear that we are facing a crisis in education today. We are thrilled that the park could be part of a renewed focus on the role of education in American society.\" Given the extensive media coverage of the Secretary's visit, the public event also drew the attention of the Topeka based Westboro Baptist Church. The controversial church group regularly pickets the funerals of American soldiers to publicize their views against homosexuality. Several members of the church demonstrated and exercised their constitutional rights under the First Amendment with signs, placards, and songs just off park property. They demonstrated without incident and left shortly before the Secretary's arrival.      Student Art Exhibit Inspired by Aaron Douglas Opens for First Friday Artwalk Date: October 1, 2012 Contact: Joan Wilson Phone: (785) 354-4273 Topeka, KS - An exhibition of student art inspired by Aaron Douglas will open as part of the First Friday Artwalk at 5:00 p.m. on Friday, October 5.\"The Ray of Hope\" consists of quilts and murals  created by fourth graders from Williams Science and Fine Arts Magnet School and eighth graders from Liberty Central Middle School in Lawrence in collaboration with quilt artist Marla Jackson.

Board of Education NHS. Farr shared stories of his time in France and Italy from nearly 70 years ago with a crowd of high school seniors. NPS\/Angela Estep  Veterans Inspire Quilt Pieces Date: November 7, 2012 American war veterans from World War II as well as Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan engaged high school students at Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site as part of an effort to honor soldiers on Veterans Day. Whether it was hearing stories of combat in Afghanistan, facing battles in Normandy, or the monotony of marching and singing in cadence, the students left the park with a rich appreciation for American military service. Park staff partnered with the Dream Rocket Project so that they could better link students from the heartland with the conflicts and issues soldiers contend with beyond the American shores. Many of the soldiers connected their stories of fighting for freedom and democracy with the park's story of fighting for equality and world free of discrimination. High school art students were at the site to create quilt pieces that honored military service and could be displayed for Veterans Day. The quilts will eventually end up as part of a major art exhibit linking the exploration of space with community art programs. The Dream Rocket Project enlists the help of students worldwide to create a collage of quilt pieces that tell the stories of peace, freedom, equality and education and that will be sewn together in order to fully wrap a Saturn V Moon Rocket by June of 2014. Brown v. Board of Education NHS has partnered with program coordinator Jennifer Marsh to create hundreds of these quilt pieces. Marsh will need a total of 8,000 individual quilts in order to fully enshroud the Saturn rocket. Parks interested in working with Marsh to create Dream Rocket quilts can contact her by clicking here for more information.         Kwanzaa Celebration with Chocolate Me Illustrator Release date: December 14, 2012 Contact: Angela Estep Phone number: (785) 354-4273   Topeka, KS - Award-winning illustrator and storyteller Shane Evans will bring Kwanzaa to life on Friday, December 21, 2012, at Brown v.
