The staff at Valles Caldera is working hard to correct and resolve accessibility deficiencies throughout the preserve. By using principles of universal design, Valles Caldera is committed to providing physical access to the greatest number of individuals. From designing and building new facilities to the rehabilitation of older buildings, accessibility has become a key component of all projects.    The Visitor Center is wheelchair accessible.
