At 1.6 million acres, it is the third largest unit of the National Park System in the contiguous United States. While you won't be able to experience it all in a single visit, taking the time to plan ahead will ensure a safe and rewarding adventure. And remember: you can always come back...      Using GPS Navigation GPS Navigation in remote locations like Mojave National Preserve is notoriously unreliable. GPS maps aren't always up to date and sometimes lead travelers onto primitive or 4 -wheel drive roads that they are unprepared for. Travelers should always carry up-to-date road maps to check the accuracy of GPS directions. Use common sense before heading down a primitive dirt road in the desert. Do not depend only on your vehicle or other GPS navigation system.         Use Google Earth to Explore Mojave National Preserve  Explore Mojave National Preserve with \"Google Earth\" files to see roads and places.
