If you are seeking general information about Death Valley National Park, you may wish to explore other pages of this website or contact the park by mail (see address below) or by calling (760) 786-3200.  If the information you are seeking is not available through those routes, you will need to submit a written FOIA request. There is no official request form, just send us a letter describing the records you desire to:  Superintendent Death Valley National Park PO Box 579 Death Valley, CA 92328  You may also submit FOIA requests to the NPS or the DOI. If you have questions on what information is available without submitting a FOIA request or where it may be located, contact one of the NPS or DOI FOIA Contacts. Our responsibility is to provide you with copies of the documents you are entitled to receive under the law. We want to work with you to achieve that goal.
