Dogs must be on a leash of 6 feet or less in length and their owners must be holding the other end. It's not only for your pet's protection but those of wildlife and farm animals.    3) \"I can't flush!\" Please be considerate of other visitors and clean up after your pet. Disposable waste pickup bags are available at a few park locations, with trash cans at or very near the bag dispensers.    4) \"Oooh! New people to meet!\" Your pet might want to meet others, but please remember that some people may be nervous around dogs.",
