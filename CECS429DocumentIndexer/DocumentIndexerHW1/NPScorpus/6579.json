Quarry A was the first fossil locality worked by Olaf A. Peterson of the Carnegie Museum. The three named plant species are native to western Nebraska's short- and mixed-grass prairies. A National Park Service photograph. Photo by Fred MacVaugh.  Curious to know what you might see and explore at Agate Fossil Beds National Monument? We wouldn't blame you if you were; in fact, we'd encourage you to browse the sampling of landscape and collections images found in our photo gallery. We must confess, however, that no photograph worth even a thousand words could conceivably capture the wonderfully beautiful and shocking wide-open spaces that surround and contain the monument's famed fossil quarries. Even the details, the photographs of plants and wildlife, leave one wanting to feel the wind brushing your sun-warmed skin as you walk the park's hiking trails. Not to be missed either is the monument's one-of-a-kind museum collections featuring 20-million-year-old fossil mammals and gifts the Cook family, owners of the historic Agate Springs Ranch, received from Chief Red Cloud of the Oglala Lakota, who visited often with family and friends in the late 1800s and early 1900s.",
