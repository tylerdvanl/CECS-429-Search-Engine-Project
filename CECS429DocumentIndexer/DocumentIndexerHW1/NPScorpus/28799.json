NPS Photo  Steamtown NHS occupies about 40 acres of the former Scranton yards of the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad. The entire yard is open whenever the park is open.  Within this area, there are multiple opportunities for outdoor activities. There are tables and benches outside the museum complex, available seasonally, for picnic lunches or just relaxing. Outdoor walking tours may be offered, as well as train rides outside our Park boundaries! When you visit Steamtown NHS, check at the Visitor Center to learn about that day's scheduled activities, as our online calendar can change on short notice!",
