    "title": "Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area: Shoreline Management Plan",
    "body": "Shoreline Management Plan       The 2001 General Management Plan (GMP) for Lake Roosevelt established overall strategies for meeting the general goals and purposes of Lake Roosevelt. Since that time, other management issues have surfaced that are not adequately addressed in the GMP, including the increase in private development along the shoreline, crowding of existing facilities, beach camping, and disposal of human waste.   The Shoreline Management Plan tiers from the goals and objectives established by the GMP and provides for the level of detail needed to address these and other shoreline management issues. Visit this page to see the Finding of No Significant Impact for the Shoreline Management Plan. Please contact the park or visit the NPS PEPC website if interested in a hard copy or electronic version of the complete Lake Roosevelt NRA Shoreline Management Plan.",
