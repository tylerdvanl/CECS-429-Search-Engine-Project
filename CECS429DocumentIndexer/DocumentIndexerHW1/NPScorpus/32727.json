    "body": "How to Apply       National Park Service job opportunities come in the form of vacancy announcements. Applicants must submit a specific application, within a specific time frame, for every position available. Vacancy announcements are available at USAJobs.  Before you apply, review the entire vacancy announcement carefully. (Some positions require supplemental forms or request specific documentation\/proof of information.) Get your application postmarked by the closing date. Sometimes the applications must be received by the closing date--so read the announcement carefully. Generally, extensions will not be given. Your application will not be returned to you (whether or not you are hired). If you want a copy, make it before you send it into the personnel office.  Application tips Preparing a resume for a National Park Service job is a little different than preparing one for other employers. When applying for federal jobs, it is better to:  Include the specific dates you worked. Be sure to list the amount of time you worked - for example, part-time or full-time - and the number of hours. Rather than providing an overview of your work, describe the complexity and details of the jobs you worked. Unlike most resume-writing books, explain in detail your duties. Specify the amount of supervision you received.  Several-page-long resumes are common! Here are some suggestions to apply for a job with North Cascades National Park Complex and other National Park Service units. Submission requirements may vary depending on the announcement, so be sure to check with the personnel office announcing the position for specific requirements.
