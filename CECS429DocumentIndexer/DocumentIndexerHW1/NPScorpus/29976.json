It's amazing how bright the stars can look on a clear moonless night. Or how big the moon can look as it rises over the ocean. To best experience the night sky, Fire Island National Seashore offers opportunities for overnight stays at its Watch Hill and Sailors Haven marinas. Properly equipped boats may also anchor overnight within park boundaries in the Great South Bay. Camping is permitted at the walk-in Watch Hill Campground  and by permit in the Otis Pike Fire Island High Dune Wilderness. Many of the Fire Island communities also provide rental opportunities or other lodging options for non-residents. Late-night ferries to and from some of the Fire Island communities can provide a small window of opportunity to experience the island's night sky, but you have to carefully watch your time. Logistical details are a major part of life on Fire Island. You may drive to either end of Fire Island, where parking is available at Smith Point County Park and at Robert Moses State Park. However, these parking lots may close sooner than you would like in order to watch the night sky.         Learn More Visit the National Park Service's Nature & Science website to learn more about Natural Lightscapes.       Fire Island National Seashore occasionally offers evening programs about astronomy and the night sky.   Check program schedules for current opportunities.",
