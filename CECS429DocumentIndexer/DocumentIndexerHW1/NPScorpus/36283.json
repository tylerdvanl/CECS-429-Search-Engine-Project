In October, during Texas Archeology Month, we also offer ranger-guided hikes to the Antelope Creek Village excavation site.

The Alibates Visitor Center also has an NPS passport cancellation station with stamps for both Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument and Lake Meredith National Recreation Area. We also offer a Junior Ranger program for both Alibates and Lake Meredith.        Native American demonstration garden with plants such as corn, beans, squash, and melons. NPS Photo  Outside, you may visit the Alibates Interpretive Garden or take a 10-minute self-guided hike on the Mesquite Trail, which winds around a small mesa adjacent to the garden. Other nearby areas of interest include McBride Canyon and Mullinaw Trails area, both accessible by turning onto Cas Johnson Road from Highway 136, then turning left at the large sign that says \"McBride Canyon.\" (The Mullinaw area lies several miles beyond McBride Canyon and is accessible only by an unpaved and rough road that can be muddy after rain. Proceed with extreme caution.)To reach the Mullinaw Trails, stay on main dirt road and continue in southwesterly direction when road forks. Other things to do in the immediate area include driving a short distance from the Visitor Center to Bates Canyon, site of an old Lake Meredith boat ramp. Here you can view a now-dry section of the lake bed and look for wildlife in the heavy undergrowth at the foot of the boat ramp. You also may take the paved road that goes past the Alibates parking lot. The two-mile road winds up and over several mesas, giving some interesting views of the landscape and the monument from a distance. You also may choose to turn on Dolomite Point Road (marked with a small wooden sign), and take a dirt road to see additional views of the area, including a \"chimney\" formation (dirt road will fork -- take left-hand fork). CAUTION: Dolomite Point Road is unpaved, rough, and potentially muddy in damp weather. Proceed with extreme caution.       Alibates Visitor Contact Station in winter NPS photo         Plum Creek campground, on West side of Lake Meredith National Recreation Area NPS Photo  CAMPING INFORMATION: Camping is available nearby at Lake Meredith National Recreation Area.
