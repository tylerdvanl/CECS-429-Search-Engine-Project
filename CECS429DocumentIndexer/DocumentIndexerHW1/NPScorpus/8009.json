Agricultural lands along the parkway are leased through a Special Use Permit for a period of 5 years. In permitting agricultural use of National Park Service lands, the parkway is required to foster practices, which conserve soil, protect streams and groundwater, control exotic plant species, and avoid toxic contamination of the environment. Agricultural Lease holders are generally required to mow agricultural leases and fence lines at least once a year to control weeds and exotic plant species (e.g. thistle, multiflora rose, etc.). A list of lands available for lease and a copy of the Special Use Permit conditions may be requested by mail from Tom Davis, Blue Ridge Parkway, 1670 Blue Ridge Parkway, Floyd, VA 24091. Those interested in leasing the farmland following review of the Special Use Permit conditions, may obtain an application from the same location listed above. To have an application mailed to you or for further information, please contact Tom Davis at 540-745-9663 or via e-mail.",
