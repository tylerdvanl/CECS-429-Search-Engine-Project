They began their week with an introductory program presented by a Park Ranger. The week ended with a trip to the historic site, where the students participated in a service program and helped beautify the site. NPS Photo    Park Rangers in the Classroom   Although nothing compares to an in-person visit to the actual site, a field trip may not be practical or possible for your school or organization. You can invite a Park Ranger to come to your classroom and present a curriculum-based education program for your students.  The presentation can be used as an introduction to the subject matter, an overview, or to help prepare the students for their visit to the actual Minidoka Relocation Center site.  Note that the scheduling of Park Rangers depends on staff availability. Due to limited resources, we try to maximize our impact during outreach events so we are happy to offer multiple sessions to accommodate all of your students. Park Ranger programs are free of charge. Contact the Education Specialist to schedule a visit.",
