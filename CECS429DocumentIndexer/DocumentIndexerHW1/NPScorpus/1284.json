    "body": "Ranger Thoughts        Hi, my name is Chelsea and I work in the Interpretation Division at Rocky, and I am in my second year as a permanent ranger.

NPS photo  March 17th, 2012 Liquid GOLD It has been a weird winter as of yet, and the snow has let up from last year, but the winter winds have stayed ferocious! The wind's powerful blow fogs the ridgeline by whipping snow around the peaks, and it shows its strength by knocking over big old trees. Please continue to be cautious of trees when traveling in Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) if you go hiking on really windy days. Although westerly winds continue to rip through the park, we are not seeing nearly as much snowfall, especially compared to last year's record setting snowpack (check out the Colorado Snow Survey).       On windy days the peaks of the Rockies fog over with snow.  NPS photo         A frozen Grace Falls in the winter will create a gushing waterfall come spring! NPS VIP photo  Having lots of snow is necessary for RMNP because of its ability to sustain living things. Perhaps the most influential thing about the snow is its transformation into water. Most of the park's moisture falls as snow, and in the west water is referred to as \"liquid gold\". Without sufficient water trees become more susceptible to insect infestations, boreal toads and tiger salamanders have a hard time finding suitable habit, and wildflowers can't put on their brilliant blooming show!  Although snow tends to be seen as an inconvenience, it is necessary to ensure the survival of many plants and animals, including ourselves.        The water from the East Inlet flows west, eventually converging with the Colorado River, then it all flows out to the Pacific Ocean.    NPS photo  Once snow melts it flows as water through the vein-like rivers and streams, and departs on a long journey back toward the ocean. RMNP hosts the headwaters of major rivers such as the Colorado River, the Big Thompson River, the Poudre River, and the North St. Vrain River. Along their routes, the rivers provide drinking water, and hydroelectric power for much of the United States. These rivers need the replenishment of water from the snowpack, and glaciers of the Rocky Mountains. About ~90% of the water feeding the Colorado River comes from the highlands of both Colorado and Wyoming. Globally, mountain ecosystems like RMNP provide about 50% of the fresh drinking water for the whole world!       The most snow falls above 9,000 feet in elevation, making the Bear Lake area a winter wonderland.  The snow typically stays around for 9 months out of the year. NPS photo       We can thank the park for many things, but fresh drinking water is not the typical one that comes to mind. There are a lot of things to appreciate about Rocky, and the protection of vital resources is one of them. RMNP was established not only to protect scenic views and wildlife, it is also here to conserve unpolluted water, clean air, and natural darkness that the park provides. Spring is the time where water will flow once more, and things will spring to life. Rocky just would not be the same place without the vibrant green grass of the open meadows, the sound of rushing water, and the colorful wildflowers that are a feast for the eyes. So next time you are in the park, you can thank the snow, for not only sustaining park life, but our lives as well!           You can join our digital community today, by clicking on the icons to the right. NPS Photo  January 31, 2012 Digital Media at Rocky The National Park Service is trying to increase the use of updated technology, and current social media, to reach new audiences and engage them in protecting our public lands. By keeping up-to-date in the high-tech 21st century, the NPS can stay relevant to today's visitor. Although in this day and age, this is no easy task! It is definitely a challenge to keep a balance between advancing the use of technology, while also providing the authentic experiences in nature that people seek in our national parks. There are many different ways to connect our audiences, and just recently we have turned to podcasts, webcams and social media. Nowadays, it is easy to experience the park right from your couch at home. But more importantly, through these avenues we hope to lure outside, so you can come and experience the wonders of Rocky Mountain National Park yourself. On this RMNP webpage, you can access lots of good information to prepare you for a great trip to the park. One of the newer resources in the webpage's Photos and Multimedia section are the podcasts and webcams. From finding out what to bring on a backcountry hike, to planning a big climb up Longs Peak, the podcasts cover many different topics and are a great way to prepare you for a trip to Rocky! Take some time to watch a few, and keep tuning in for more to come. Along with podcasts, on our park web page you can access multiple webcams. Take a peek at live park views to check in with the weather, catch a glimpse of some wildlife, or to simply enjoy a scenic window view. The endless natural beauty of RMNP is literally a mouse click away!        Diane 'dh' is a seasonal ranger who staffs the Information Office takes over updating our social media sites when Katy is out.
