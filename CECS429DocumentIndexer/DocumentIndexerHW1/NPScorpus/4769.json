This is what it looks like when a spherical image is unwrapped onto a flat plane.  View the virtual tour to see this image in its original, spherical, shape. Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS)  Virtual Tour Celebrates Two Anniversaries     In 2014, in anticipation of the Centennial of the National Park Service and the 50th Anniversary of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, the park staff began working with the NPS's Historic American Buildings Survey to develop a virtual tour of Ellis Island. The tour was completed and launched in late 2015. This virtual tour is primarily of the South Side of Ellis Island, the location of the historic hospital complex. These important structures are generally not available to the visitors. Explore this space virtually and see our buildings from a whole new point of view! Look behind the walls and windows of these historic structures to see how they were constructed and what the inside looks like today.     Take the Ellis Island Virtual Tour  This interactive virtual tour is a combination of high resolution spherical images, historical information, and historic images taken in the same areas decades ago, primarily of the South Side of Ellis Island. Also included are animated point cloud fly-throughs of Ellis Island as a whole. This virtual tour was created by the Heritage Documentation Programs.         Learn more about this Virtual Tour The following are buttons on the control bar along the bottom of the virtual tour screen.

HDP conducts a nationwide documentation program in partnership with state and local governments, private industry, preservation groups, and federal agencies.    Documentation produced through these programs constitutes the nation's largest archive of historical architectural, engineering and landscape documentation. Records on nearly 40,000 historic sites, consisting of large-format, black and white photographs, measured drawings, and written historical reports, are maintained in a special collection at the Library of Congress, available to the public copy-right free in both hard copy (in the Library of Congress) and electronic (via the Web) formats.    Documentation also enters the Collection through mitigation activities as per the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and through competitions and donations. These records provide a permanent record of the nation's most important historic sites, contributes to wider recognition and appreciation of historic resources, provides baseline documentation for rehabilitation and restoration, and makes available materials for interpretation and illustration.",
