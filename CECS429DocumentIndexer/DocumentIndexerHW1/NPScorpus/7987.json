The rock outcroppings high on the mountain and the relocated collection of 1890s farm buildings where settlers scratched out a living in the rocky soil makes Humpback Rocks perhaps the best representation of the varied combination of natural and cultural features anywhere along the Parkway corridor. The Maine-to-Georgia Appalachian Trail winds in and out of the Parkway throughout this section. The visitor center exhibits highlight many aspects of mountain life that defy popular and widespread stereotypes.
