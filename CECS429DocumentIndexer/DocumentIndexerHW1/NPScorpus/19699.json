    "body": "Canada Goose          The Canada Goose, Branta canadensis, is a very common sight along the Chattahoochee River corridor. These normally migratory birds have become a nuisance species because they are present year round and they strain the ecosystem. There are no natural predators for the Canada Goose, allowing populations to grow unchecked. A negative result of their booming populations is a large amount of waste that ends up in the river and elevates bacteria levels.In fact, a full-grown goose can leave up to two pounds of waste per day. This would not be a problem if the geese were only here while migrating, but because they are present year round, their waste can lead to higher levels of fecal coliform bacteria in the river.",
