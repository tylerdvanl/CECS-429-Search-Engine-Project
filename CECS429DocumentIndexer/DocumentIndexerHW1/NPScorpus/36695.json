Roanhorse October 6, 2015          The Queens Garden Trail beginning at Sunrise Point, descending 320 feet (98m), is considered the least difficult trail entering the canyon from the rim. Traveling this trail you will see many hoodoos, representative of garden like features. Using your imagination you may be able to see Queen Victoria at the end of a short spur trail, overseeing the garden before her.          Back to main Day Hikes page.
