A valid state fishing license is required for fishing even though the monument is federal land. Anglers are reminded that there are four endangered species of fish found in rivers in the monument: Colorado pikeminnow, razorback sucker, humpback chub, and bonytail. These fish should be immediately released with as little harm possible if caught. More information on these fish can be found at the Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery Program site.
