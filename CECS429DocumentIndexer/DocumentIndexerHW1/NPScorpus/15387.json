    "body": "Eppley Community Relations Project       Over the last few months, at the request of the National Park Service, the Eppley Institute for Parks and Public Lands has been working with the communities of Beverly Shores, Ogden Dunes, Dune Acres and Porter Beach to find out how the communities work with Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore and identify issues of concern and potential solutions from local citizens.  In early October there were a series of three public meetings. The compiled notes from the meetings are now posted at www.nps.gov\/indu\/management\/partners\/Eppley along with survey questions and responses taken this past summer. As a result of the October meetings, it was determined that there needed to be a continuing dialog.  The next public meetings will be:  Ogden Dunes – Nov. 3 (7-9pm), Ogden Dunes Fire Station Dune Acres\/Porter Beach – Nov. 8 (3-5pm), Dune Acres Town Hall Beverly Shores – Nov. 9 (7-9pm), Beverly Shores Town Hall  Citizens are welcome to come to any or all of the three meetings. Thank you for your interest in Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore.      Beverly Shores Meeting Notes (Sep 28, 2009) Ogden Dunes Meeting Notes (Sep 29, 2009) Dune Acres\/Porter Beach Meeting Notes (Oct 1, 2009) Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore Civic Engagement of Neighboring Communities Park Meeting Notes (Nov, 09)",
