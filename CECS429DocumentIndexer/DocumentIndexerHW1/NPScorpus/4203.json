A quiet walk down one of the boardwalk trails, a tram ride through Shark Valley, or a boat tour of Florida Bay or the Ten Thousand Islands will let you experience the Everglades firsthand. With patience and luck you might glimpse wading birds, deer, or the park's most sought after residents -- alligators. Information is available at visitor centers about places to stop and activities to try. Don't let your memories of the Everglades be framed by a car window!      Biking The best bicycling areas are at Shark Valley, the Snake Bight Trail near Flamingo, and along the Long Pine Key Nature Trail. Bird Watching Whether you spot a single blue heron or an entire flock of roseate spoonbills, birdwatching is one of the most rewarding activities in the Everglades. Boating Most of the park is only accessible by water making boating a popular way to experience the Everglades. Whether you own a boat, are renting one, or are taking one of the tours that leave from Flamingo and the Gulf Coast, boating brings you closer to the park's wild wonders. Camping The Everglades offers both frontcountry camping and backcountry camping. Long Pine Key and Flamingo campgrounds offer drinking water, picnic tables, grills, restrooms, and tent and trailer sites. Showers and electric hookups are available at Flamingo.
