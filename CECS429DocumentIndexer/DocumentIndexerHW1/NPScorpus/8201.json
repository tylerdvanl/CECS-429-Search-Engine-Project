With over 700 miles of trail providing outstanding opportunities for both short hikes and extended backpacking trips, there is something for everyone interested.  Hikers need to assume individual responsibility for planning their trips and hiking safely. Before setting out on your hike, stop by a park visitor center to obtain needed warnings and recommendations. You will increase your odds of a safe hike, decrease your disturbance to park wildlife, and lessen cumulative damage to resources.      Trail Maps Good day hikes are plentiful. For a list of hikes (including distances and elevation gain) see our Day Hikes in Glacier publication or visit the following pages listing hikes by district. Area maps are included on each page.  Lake McDonald Many Glacier including Logan Pass North Fork & Goat Haunt St. Mary including Logan Pass Two Medicine   Return to Top        Trail Status Detailed reports on trail status are available on our Trail Status page. Trails, backcountry campgrounds, and other areas of the park that have closures are listed on our Trail and Area Closure page. The reports are updated each morning or anytime new information is obtained. A rule of thumb, earlier in the summer, lower elevation trails and trails near the boundary of Glacier National Park are snow free. By mid to late July, trails in the higher elevations, over mountain passes and on the Continental Divide are snow free.  Return to Top        Day Hike Planning Visitor center staff will be happy to assist you with your choices and discuss popular trails in park. Check the Ranger-led Activity Guide to find out when you can join a ranger on trail. Nature Trails Some self-guided walks interpret trailside features with brochures and signs. The Trail of the Cedars, Forest and Fire, Hidden Lake, Running Eagle Falls, and Swiftcurrent Nature Trails encourage hikers to experience Glacier National Park at their own pace. The Trail of the Cedars and Running Eagle Falls trails are wheelchair accessible. Day Trip Plan If you are taking a day hike, please consider completing the voluntary Day Trip Plan form and leaving it with the front desk of your hotel or a traveling companion that is not hiking with you. This voluntary form can help you plan your trip and could be a valuable tool for search and rescue efforts if needed. Completion of this form does not mean a search will be initiated for you if you do not return. However, if you are reported overdue from a hike, this document would help search personnel concentrate search efforts along your intended route saving critical time and possibly reducing risks to those that go looking for you. If you are staying inside the park, you are welcome to leave a copy of this form with your hotel's front desk. All forms will be destroyed 30 days after the date completed. Again, this form is not intended to imply that our hotel concessioner or the National Park Service will be monitoring your return and does not mean a search will be initiated. If a search is initiated because others reported you overdue, the National Park Service will check with the hotels to see if a Day Trip Plan was filed and use it to help focus their search efforts. Plan well and enjoy your hike! Additional Planning Resources We have flickr photo albums of some popular hikes. Visitor center bookstores carry a complete line of trail guides, topographic maps and field guides to aid the hiker. Publications are also available by mail. Visit the Glacier National Park Conservancy online store.  Return to Top        Overnight Trips Hikers planning to camp overnight in Glacier's backcountry must stop at the Agpar Backcountry Office, St. Mary Visitor Center, or other ranger station to obtain a backcountry permit. Visit our Backcountry Camping page for in-depth information about backcountry camping. Return to Top        Guided Hike Service There are chances to hike with a ranger in both summer and winter. In addition to guided hikes with a ranger, Glacier Guides offer guided hikes for both overnight and day hikes. See the Guided Hiking page for contact information to schedule a trip. Both rangers and boat captains guide hikes as part of certain boat tours.  Return to Top",
