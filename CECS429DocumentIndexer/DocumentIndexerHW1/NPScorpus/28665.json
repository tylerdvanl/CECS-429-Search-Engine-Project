    "body": "Bridle Trails at Gettysburg              There are designated bridle trails for horseback riding throughout the park. The park does not offer horseback rides but they are available through several commercial business in the Gettysburg area. Visit Destination Gettysburg for further information. For the safety of both animal and rider, protection of other visitors and park resources, riders must remain on designated horse trails at all times. For visitors who bring their own horses to the park, limited trailer parking is available at McMillan Woods Youth Group Campground on West Confederate Avenue. There is a designated section of the parking area in the campground for vehicles and trailers. On weekends during spring, summer and fall, the parking area for horse trailers can fill up quickly. Since parking is limited it is best to arrive early. Once the lot is full, there are no other places for trailers to park on the battlefield. If that happens, horse riders need to be flexible and consider other horse riding venues in the area: BRIDLE TRAILS CLOSE TO GETTYSBURG Catoctin National Park, Thurmont, MD, (301) 663-9288 web site: http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/cato\/ Large Parking area - 5 trails totaling 30 miles.
