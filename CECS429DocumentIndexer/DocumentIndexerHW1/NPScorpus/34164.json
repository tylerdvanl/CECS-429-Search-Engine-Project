Since 1870, local residents have found the remains of at least two-dozen soldiers, but there are undoubtedly more. After the war, Congress expanded the eligibility requirements for burials in the national cemeteries to include people such as Private Evander Willis, who fought in the war at the age of 18, survived, and lived until October 1935, decades after the Civil War ended. In the 1930s, at the 75th anniversary of the war, only about 10,000 veterans were still alive. With the new changes Congress allowed, veterans like Willis found their final resting places in the Fredericksburg National Cemetery, receiving Civil War-style headstones like they would have if they had died during the war. One hundred and fifty years after its establishment, the cemetery is closed to burials but serves as a place of reflection for the thousands who visit every year to honor the soldiers who defended their country.                        Annual National Cemetery Illumination 2016 - Stop #2 Stop #2 tells the story of Private Evander Willis, the last Civil War veteran to be buried in the National Cemetery.
