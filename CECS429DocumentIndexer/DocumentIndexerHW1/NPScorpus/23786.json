Photo by Sally King  A paved road leads from the entrance to the campground, Visitor Center, and a picnic area. Access to the archeological sites is by foot. The main trail is 1.2 miles round-trip. Portions of the trail are relatively flat and permit access by wheelchair. Other parts include stairs and a chance to climb ladders into cavates. An additional mile round-trip walk leads to Alcove House which is reached by climbing 4 ladders and a number of stone stairs. Winter weather can limit what areas can be visited.  Approximately 70 miles of backcountry trails are available for day or overnight foot travel (wilderness permit required for overnight use; available at visitor center).",
