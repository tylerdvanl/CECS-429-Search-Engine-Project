    "body": "Public Involvement       Roger Williams National Memorial Cultural Landscape Report In collaboration with the Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation and the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry, the National Park Service has developed a Cultural Landscape Report (CLR) for Roger Williams National Memorial. This is the first report of its kind done for the Memorial since its establishment by Congress in 1965. The CLR includes an extensive site history that outlines, in depth, Native American presence, the settlement of Roger Williams, and the urban renewal period that resulted in the Memorial as we know it today. In addition, the report includes a comprehensive site analysis and evaluation as well as treatment recommendations for the future use and design of the site. The park has entered a critical phase with the development of this foundational document. Over the next several months, park management will be working on an implementation plan based on the recommendations found in the plan and rooted in public process.
