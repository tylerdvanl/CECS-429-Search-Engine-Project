National parks in the San Francisco Bay region, including the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, house an amazing richness of biological diversity due to the variety of habitats and unique geology of the area. Over half of the bird species of North America and nearly one third of California's plant species are found within the park's legislative boundaries. Of those, over 40 are listed as federally threatened or endangered. The Recreation Area is spread through a 60-mile swath of coastal lands, with inholdings by other agencies and private owners incorporated into the park's legislative boundaries. Because of the multiple landowners, many Bay Area residents and park visitors think of our park in terms of isolated sites such as Muir Woods, Stinson Beach, the Marin Headlands, and the Presidio. The bigger picture is one of wildlife corridors, secret nature spots, and refuges for rarities. Traveling through the park connects you with windswept beaches, dramatic cliffs, coastal chaparral, low mountains, swaths of prairie, live oak woodlands, salt marshes, freshwater wetlands and creeks, and redwood forests. All you have to do is get out and explore!         Restoration & Management Managers are working to stop habitat loss and preserve local biological diversity. Learn more about park restoration and monitoring projects at locations such as Crissy Field, Fort Baker, The Presidio, Mori Point, and Muir Beach!         San Francisco Bay Area National Parks Nature & Science The many National Park Service programs and partners in the Bay Area are dedicated to understanding and preserving the region's unique resources through science and education. Find information about these resources and about scientific activities and research underway. And check out the Species of the Year!         Natural Resource Inventories and Long-Term Monitoring Managers are working with the Inventory & Monitoring Program to track long term trends in the park's natural resources. Scientists are monitoring a suite of ecological indicators which will tell them about ecosystem health and changes.         Climate Change \"Earth's climate is changing, with global temperature now rising at a rate unprecedented in the experience of modern human society.\" -Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, 2004         Keep Wildlife Wild As more people visit the park, there is greater potential for negative interactions with wildlife such as coyotes and raccoons.
