Strong currents, sharp drop-offs, and constantly changing river conditions make many areas unsafe for swimming.    Wearing a properly fitting life jacket is strongly recommended when swimming. Never swim alone. Never try to swim across the river. Currents are deceiving;many people have drowned attempting to swim from one side of the river to the other. Apply sunscreen often to avoid sunburns.   Swimming Restrictions Swimming is not permitted within 50 feet of a boat launch, a canoe launch, or the top of any waterfall.
