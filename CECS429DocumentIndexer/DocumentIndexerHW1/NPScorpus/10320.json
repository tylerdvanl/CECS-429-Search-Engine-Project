You can bike through this culturally distinct region of Maine and learn about the French-Acadians at three sites along this 91-mile (146 km) route: the Tri-Cultural Museum in Stockholm, the Mus√©e et Centre Culturel du Mont-Carmel in Lille, and the 18th-century Acadian Village just north of Van Buren.   This tour also features two shorter options: a 20-mile (32 km) loop includes the farm country north of Caribou and New Sweden, and an intermediate 33-mile (53 km) loop with a visit to Stockholm before returning to Caribou.
