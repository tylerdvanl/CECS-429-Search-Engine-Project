Full of majestic scenery and bountiful history, Point Reyes lives up to this image and symbol. Point Reyes is truly a spectacular part of America. Although only 100 square miles in size, Point Reyes has vast cultural and natural diversity awaiting your exploration. On September 13, 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed legislation passed by the Congress establishing Point Reyes National Seashore in order \"to save and preserve, for purposes of public recreation, benefit, and inspiration, a portion of the diminishing seashore of the United States that remains undeveloped.\" (Public Law 87-657) While enjoying their experience at Point Reyes National Seashore, visitors rarely consider what operating a national park entails. Some visitors may stop by a Visitor Center for assistance in planning their visit, may attend a ranger-led program, or may encounter a ranger out on patrol or a trail crew maintaining a trail, but many do not see the management and support personnel who are essential to the operation of the park.  In this section, you can find information on much of the \"behind-the-scenes\" operation of Point Reyes National Seashore. The National Park Service turns 100 on August 25, 2016. To us, it's not about cakes and candles--it's about being an organization ready to take on the challenges of our second century. Our blueprint to get there--A Call to Action--outlines the innovative work we want to accomplish. Point Reyes National Seashore is a big part of this effort. Take a look at what we're doing!
