With over 25 miles of hiking trails and 2.4 miles of boardwalk, there are many ways to explore the Congaree Wilderness. The boardwalk loop trail provides access to Weston Lake and other trails that wind through the Congaree floodplain. Ranger and volunteer guided programs are led on Saturdays year-round. Call the park for more information. A marked canoe trail invites you to explore Cedar Creek. Bring your own canoe and personal flotation devices. Canoes and kayaks may be rented in the Columbia, SC area. Before canoeing ask the park staff about current water levels and conditions since low water or flooding is a possibility. Motorized vehicles and water craft are prohibited in the Congaree wilderness.",
