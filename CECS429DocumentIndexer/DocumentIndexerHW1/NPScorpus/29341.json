    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Things To Do             Things To Do      Plan to spend at least one full day for summer river trips. Bring extra clothing, rain gear, sunscreen, a hat, sunglasses with strap, drinking water and snacks (no glass containers). Wear old sneakers or river shoes to protect your feet. Be sure your life jacket is properly fitted and wear it while on the river. Children 12 years and under are required by law to wear life jackets at all times. Remember that most land along the Upper Delaware River is privately owned. Please respect rights of property owners.  When the Delaware River reaches 6 feet and above at the Barryville or Callicoon gauges, life jackets are required to be worn by all persons including: boaters, swimmers, and wading fisherman.  This is a new regulation mandated by Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River's Superintendant's Compendium of 2010.  River height information can be located by contacting the river hotline at (845) 252-7100. Plan to spend about 1 hour at the Zane Grey Museum and at the Roebling Bridge. The museum has all new exhibits and is self-guided. It is recommended that large groups make reservations in advance at (570) 685-4871.",
