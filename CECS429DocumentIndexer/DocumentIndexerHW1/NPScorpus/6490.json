This three-day course is an active, highly participatory study of the geographic, historic and cultural landscapes that shaped the lifestyles of the people of the Northern Plains.  Costs you will incur are lodging and school credit costs.  Meals and materials provided. Based in Stanton and hosted by Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site on June 25-27, we will explore how elements of the past, current events and cultural and physical changes impact and change our sense of place and community and ways of looking at others and their approaches to their environments.  By combining the history, geography, forestry, technology, and art, participants connect to practical teaching and learning activities. This professional development opportunity will demonstrate team teaching, interdisciplinary curriculum development and implementation and the use of art and technology in strategies that engage students in meaningful activites.  Participants will also become familiar with resources, tools, and information available through NDTRC and its members.
