When you visit any of our visitor centers, you may pick up a Junior Ranger Activity booklet and learn more about Fire Island. Participants will earn a special patch. Open All Year  The Fire Island Lighthouse is open all year, weather permitting. There you may peruse two floors of interactive and two-dimensional exhibits about the maritime history of Fire Island. Guided lighthouse tower tours are also available.  The Wilderness Visitor Center is also accessible year-round by car or bus, with parking available at Smith Point County Park. Here you may explore the only federally designated wilderness area in New York State. Open Seasonally  Fire Island National Seashore's visitor centers at Watch Hill and Sailors Haven are open seasonally, and provide an opportunity to learn about the island's natural and cultural history. The William Floyd Estate is not open as many days or hours as the other sites, but the 1-hour guided tour through the Manor House is worth making the extra effort to catch during your visit.",
