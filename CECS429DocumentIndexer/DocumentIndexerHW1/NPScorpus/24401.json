Denali is one of the many parks that hires a teacher-ranger-teacher to assist our education team during the summer and bring the park back to their classroom in the fall. Denali looks for enthusiastic teachers to complement our vibrant education and interpretation staff. Denali's TRT typically co-develops one major education project with the Parks education specialist. Past projects included developing Denali's distance learning programs, curricula for Denali Science School, summer science education programs, and curricula for Denali's park outreach education program. Candidates with graphic design and informal environmental education skills are preferred. The TRT is supervised by Denali's Education Team and is stationed at the Murie Science and Learning Center near the park entrance. How to Apply:  We accept applications at any point throughout the year. Any K-12 teacher can apply for a Teacher –Ranger –Teacher position. Please email us a cover letter, resume and references.       Ranger by summer, teacher by fall, winter and spring - Paula (far right) engages youth in Denali. NPS Photo \/ Nathan Kostegian",
