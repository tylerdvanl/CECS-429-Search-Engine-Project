    "body": "Planning         Nauset Bike Trail, Eastham NPS  In 1961 the U.S. Congress established Cape Cod National Seashore as a unit of the national park system. Congress recognized that the Outer Beach of the Cape Cod peninsula was nationally significant for ecological, historical, and cultural reasons. The variety of Cape Cod's resources, and the many ways in which people experience these resources, are the key to its charm. But protecting the resources and at the same time providing for their continued use present significant challenges for all residents and land managers on the Cape. The National Park Service prepares a variety of planning and environmental documents to help guide management of park resources. These documents also provide the opportunity for the public and other agencies to engage in the management and planning issues that face the seashore today.
