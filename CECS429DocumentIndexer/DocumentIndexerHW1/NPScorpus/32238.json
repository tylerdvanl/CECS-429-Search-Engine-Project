    "body": "Doan Creek Restoration Time-Line        Early 1990s, the Park Service decided that Doan Creek should be managed as a stream as well as an irrigation channel. 1999, the park holds a series of public meetings regarding long-range planning for the Mission. 2000, a General Management Plan for the park is completed, containing a goal to restore Doan Creek to its original state. 2004, the funding proposal for Doan Creek is approved. 2005, Whitman Mission begins restoration of the original Doan Creek channel. 2006 & 2007, the banks of the restored creek are covered by black mulch cloth to keep invasive species, such as reed canary grass, from taking over and dominating the area. 2007, park staff and volunteers plant native trees and shrubs along the creek.
