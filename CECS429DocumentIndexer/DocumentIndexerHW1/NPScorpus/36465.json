Spring is typically warm and pleasant and is the parks busiest season. Try to avoid mid-march (spring break) unless you have reservations for accommodations.  Summers are hot; although temperatures vary greatly between the desert floor, often above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and the Chisos Mountains, ten to twenty degrees cooler. June-August are the hottest months. Visitors should be familiar with heat safety. The rainy season extends May through September with local heavy thunderstorms and some flash flooding. However, the water recedes rapidly and the rainy season can be a delightful time to visit since afternoon and evening rains often cool the desert.  Fall quickly melds into winter which is pleasantly mild and usually sunny, although periods of cloudy weather and freezing cold do occur. Snow is rare and generally light.  Winter visitors must prepare for a variety of conditions. The holidays (Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks) are typically busy so make reservations for accommodations. Elevation is Everything Air temperature changes by five degrees for every 1,000 feet of elevation you gain or lose; temperatures in the high Chisos Mountains can be 20+ degrees cooler than temperatures along the Rio Grande. Prepare for this kind of variation during your trip. Dress for the Weather Year-round, a wide-brimmed hat, comfortable clothing, and sturdy walking shoes or boots are necessary for anyone planning to get outdoors. Sunscreen is always a must and hikers must always carry plenty of water;one gallon per person per day is recommended. Summer visitors should be aware of heat safety; like wearing clothing that protects from the sun and avoiding activity midday. Winter visitors should be prepared for anything; temperatures vary from below freezing to above 80 degrees Fahrenheit.      Average Temperatures and Precipitation The table below is based on average temperatures and precipitation at Park Headquarters in Panther Junction.
