Birds such as Steller's Jays, Canyon Towhees, and Mountain Chickadees stay year-round whereas Turkey Vultures, Western Tanagers, and Black-headed Grosbeaks are \"summer only\" residents. Sandhill Cranes rarely land in the park but make their presence known each fall and spring as they migrate overhead. If you are looking for a specific bird, it is important to know the habitat it likes. Some birds are common only in the park's lush riparian areas while others prefer the drier mesatops.         Spotted Towhees can be seen in Frijoles Canyon but are more likely to be found on the open scrubby mesatops.
