    "body": "Lincoln Memorial Construction       The Lincoln Memorial construction took place between 1914 and 1922.  Work crews had completed most of the memorial architectural elements by April 1917 when the United States entered into the First World War, but work slowed as a result.  Steady progress nonetheless was maintained on the interior decorations, granite terrace, approach plaza, and grounds landscaping.   From the chamber of the memorial, one can appreciate the different stones used in its construction.  The terrace walls and lower steps comprise granite blocks from Massachusetts - the upper steps, outside façade, and columns contain marble blocks from Colorado - the interior walls and columns are Indiana limestone - the floor is pink Tennessee marble - the ceiling tiles are Alabama marble – and the Lincoln statue comprises 28 pieces of Georgia marble.  These building materials may seem random, but Henry Bacon specifically chose each one to tell a very specific story.  A country torn apart by war can come together, not only to build something beautiful, but also explain the reunification of the states. With the completion of the Lincoln Memorial in 1922, the east\/west vista of the National Mall nearly was complete.  The Reflecting Pool would be finished shortly thereafter and the visual connection between the Father of the Country and the Savior of the Country would be fulfilled.",
