One of the most popular ideas the United States ever produced, the concept of national parks stemmed from the desire to protect special places for now and future generations. Since the first park was designated in the 19th century, the concept has expanded significantly. From its original focus on natural wonders, the idea of a national park has evolved to include sites that chronicle human history and elevate the quality of life. The National Park Service (NPS) is a bureau within the Department of Interior. Currently, there are over 400 park units covering over 84 million acres. The agency employs over 20,000 permanent, temporary and seasonal professionals.",
