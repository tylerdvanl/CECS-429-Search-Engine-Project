It allways appeard a most iniquitious Scheme to me-fight ourselfs for what we are daily robbing and plundering from those who have as good a right to freedom as we have. You know my mind upon this Subject.  Abigail Adams, letter to John Adams, 22 September 1774            John Adams 1735 - 1826   Posterity! You will never know, how much it cost the present generation, to preserve your Freedom! I hope you make good Use of it! If you do not, I shall repent in Heaven, that I ever took half the Pains to preserve it. John Adams, letter to Abigail, 26 April 1777            John Quincy Adams  1767 –1848   During the whole course of my political life I have held myself bound in allegiance to no political party, but to my Country, my whole Country, and nothing but my Country – John Quincy Adams to Russell Freeman, 12 October 1835           Louisa Catherine Adams 1775 - 1852 Went out to Quincy –Weather so severely Cold could not endure it, and was very ill all the time I staid –Quincy! What shall I say of my impressions of Quincy! Had I steped into Noah's Ark I do not think I could have been more utterly astonished – Dr. Tufts! Deacon French! Mr. Cranch, Old Uncle Peter! and Capt Beale!!! Louisa Catherine Adams, Adventures of a Nobody, 1 January 1           Charles Francis Adams 1806 - 1886 I have the misfortune of being the descendant of two great men and must do something to avoid the charge of utter degeneracy. Diary of Charles Francis Adams, 3 October 1835           Henry Adams 1838 - 1918 Man has mounted science, and is now run away with. I firmly believe that before many centuries more, science will be the master of men. The engines he will have invented will be beyond his strength to control. Someday science may have the existence of mankind in its power, and the human race commit suicide, by blowing up the world. Not only shall we be able to cruise in space, but I'll be hanged if I see any reason why some future generation shouldn't walk off like a beetle with the world on its back, or give it another rotary motion so that every zone should receive in turn its due portion of heat and light.
