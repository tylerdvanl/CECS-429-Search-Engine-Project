The 2010 Fire Management Plan (FMP) is similar to the 2005 plan (see above) that has guided fire management actions in the national park. Similar actions in the 2010 FMP include increasing the total acres of prescribed fire from about 4,400 acres to about 6,800 acres, with new prescribed fire units in the Crescent and Enderts Beach areas south of Crescent City to restore grasslands and reduce alien invasive plant species; elarging shaded fuel breaks near Orick and Hiouchi; and constructing a new break around the Howland Hills Outdoor School in Del Norte Country.
