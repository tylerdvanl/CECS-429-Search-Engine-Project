    "body": "Education Themes       Information is grouped by subject matter above to help educators see how the Boston Harbor Islands can enhance specific classroom experiences. Follow the theme links above to explore the education themes for the Boston Harbor Islands.  Â    Park Visitor Themes In looking at the history and offerings of the park, integration is a recurring theme -natural history and human history are interconnected; stories related to Euro-Americans and Native Americans are interwoven; current uses of the islands are influenced by their past roles. A holistic approach to the park shows the inter-connectedness of people to each other, people to nature, the past to the present, and works well for building curriculum that is interdisciplinary. To help visitors learn about the bigger picture, the park has developed four themes (in addition to the above education themes): Islands on the Edge; Home in the Harbor; Portal to New England;and Renewal and Reconnection.",
