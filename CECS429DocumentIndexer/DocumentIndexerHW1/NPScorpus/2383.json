These documents can range from site-specific impact analyses on facility locations to broader park-wide plans for future use and management of the park.   The 1995 General Management Plan (GMP) for Grand Canyon National Park guides the management of resources, visitor use, and general development at the park. The primary purpose of the plan is to provide a foundation from which to protect park resources while providing for meaningful visitor experiences. . A secondary purpose is to encourage compatible activities on adjacent lands so as to minimize adverse effects on the park. The park developed a Foundation Statement [760kb pdf] in 2010; this document records our shared understanding of the park's purpose, significance, and resources and values. Additionally, it serves as a foundation for future planning and management. The North Rim Development Plan  was initiated by Grand Canyon National Park management for the purpose of further refining the 1995 General Management Plan (GMP) direction for development on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park. The Colorado River Management Plan (CRMP) is a visitor use management plan that specifies actions to conserve park resources and visitor experience while enhancing river running recreational opportunities on the Colorado River through Grand Canyon National Park.
