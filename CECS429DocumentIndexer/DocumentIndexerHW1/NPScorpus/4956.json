Border crossing by undocumented immigrants and illegal entry of those smuggling contraband into the United States is common. Nevertheless, hikers, cyclists, and birders safely enjoy the park trails daily. Established trails during daylight hours are safe, but it is good to be aware of your surroundings and not travel cross-country.  What Can You Do?   Be Aware, Be Safe Remember that cell phone service is usually out of range within Memorial boundaries Know where you are at all times, follow good safety procedures and use common sense when making decisions Do not pick-up hitch hikers Keep valuables, including spare change, out of sight and lock your vehicle Avoid traveling on well-used but unofficial \"trails\" Avoid hiking in areas of major border activity  People in distress may ask for food, water or other assistance. It is recommended that you do not make contact. Report the location of the distressed people to the visitor center, other park staff, or the Border Patrol Report ANY suspicious behavior to park staff or Border Patrol. Please do not contact suspicious persons, contact a Ranger for assistance",
