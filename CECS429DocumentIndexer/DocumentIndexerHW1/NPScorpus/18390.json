Hot Springs National Park was once known as Hot Springs Reservation. It was set aside in 1832 to protect the Park's primary resource, the hot springs.This type of Reservation was an early version of the National Park idea.Hot Springs was actually the first area in the United States to be set aside for its natural features.After Yellowstone was formed in 1872, Hot Springs was managed with it. In 1916 the National Park Service was formed and in 1921, Hot Springs Reservation changed its name to Hot Springs National Park, making it the 18th National Park in the Service. Hot Springs National Park is best known for the 47 hot springs that come out of the Hot Springs Mountain at an average 143° Fahrenheit. Hot Springs National Park is the only unit of the national park system that is mandated to give away its primary natural resource to the general public in an unending and unaltered state. Drinking the hot springs water is perfectly normal, even encouraged. The water is naturally potable (good to drink) when it arrives at the surface of Hot Springs Mountain. Thousands of visitors highly endorse the good quality of the hot springs water and fill bottles to take home. Unfortunately, we do not have any thermal water spring \"in nature\" where you can get into. Since our water is 143° (F) and is too hot to submerge your body in, there are two operating bathhouses on the Row where you can fully experience the water and drinking fountains have been built so people can enjoy the water that has given the park and the city its name.",
