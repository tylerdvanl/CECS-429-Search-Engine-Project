Charles Young overcame countless amounts of stifling obstacles throughout his life to earn the respect of his racial counterparts and peers. In doing so, he paved the way for future generations of African-Americans who would follow in his footsteps.   The African-American soldiers that made up the famed \"Buffalo Soldiers\" would serve in countless U.S. conflicts throughout their 80 year plus span as segregated regiments. Fighting for a country that marginalized who they were based on the color of their skin, these men would valiantly fight on for the honor, the respect and the dignity they deserved, on and off of the battlefield.
