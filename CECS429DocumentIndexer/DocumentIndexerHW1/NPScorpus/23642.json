You must look closely to see them - they are well camouflaged in their environment.        An Ambush Bug's front legs are adapted into curved claws for capturing their prey. Photo by Sally King  The front legs of an Ambush bug are well-adapted for capturing and holding their prey. With these hooked claws, an Ambush Bug can capture and consume prey much larger than itself.       You are most likely to see an Ambush Bug if you look closely at a flower where the bug is waiting patiently for an unsuspecting pollinator.
