The visitor is left with the distinct feeling that the Trumans have just stepped out. Thus, preservation of this historic scene is a fundamental mandate for park management. Preservation of the historic landscape, however, is at times a difficult task. It is impossible for natural elements to be \"frozen in time.\" A Cultural Landscape Report has been created and remains a vital preservation tool. The Truman property, with its somewhat dense and overgrown shrubbery, accurately reflects the Trumans' desire for privacy as well as their Midwestern thrift and taste. It is far from a well-manicured showplace. The landscaping is little different from that of other yards in the neighborhood.       The Truman landscape offers a variety of planting representative of the region and family tastes.
