    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Things To Do             Things To Do          Whether you have an hour, a day, or a week, you can plan a great visit to Shenandoah National Park. Even if you are just passing through the region, use Skyline Drive for a portion of your route. Traveling from one of the four entrances to the next exit takes about an hour. Along the way you will see the beautiful vistas Shenandoah is known for. If you can spend the day, check the Ranger Programs schedule for a hike, walk, or talk that interests you. Stop by a Visitor Center to get hiking suggestions, and see the exhibits and movies. Or go birdwatching, wander in Big Meadows, or try an earthcache. A week (or more!) in Shenandoah will fly by with hiking, evening programs at the campgrounds, entertainment at the lodges, visits to our cultural sites and exhibits, and excursions to nearby attractions.",
