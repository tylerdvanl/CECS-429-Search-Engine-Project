In addition to the existing metro subway and bus routes near the park, visitors may use interpretive bus tours provided through a park concessioner. The park is working with a multi-entity working group to establish Circulator bus services to the park in 2015. The park is also working with George Mason University on a study to improve tour bus operations. The park has permitted pedicabs to operate on park roads, and segways on park paths. Bicycle racks are distributed throughout the park, particularly close to highly visited memorials. In a partnership with the District Department of Transportation, five Capital Bikeshare stations were installed in 2012 near the Lincoln Memorial, Smithsonian Metro, Martin Luther King\/Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorials, Jefferson Memorial, and Washington Monument. The stations are now some of the highest used stations in the 150+ station system. See http:\/\/www.capitalbikeshare.com\/stations for a station map.  Â       Capital Bikeshare stations are located throughout the park.",
