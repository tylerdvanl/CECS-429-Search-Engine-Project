Â    A variety of animals make the Obed and the surrounding areas their home throughout much of the year. Many of the animals can be spotted quite easily, while others are more difficult to view. Some of the animals are nocturnal, coming out only at night to hunt for food. The animals range in sizes from small fish like the bluegill to larger, fur-bearing animals like the whitetail deer.
