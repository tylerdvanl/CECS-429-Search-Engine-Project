    "body": "Industrial Calumet        Calumet & Hecla Mining Operations from Swedetown Hill circa 1900(object placeholder)  Â    The Calumet and Hecla (C&H) Mining Company grew from humble beginnings into the largest and most successful copper mining company in the Lake Superior region. C&H's success and fortune was due mainly to it's location on the copper-rich Calumet Conglomerate Lode. C&H's mine shafts and surface operations were constructed to effectively extract the copper-bearing ore.   Though quiet today, numerous structures remain in this former industrial landscape that allow visitors to connect with the stories of the people who once worked here. The former C&H General Office Building now serves as the Keweenaw National Historical Park Headquarters. The National Park Service also owns the former C&H Public Library and the former C&H Warehouse Number 1.",
