NPS  The Cuyahoga River Valley Twenty-two miles of the Cuyahoga River wind and weave through the Cuyahoga Valley, forming the backbone of Cuyahoga Valley National Park (CVNP). The river, with its associated riparian habitat, is just one element of the park’s habitat mosaic. From deciduous mixed-mesophytic forests to wetland habitats, from currently cultivated agricultural lands to older field habitats in various stages of succession, the park’s habitats provide opportunities for plants and animals to flourish. Over 900 plant species are found in the park, as well as 194 species of birds, 91 aquatic macroinvertebrates, 43 fish, 32 mammals, 22 amphibians, and 20 species of reptiles. Read about how our scientists inventory and monitor (I&M) species to build a strong scientific foundation for the management and protection of natural resources in the park. CVNP is much more than a list of species. It contains a truly unique physical environment, formed by the mingling of two diverse geographic regions—the Appalachian Plateau and the Central Lowlands—modified by the comings and goings of multiple glaciations. High above the Cuyahoga River, the landscape is rugged, with steep-sided valleys backed by high, narrow hills. Closely spaced ravines funnel tributaries, some of which drop up to 600 feet in a distance of only a few miles, toward the crooked river. Read more about CVNP's geology in our Rock, Ice, and River site bulletin. (720 KB) NPS Science and Research Websites to Explore The Heartland Inventory and Monitoring Network (HTLN) is part of the nationwide Inventory & Monitoring (I&M) program of the National Park Service (NPS). Park Science is a National Park Service publication reporting on scientific research and its implications for management at the parks. The Climate Change Response Program (CCRP) fosters communication and provides guidance, scientific information, and recommendations that support stewardship actions to preserve our natural and cultural heritage from the detrimental impacts of global climate change.
