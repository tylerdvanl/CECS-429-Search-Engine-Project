The NPS is asking for feedback from working groups, made up of interested stakeholders and citizens, to develop a long-term and sustainable winter use Adaptive Management Plan (AMP), which will guide the park's future data collection on the impacts of winter use. Working groups are sub-groups of the larger adaptive management team, which meets to discuss ideas across topics and provide feedback on the overall AMP process.

Each working group will develop a monitoring strategy for its impact topic in coordination with a National Park Service subject-matter expert. Specifically, working groups are tasked with providing feedback on what resource or impact questions should be monitored to address key scientific uncertainties about their impact topic, and on how to design a fiscally sustainable, efficient and feasible monitoring strategy to achieve key monitoring objectives going forward. Park managers will then use the results of winter use monitoring and stakeholder input to make decisions that best protect park resources and the visitor experience.
