While they have the opportunity to become a Junior Ranger at every National Park, the St. Croix National Scenic Riverway's Junior Ranger program is particularly prestigious. It is only for the bravest, cleverest, most resilient and environmentally minded youth of America! If you're up for the challenge you must complete 10 activities from the St. Croix Junior Ranger Booklet (which can be downloaded or picked up at one of the St. Croix Visitor Centers). You must then present your work to a National Park Ranger for inspection and finally demonstrate your ability to select and put on an appropriate personal floatation device at one the visitor centers. If successful you be sworn in as an official St. Croix Scenic Riverway Junior Ranger during an official ceremony in which you will take the Junior Ranger Pledge and receive the Junior Ranger Badge and Certificate as a symbol of achievement. If you complete all of the Junior Ranger Activities in the activity book you will also earn the Official St. Croix National Scenic Riverway Junior Ranger PATCH! Other interactive activities and opportunities to learn more are available at visitor centers. The rivers provide lots of things to see and areas to explore. A handout is available to help you seek wildlife.  Keep your eyes wide open.  If you're unable to visit the Park or if you're searching for still more National Park Service FUN, become a WebRanger online! Through this site you can create an official WebRanger ID card, customize your own digital ranger station and play fun interactive WebRanger games.",
