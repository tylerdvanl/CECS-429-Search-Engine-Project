In fact, 172 species have been observed during surveys of park land. Grassland birds such as Henslow’s sparrow, dickcissels, and eastern meadowlarks may be seen and\/or heard. When wandering in upland areas, look up and listen for red-bellied woodpeckers, black and white warblers, and red-eyed vireos. Splashes of color can be seen throughout the year as indigo buntings, American goldfinches, and northern cardinals fly by. Occasionally a lucky park visitor may observe the Federally-listed bald eagle soaring overhead. Birds may be seen during all the seasons, whether transitory migrants or local inhabitants. Mound City Group and High Bank Works contain land designated as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by the Ohio Audobon Society. Sites designated as IBA are considered significant due to the presence of essential habitat and large numbers of bird species that utilize the area. The Scioto Valley Bird and Nature Club, an active group of birders and nature lovers, regularly conducts bird walks on park grounds. In addition, they have been collecting information since 1988 and have compiled a bird checklist available at the Visitor Center. More information is available on the Club's facebook page or attend their monthly meeting on the fourth Monday of every month at 7 pm at the Mound City Group visitor center.      View the Birds Species List for the park.      View the 2012 Bird Monitoring Status Report for the park.      Download the Hopewell Culture NHP bird checklist to take along during a hike at any of our park units.",
