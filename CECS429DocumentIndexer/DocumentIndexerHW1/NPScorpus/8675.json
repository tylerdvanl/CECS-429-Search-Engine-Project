    "body": "A Wondrous Diversity of Life  Ridge upon ridge of forest straddles the border between North Carolina and Tennessee in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. World renowned for its diversity of plant and animal life, the beauty of its ancient mountains, and the quality of its remnants of Southern Appalachian mountain culture, this is America's most visited national park.                Black Bears   Bears in the park are wild and their behavior can be unpredictable. Treat bear encounters with extreme caution!         Cades Cove   Wildlife viewing, historic homes and churches, and beautiful mountain scenery make Cades Cove the most popular destination in the park.              Wildflowers   From the earliest hepaticas in late winter to the last asters in late fall, blooming flowers can be found nearly year-round in the park.        Things To Do   Feel the cool spray of a waterfall. Camp under the stars. Explore a historic mill. There's plenty to see and do in the park!",
