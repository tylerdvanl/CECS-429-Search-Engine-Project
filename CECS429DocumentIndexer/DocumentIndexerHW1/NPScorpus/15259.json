    "body": "Buffalo Eddy         Petrogylph of what could perhaps be a sheep at Buffalo Eddy, Washington. National Park Service  Across North America, Native Americans have left their etchings and paintings on rocks. The Nez Perce are no different. Long before Europeans or Americans first set foot in this country, the Nez Perce left behind vivid evidence of their association with this land. On either side of an eddy formed by a series of sharp bends in the Snake River are densely grouped clusters of petroglyphs and a few pictographs. Known as Buffalo Eddy, the unique petroglyphs of this area are evidence of the longevity of the Nez Perce in the region and contain hundreds of distinct images that possibly date from as early as 4,500 years ago. Petroglyphs are designs or figures, pecked, abraded or chipped into a rock surface. Pictographs are designs or figures painted onto a rock surface. Native Americans across North America have created various forms of rock art for thousands of years. The meanings of rock art are not known.Perhaps the figures and symbols are a form of storytelling or an expression of spirituality. They could even be a form of artistic expression. We do not know for sure. Every person who sees these images takes away their own meanings. If you would like some more information for a visit, we have a guide to the site.
