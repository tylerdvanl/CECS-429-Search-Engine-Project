The program also includes some day trips to different historic sites impacted by the War of 1812. One of our goals of the workshop is to show educators how they can tie this topic into the current core standards that already exist at the high school, middle school and elementary levels. At the completion of the teacher workshop teachers will be able to sign-up to participate in the international educational program where students from the United States and Belgium would produce video's, apps and other materials based on their interpretation of the War of 1812 as it impacted not only their countries but also the communities that they live in. The classes would then meet to exchange video presentations and have a discussion about the war via teleconferencing, Skype or some other media.  In some cases students will be able debate about the war and the impacts that still linger in today's society.    Please view the registration form and introductory letter for more details and registration information.",
