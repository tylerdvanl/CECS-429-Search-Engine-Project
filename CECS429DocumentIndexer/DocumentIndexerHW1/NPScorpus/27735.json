    "body": "Pets         Map of facilities at Mount Rushmore National Memorial.   We realize that many of our visitors enjoy traveling with their pets. However, because of the large numbers of people who visit each day we also have concerns for the comfort and safety of all our visitors, pets and wildlife. To balance these needs, pets on a leash (no longer than six feet) are permitted only in the parking garages and the areas adjacent to them. These areas are shaded orange on the park facilities map, and include:  the pet exercise areas located at each end of the upper level of the parking facility at the entrance to the main visitor area, by the benches at the main pergola (the row of large columns at the walk-in entrance)  To help keep Mount Rushmore clean for those who visit after you, please pick up after your pet with bags that are provided in the pet exercise areas.  While kennel services are not available at Mount Rushmore, they are available in nearby communities.  Service dogs, as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act requirements, are permitted to accompany visitors with disabilities in all areas open to the public at Mount Rushmore National Memorial.
