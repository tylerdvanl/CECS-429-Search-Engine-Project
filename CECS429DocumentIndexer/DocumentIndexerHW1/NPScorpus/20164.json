A trip to the fort however, is not a trip strictly for adults. Children of all ages can interact with the park with a hand on approach. They can explore the ramparts, the dark casemates, or discover miles of nature trails. Children can have a unique and fresh perspective when they visit. To help forge a special relationship with the fort, we offer three programs that can help immerse a child into the Fort Pulaski experience:   Junior Ranger Program   Junior Civil War Historian Program   Civil War Trading Card Program",
