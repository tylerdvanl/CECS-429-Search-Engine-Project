Take the Mamalahoa Trail and imagine what it would be like to lead your donkeys laden with produce on your way to the market.  Take a portion of the Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail past heiau and house platforms that remain from long ago. The more recent Ala Hele Ike Trail will lead you from the visitor center to Honokohau Beach, passing native plants and stone walls and a corral that remains from the ranching days of the past as you hike along the trail.",
