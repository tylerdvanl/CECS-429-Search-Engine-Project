In addition to exploring the history of copper mining, numerous recreational opportunities are available in the area. In the summer hiking, canoeing, kayaking fishing, camping and biking are popular activities. During the winter, the normally abundant snowfall make this a prime area for snowshoeing, cross-country and downhill skiing, ice fishing and snowmobiling. For information on area attractions and activities visit the Keweenaw Convention & Visitors Bureau website.  The Calumet Visitor Center The Calumet Visitor Center is located at 98 5th Street in downtown Calumet.  Visitors can explore 3 floors of interactive exhibits, films and museum pieces focusing not only on mining history, but the social aspect as well.  The Visitor Center is fully accessible and free of charge.  Please note that the Visitor Center will be open as staffing allows. You may call (906) 337-3168 for the most current information.  Information Desk at Quincy Mine During the summer season, Keweenaw NHP operates an information desk in the Quincy Mine Gift Shop.  Here visitors can obtain information about the tours, local history or the general area.  The copper timeline is featured in this area.  Please note that staffing can be intermittent. Visitors are free to explore the expansive grounds of the Quincy Mine, though underground mine tours are part of the paid admission through the Quincy Mine & Hoist.    During the summer, National Park Service staff provide guided interpretive programs in both the Calumet and Quincy Units. Check the current edition of the park newspaper for programs, locations and times.  The park's partners, known as Keweenaw Heritage Sites, offer a wide range of activities including museums, mine tours, theatrical performances or hiking and camping. The heritage sites are a collection of public and private entities. They are independently operated and should be contacted directly for information and schedules.   Please respect private property during your visit to the Keeweenaw.  Take only pictures and leave only footprints.       Visitors explore museum pieces and interactive exhibits at the Calumet Visitor Center. NPS Photo",
