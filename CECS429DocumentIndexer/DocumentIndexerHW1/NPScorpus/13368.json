    "body": "Camping Without a Reservation       If you don't have a campground reservation, you can try to camp in a first-come, first-served campground. These can fill up early from spring through fall and during holidays in winter. Check current campground status by calling 209\/372-0266. Campground opening and closing dates are updated whenever we have new information.  Within Yosemite National Park, you may not sleep in your car or RV except in a campsite that you're registered to stay in (except at Camp 4, where sleeping in cars is not allowed because it's a walk-in campground). Sleeping in your car along the side of the road is also not allowed.   April through June  Very few first-come, first-served campsites are available in May and June!   Some first-come, first-served campgrounds may open in June if conditions allow. Check the campground page for the most up-to-date opening and closing dates. Camp 4 (a walk-in campground) is open all year, but is extremely popular; it's very difficult to get a spot. Also, it's worth searching recreation.gov frequently; you might find a cancellation in a campground that accepts reservations in or near Yosemite.   July through September In order to have a reasonable chance of finding a campsite, you should arrive at the campground of your choice by mid-morning (Camp 4 may fill earlier). Also, it's worth searching recreation.gov frequently; you might find a cancellation in a campground that accepts reservations in or near Yosemite. The following campgrounds operate on a first-come, first-served basis during this time:   Camp 4 (Yosemite Valley) (no RVs\/trailers) Bridalveil Creek (RVs up to 35 feet\/trailers up to 24 feet) Tamarack Flat (not recommended for RVs\/trailers) White Wolf (RVs up to 27 feet\/trailers up to 24 feet) Yosemite Creek (not recommended for RVs\/trailers) Porcupine Flat (not recommended for RVs\/trailers) Tuolumne Meadows (RVs and trailers up to 35 feet; 50% of sites are available on a first-come, first-served basis)    October through March From fall through early spring, you may be able to find a campsite at one of the reservation campgrounds or at Wawona and Hodgdon Meadow Campgrounds, which operate on a first-come, first-served basis from approximately October through April. Camp 4 (a walk-in campground) is open all year, but is extremely popular; it's very difficult to get a spot. During October, it's worth searching recreation.gov frequently; you might find a cancellation in a campground that accepts reservations in or near Yosemite.   The following campgrounds operate on a first-come, first-served basis during this time:  Camp 4 (Yosemite Valley) (no RVs\/trailers) Tamarack Flat (not recommended for RVs\/trailers; closes by October 15) Porcupine Flat (limited space for RVs up to 24 feet\/trailers up to 20 feet; closes by October 15)    How to Register for a First-Come, First-Served Campground  Camp 4 and Tuolumne Meadows  Camp 4 is staffed from spring to fall. Tuolumne Meadows is staffed the entire season it's open (approximately July through September). To register at these staffed campgrounds, go to the campground. At Camp 4, go to the kiosk in the campground; at Tuolumne Meadows, go to the campground reservation office along the Tioga Road, just outside the campground. You may register for multiple nights (up to the annual and seasonal camping limits).  All Other First-come, First-Served Campgrounds  Go to the campground of your choice. If space is available, claim a campsite. Walk back to the registration area near the entrance to the campground to fill out the self-registration envelope. You may register for multiple nights (up to the annual and seasonal camping limits).",
