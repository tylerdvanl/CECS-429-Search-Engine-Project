    "body": "Be A Junior Ranger       Junior Ranger Program Children 5 and up are invited to participate in the Junior Ranger Program. The program is an exciting experience for those wishing to explore the park.  There are two booklets, one for ages 5-7, and the second for ages 8-12. Kids and parents can pick up booklets at the Visitor Center.  Most Junior Rangers complete the booklet in one to two hours, but may take as much time as they wish to finish. Children who complete the booklet earn a Junior Ranger Badge to honor their accomplishments. The Junior Ranger booklets are available to download here. Ages 5-7 (.pdf file) Ages 8-12 (.pdf file)    Want to explore more of your National Parks? Many National Parks offer Junior Ranger programs both in the park and on the Internet.
