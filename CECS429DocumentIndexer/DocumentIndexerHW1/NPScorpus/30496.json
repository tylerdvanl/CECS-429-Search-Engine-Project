    "body": "EarthCaching         Ice Box Cave Interior ©JACK RIGBY  Thanks to our enthusiastic volunteers, Cuyahoga Valley National Park now offers a fun new way to use your portable Global Positioning System (GPS).  EarthCaching™ is an offshoot of geocaching that involves treasure hunting for caches that the Earth has created rather than containers hidden by humans. These self-guided hikes focus on interesting geological features.    We currently have EarthCaches™ for Blue Hen Falls, Brandywine Falls, Ice Box Cave, Lock 29 to Deep Lock Towpath Trail, along the Old Carriage Trail, Riding Run Trail, and on the Towpath Trail from Lock 29 to Deep Lock. Follow the clues and complete the activities listed online to get credit for your find. To learn more, visit www.earthcache.org and search for Ohio sites. If you are interested in creating a new CVNP EarthCache™, contact Arrye Rosser at (440) 546-5992 or e-mail us about becoming an EarthCache™ volunteer. Note that the national park does not permit geocaches at this time.",
