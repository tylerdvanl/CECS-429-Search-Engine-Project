    "body": "Park Families       Though Prince William Forest Park was founded largely as a natural area to be used for recreation, the preservation of this forest has protected the history of this land as well. What could have turned to shopping malls and housing developments, now lies safely protected forever beneath the trees.   Over 45 family cemeteries exist within the park. At least 300 individual burials have been identified. The location of these sites will not be revealed to anyone but family descendants, but the stories of these remarkable people deserve to be celebrated. If you do come across a family cemetery in Prince William Forest Park, please respect these sites and do not attempt to move or remove any artifacts. It is illegal to remove or alter any artifacts or historic sites within a National Park and violators will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.  If you are a member of a park family, please contact the visitor center at 703-221-7181 or via email to plan a visit, request an additional burial or share information about your family history.           Oral Histories of Farm Families Listen to oral histories about the families who lived here before the park was created.         Taylor, Robert and Jennie         Carter, Major Henry Everett         The Florence Family",
