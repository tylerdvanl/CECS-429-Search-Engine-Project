    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility             Accessibility       In each area of the park, sections of trail are wheelchair accessible and other sections are not. As boardwalk is replaced, we build it to standards for universal accessibility. It is best to call the specific site you plan to visit for particulars.   We have available at Sailors Haven a special wheelchair, which enables beach travel. The wheelchair is loaned to visitors on a first come, first served basis.    At the William Floyd Estate and the Fire Island Lighthouse, only the first floor is accessible to wheelchairs. At both these sites, exhibits are concentrated on the first floors. At the William Floyd Estate, a photograph album depicts the rooms on the second floor for those unable to reach it physically. At the Fire Island Lighthouse Keepers' Quarters, a filmed version of the Lighthouse tower tour is available to view.   With advance notice, individualized programs may be arranged for groups or individuals with special educational needs or mental challenges. Call park headquarters for information and scheduling.",
