    "body": "Queen Snake          Regina septemvittata The Maryland Department of Natural Resources lists the Queen Snake as an uncommon snake species of Maryland. Although, the Queen Snake is not endangered on the federal level, many states have listed them as endangered.. Queen snakes have quite specific habitat requirements. They require clear spring-fed streams with moderate to fast currents and rocky bottoms. Queen snakes are rarely found far from their water habitat. One of the reasons is that their main food source, freshly molted crayfish, live in these waters under the rocks. If you are hiking in the park and spot a queen snake, please call 301-839-1176 or 202-690-5160 to report your findings.",
