Photo Â© Hank and Marsha Rhodes  Evening bats (Nycticeius humeralis) range throughout the Midwestern and Eastern United States and are common throughout Florida, though none have been reported in the Florida Keys. Evening bats are known to roost in palm fronds in Florida.  Females are larger than males. The wingspan of adult evening bats measures about 10 or 11 inches, and body length measures about 1.9 to 2.6 inches. Adult weight ranges from about 0.2 to 0.4 ounces (7 to 14 grams). The fur of evening bats is typically dark brown but may be tinted bronze or red.  Evening bats are insectivorous and prefer to feed to beetles, but they will also eat moths, flies, and other insects. They typically forage for food along the edges of forests, in clearings, and over waterways. Females typically give birth to two pups in late April or May. The pups are capable of flight within 20 days, are nearly adult size at 1 month, and are completely weaned within 6 to 9 weeks. Young males leave the maternity roost as soon as they are weaned, but females continue to forage with their mothers.",
