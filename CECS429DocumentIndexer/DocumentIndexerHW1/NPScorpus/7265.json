The range of this cottontail just reaches the southern edge of the Northern Rockies.  Its habitat is the open, arid sagebrush areas common throughout the recreation area. In size, they are generally small with dark ears and short legs.  These rabbits take over vacant burrows or make shelters in brush heaps.  Litters average about four or five completely helpless babies, which will be ready to leave the mother in about two months.",
