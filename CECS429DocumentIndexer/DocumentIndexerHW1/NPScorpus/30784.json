    "body": "Archeology         Archeologists excavate during the 1970s excavations. NPS photo  Nearly 50 years ago archeologists began to locate the remains of the original Fort Stanwix (briefly renamed Fort Schuyler, 1776-1781). Remnants of the original fort were discovered and nearly 500,000 artifacts were found dating to the 18th, 19th, and early 20th century. Archeology continues today at Fort Stanwix National Monument. When maintenance or construction activities take place, archeology is done first in order to ensure that the site is not destroyed and the resources are preserved. These projects are driven by the desire to preserve the archeological resources at the park and meet compliance standards of the federal government.
