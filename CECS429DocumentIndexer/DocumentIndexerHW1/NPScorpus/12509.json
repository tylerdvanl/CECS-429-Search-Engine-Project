Researchers and agency personnel presented current information, including: physical and biological aquatic studies, evolving threats to current ecological systems, and the dynamic climate within the Redwood Creek watershed. Attendees included community members, researchers, agency personnel, NGO staff and other interested parties. Following the presentations, a discussion took place to identify research, management, action, and data needs in relation to drought and climate variability for the watershed. The symposium, funded by the California Department of Conservation and organized by Pacific Coast Fish, Wildlife and Wetlands Restoration Association, was an opportunity to network, collaborate, and share ideas about the past and current conditions, as well as the future of the Redwood Creek watershed with a variety of perspectives. The Redwood Creek Symposium Proceedings (PDF, 1.9 MB) was compiled by Pacific Coast Fish, Wildlife and Wetlands Restoration Association and contains abstracts from each presenter and a summary of the needs discussion.
