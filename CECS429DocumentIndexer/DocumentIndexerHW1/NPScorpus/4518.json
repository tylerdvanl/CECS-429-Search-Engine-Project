Camping Reservations The National Park Service does not take camping reservations for individual campsites. Designated campsites are on a first come first served basis with an overflow area available if needed. We do not turn away any campers when they arrive at Garden Key.

The Ferry has a limited number of campers they can carry daily, so book early.   The seaplane concessionaire will not transport camping gear.",
