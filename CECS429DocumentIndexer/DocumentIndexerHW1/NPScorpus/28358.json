    "body": "A Trash Free Park       Trash cans have been removed from the park to protect and improve the environment. Please take your trash when you leave and dispose of it properly This program is designed to encourage reuse and recycling practices. We all share the responsibility for managing solid waste and the park's environment. Fort Necessity National Battlefield, Friendship Hill National Historic Site, Johnstown Flood National Memorial, and Allegheny Portage Railroad National Historic Site participate in the \"Leave no Trace\" program. The many benefits of this program include removing garbage and recycling containers and associated odors from within the park, reducing annoying pests and unsightly conditions. Eliminating the need for disposal services will also allow the parks an opportunity to make more productive use of available park resources. Click here for Leave no Trace Poster",
