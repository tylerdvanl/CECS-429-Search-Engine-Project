National parks enrich the lives of many in this nation. They provide access to the powerful ideas, values, and meanings associated with the remarkable cultural, natural, and recreational heritage of the United States. The National Park Service (NPS) strives to provide opportunities for all Americans to connect to their national heritage through the national parks. However, these opportunities are lacking for some children- often due to a variety of social and economic factors. The Teacher to Ranger to Teacher (TRT) Program offers a solution, by linking National Park units with teachers from Title I (40% of students on free or reduced cost lunch) schools or school districts. Teacher Rangers Teachers form a link between school children and National Parks. At this time, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area does not have any openings for Teacher Ranger Teachers during the summer of 2014. This page will be updated if any positions become available.",
