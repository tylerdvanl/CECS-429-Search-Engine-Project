Visit Fort Vancouver provides a Junior Ranger program that encourages kids to learn about history and the national park through fun activities. Learn more here. Additionally, Fort Vancouver offers Kids Dig programs every summer. The programs are open to youth ages 8-12. Kids Digs provide youth with firsthand experience in archaeology and history.  The park also features hands on exhibits inside the reconstructed Counting House, at the Fort Vancouver Visitor Center, and at Pearson Air Museum. Also at Pearson Air Museum is an indoor coloring and reading area geared towards young children. An outdoor playground is located near the park's Visitor Center. Volunteer  Two \"hands-on\" immersive Youth Volunteer-In-Parks Programs (Y-VIP) encourage students from ages 9 to 18 to experience life and learning in the 19th century. The two interacting tracks share resources that train youth in providing historic interpretation, demonstrating skills from the past, and speaking to the public. Fort Vancouver NHS has a thriving youth volunteer program, and we would love for you to be a part of it!
