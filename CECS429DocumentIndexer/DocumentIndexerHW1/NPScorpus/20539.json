There are a few things to keep in mind when coming to the park as an artist:  You don't need reservations to paint on-site.  Parking is limited. If you plan on arriving in more than 2 cars, please contact a Park Ranger at 203-834-1896 ext. 12.  You must be able to transport your art supplies on your own. Park Rangers will not be able to assist you. You cannot drive into the historic landscape or pull off on the side of the road to drop off supplies.  There are no facilities to clean art supplies on-site. Public restrooms are not for cleaning art supplies. Painters who clean their palettes\/brushes in these sinks will damage public facilities.  There are no trash facilities on-site. Please take everything you brought to the park home with you.  Photographers must have a permit if they plan to use tripods, stands, lighting, props, or any equipment, or if they are shooting commercially.  Be respectful of others around you. Please remember that everyone is equal: creating your work cannot conflict with other people's use of public areas.  Artists may not sell their works on park grounds or solicit others to purchase artwork.",
