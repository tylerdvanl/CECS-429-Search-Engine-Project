NPS Photo  Are you and your children interested in learning about nature and developing skills to explore the natural world? Wind Cave staff are happy to announce the return of Adventures in Nature starting in January, 2016. Geared for children ages 3 to 12, this free program provides a safe and comfortable environment for children to experience nature and play in an active learning environment. As in recent years, children will be grouped and explore activities according to their age to best meet the needs of such a wide range of ages. Programs begin January 12th and will be offered every other Tuesday through April 5th. Topics vary each week and will always include activities, crafts, and a hike that explores the concept of the day. A full list of topics is provided below. Registration begins at 9:45 a.m. each day, with programs running from 10 a.m. to noon. We suggest that parents provide their children with a snack before we begin the program. If you plan to attend please contact the Visitor Center by phone at 605-745-1134. RSVP-ing is not required but is encouraged to help ensure enough materials for everyone, and help us alert participants in the event of bad weather or travel conditions. Please include the number of children that will be participating and their ages. Older children are also welcome, and may take part in activities or assist younger children in their exploration and activities.
