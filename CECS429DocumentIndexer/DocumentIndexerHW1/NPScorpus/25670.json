    "body": "Sport Hunting and Trapping       Sport hunting and trapping are permitted in Katmai National Preserve, but not in Katmai National Park. To hunt and trap in the preserve, you must have all required licenses and permits and follow all other state regulations. The National Park Service and the State of Alaska cooperatively manage the wildlife resources of the Preserve. An Alaska State hunting license is required for all hunters age 16 or older. Bag and possession limits vary by species and by area. Always check current hunting regulations. For further information on Alaska hunting and where to get a license, visit the Alaska Department of Fish and Game website.  The most common species hunted include moose and brown bear. Please keep in mind that many areas within the preserve are private land. Do not enter private land without the landowner's permission. There are many factors applicable to season dates as well as residency requirements for species such as caribou. Regulations specific to Katmai National Preserve can be found under Game Management Unit (GMU)-9.   Hunting and trapping within Katmai National Preserve requires extensive planning. Access in most cases will involve air taxi service via float plane from King Salmon or one of the other surrounding villages. We highly recommend you to contact any of the several permitted commercial operators who provide taxi and hunt transport services throughout the local area. A list of these providers can be found in the directory of commercial visitor services.   Take the time to understand land ownership prior to hunting as there are some private land parcels within the preserve boundary. We also recommend sharing your camp and hunt plans with the Park office as part of your trip safety plan",
