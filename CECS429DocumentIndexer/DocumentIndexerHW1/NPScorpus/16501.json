Kira Cassidy, research associate with the Yellowstone Wolf Project, provides context and insight as a wolf tests an elk along Soda Butte Creek.            The Restoration of Grayling Creek To maintain the natural biodiversity of the Yellowstone ecosystem, sometimes you have to start small. Fish biologist Todd Koel discusses efforts to restore native fish in Grayling Creek, a cup of eggs at a time.          Bear Jams What should you do in a bear jam? Bear Management Biologist Kerry Gunther and Park Ranger John Kerr describe some best practices for handling these potentially dangerous situations.            Baby's First Steps Bison Ecologist Rick Wallen discusses some of the challenges faced by bison calves immediately after their birth.            Grand Geyser Located in the Upper Geyser Basin not far from Old Faithful, Grand Geyser erupts with powerful bursts that shoot 150 to 200 feet in the air, making it the tallest predictable geyser in the world.              Fountain Geyser You know you're living right when a visit to the Lower Geyser Basin coincides with an eruption of Fountain Geyser. Watch closely and you'll see flashes of bright blue as steam bubbles explode and propel water from the crater.            Boardwalk Bear One of the thrills of visiting Yellowstone is that you never know when you'll see a bear: which means you should always be ready for it.            Siesta As the rut winds down in October, the Mammoth elk herd spends more and more time lounging in the shade of employee houses along Officer's Row. This leads to many surprises when you open your door in the morning, and to some uncommonly close filming from the safety of a house.            Bull Fight As night falls on Mammoth Hot Springs, elk bugles ring out in every direction. Three or four bulls trot past the glowing windows of Officer's Row, converging near the southern end of Fort Yellowstone. Suddenly two begin a fight for dominance and access to females, the entire display lit by cars making a late exit from the park.            September Sunrise As the autumn sun rises on the West Thumb Geyser Basin, the air swirls with steam and the signature sounds of bugling elk.           Steamboat What's it like to witness an eruption of the world's largest active geyser? Three employees share their story from the night of September 3, 2014.            Backyard Owls Great horned owls live in Alaska, Florida and virtually everywhere in-between, but people rarely get to see them because they mostly hunt at night. This spring, a pair of owls delighted crowds in Mammoth Hot Springs when they established a visible nest and hunted during the day since that's when local prey (the Uinta ground squirrel) is most active.            Morning Fog Every so often, the air temperature and dew point conspire to create a misty morning along the river valleys of the northern range.            Ruffed Grouse A male ruffed grouse claims his territory in the forest near Mammoth Hot Springs. During this ritual display, the grouse beats its wings in a series of thumps that builds to a resonant crescendo, the bird's wings blurring with speed.            Chorus Frogs If you've visited Yellowstone during spring, you've probably heard the all-male chorus of the boreal chorus frog: but actually seeing them is another matter. Ranger Rita Garcia reminisces about discovering them for the first time.           Spring Sunset Sonic The sounds of spring fill the air as the sun sets on the Lower Geyser Basin. Featuring the slurps and gurgles of Fountain Pain Pot, the splashes of Clepsydra Geyser, the song of the American Robin, and the calls of a Sandhill Crane.           Spring Bears Bears have begun emerging from their winter dens in Yellowstone. As a grizzly forages near the Midway Geyser Basin, the park's bear management biologist explains early spring bear behavior, and how the public can both help bears and protect themselves over the next few months.            Rumor Control Should you worry about earthquakes near North America's largest volcano? Are animals fleeing the park? Public Affairs Chief Al Nash sets the record straight on a few stories circulating about Yellowstone.           Spring Plowing If you've ever wondered why it takes us so long to transition from oversnow travel to wheeled vehicles, grab a front row seat to the park's plowing operations            Twofer Yellowstone's Upper Geyser Basin boasts the highest concentration of geysers in the world. Even so, watching two at once makes it a special day. In this video, Castle Geyser is accompanied by a distant favorite: Old Faithful.            Winter Driving Winter drivers face a number of potential hazards in Yellowstone, including black ice, snow-packed roads and whiteouts. Evaluate conditions before you head out, and drive carefully so that you can spend your time watching wildlife instead of waiting for a tow truck.           Hidden Gems in Pebble Creek Enjoy the unusual ice formations along Pebble Creek as this slow stream transitions from late fall to winter.      This project is supported by Canon U.S.A., Inc., through a grant to the Yellowstone Park Foundation, the official fundraising partner of Yellowstone National Park.
