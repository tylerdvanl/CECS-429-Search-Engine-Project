The diversity of natural, cultural and recreational resources in the park-and presence of 17 private communities, a county park and New York State's only federally designated wilderness within the boundaries of the park-all require careful coordination as all stakeholders work toward common goals. A variety of organizations help the National Park Service fulfill its mission.      Partners operating under Cooperating Association Agreements Eastern National This cooperating association maintains sales outlets at Watch Hill, Sailors Haven, Wilderness visitor centers and at the William Floyd Estate.
