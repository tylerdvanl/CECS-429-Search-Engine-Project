    "body": "Plan A Field Trip       SCHEDULING EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS Devils Postpile National Monument is a great place to bring educational groups! Programs are available throughout the summer and fall in the monument and rangers may be available to come to the classroom during the winter season as well. To schedule educational programs in the monument or in the classroom, please contact 760-924-5505 (Mid-October through Mid-June) or 760-934-2289 (Mid-June through Mid-October). FEES AND FEE WAIVER INFORMATION The fee waiver process has changed. Effective immediately, Devils Postpile will no longer be handling fee waiver applications. The process has been streamlined and will go through the Inyo National Forest. The U.S. Forest Service is authorized to waive the standard amenity fees in the Reds Meadow Valley for certain individuals and groups, as outlined by the Recreation Enhancement Act. If seeking a fee waiver, please bring proof of age or documentation demonstrating your group's affiliation with a school or academic institution or a copy of your special use permit issued by the U.S. Forest Service. This documentation can be presented to the staff at the Minaret Vista Station upon your arrival. Devils Postpile requests that should you wish to schedule any educational programs or tours that you call in advance of your visit to schedule those. Please call 760-924-5500 with any questions regarding the fee waiver process. Below are the specifics of the authority to grant fee waiver requests. PROHIBITION ON FEES FOR CERTAIN PERSONS OR PLACES: The Secretary shall not charge an entrance fee or standard amenity recreation fee for the following:   1. Any person under 16 years of age. 2. Outings conducted for noncommercial educational purposes by schools or bona fide academic institutions. 3. Any person engaged in a nonrecreational activity authorized under a valid permit issued under any other Act, including a valid grazing permit.",
