It was led by Robert F. Brown. Although the trip was intended to be of a preliminary nature and lasted only 10 days, more surveying and scientific research was conducted during these 10 days then all other previous times. Approximately 3 miles of cave were mapped. A good portion of this was the resurvey of tour routes, but it also included a large section of the northwest part of the cave including the surveys of places such as: the Attic, Plummer’s Pit, the Bishop Fowler’s Loop, and Brown Canyon. During the expedition and with additional months of laboratory work, enough information was collected and analyzed to permit a complete study of the cave’s mineralogy, a reconnaissance of the cave’s fauna, and a preliminary account of the cave’s geology.       Preface Expedition Report  Appendix I - Wind Cave Expedition Organizational Chart Appendix II - Expedition Personnel Appendix III - Cave Rescue Procedure  Report on the Wind Cave Survey Preliminary Report on the Geology and Mineralogy of Wind Cave, Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota Regional Geology  Karst and Drainage Cave Patterns and Cross-Sections Structural Relationships Stratigraphic Relationships Solutional Features Sediments and Breakdown Mineralogy  Recommendations for Future Work A Faunal Survey of Wind Cave Some Data on the Meteorology of Wind Cave",
