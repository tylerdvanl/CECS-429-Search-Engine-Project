Trees provide us with precious timber, but left standing, they help clean the air of pollutants and stabilize the Earthâ€™s temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide levels. In addition, forests provide shelter for wildlife and aesthetic pleasure for people. Timpanogos Cave National Monument has three different forest types: Montane Chaparral\/Shrub, Mixed-Conifer Forest, and Quaking Aspen Forest. Montane Chaparral\/Shrub: This forest is found mostly on the south-facing slope of the park where the soil is poor and dry. Composed primarily of Gambel oak and Bigtooth maple, Montane Chaparral\/Shrub communities also contain Curleaf mountain mahogany, Rubber rabbitbrush, and Cliff rose. In the winter, Mule deer depend heavily on this vegetation type for food.  Mixed-Conifer Forest: Found along the cave trail, this forest consists mostly of Douglas fir and white fir.  The rich, moist soils allow for the development of a diverse understory of forbs, grasses, and shrubs. Mixed-Conifer Forests historically have burnt every 10 years; however, with fire suppression, this no longer occurs. In absence of fire, these forests have undergone major changes in structure and species composition. Quaking Aspen Forest: At the top of the monument above the cave on the north facing slope, communities of Aspen can be found. Here, large amounts of sunlight and favorable soil conditions create a rich understory of grasses, forbs, and shrubs. Aspens reproduce by cloning: creating forests of trees that are all genetically identical.",
