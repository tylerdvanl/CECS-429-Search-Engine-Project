It will enable more schools to bring their students to the park and experience the stories of the battlefields and historic sites firsthand. As part of the National Park Foundation's Open OutDoors for Kids program, this grant (funded in part by Disney) provides funding for materials and logistics to make national park field trips, citizen science projects, Junior Ranger activities, experiential learning opportunities, and more possible. Including this year's grantees, National Park Foundation grants have made it possible for more than 300,000 students to visit national parks. \"Through programs like Open OutDoors for Kids and the Find Your Park movement, we are creating the next generation of park stewards, connecting youth across the country to these special places and inspiring their natural curiosity and love for them,\" said Will Shafroth, president and CEO of the National Park Foundation. \"We are grateful to all of our partners, including Disney, that make such programs possible and help more people find their park.\" \"By sharing parks with kids at such a young age, we're building a strong generation of park stewards who will care for and protect these treasured places into the next 100 years,\" said Jonathan B. Jarvis, director of the National Park Service. \"Thanks to our philanthropic partner, the National Park Foundation, we're able to strengthen and enrich our parks through the lasting bond these experiences foster.\" Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park would like all schools in the region to make annual field trips to the park. Local social studies coordinators state that the cost of busing is the number one determinant of whether or not classes have the opportunity to go on field trips. The grant funding will reimburse the cost of buses with extra funds available for schools that have to travel further than others. \"The battlefields are the best resources to learn about the Civil War, and we are fortunate to have several in our area\" believes Peter Maugle, Education Coordinator at Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park. \"Students, especially from this part of Virginia, should visit these places to better comprehend the significance of what occurred there, and foster their appreciation for how it affects us today.\" Interested in scheduling a field trip to the park?
