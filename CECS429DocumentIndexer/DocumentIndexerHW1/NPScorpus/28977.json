    "body": "“...plain republicans of the north and planters of the south.”  Politics before the Civil War was a whirlwind of opposing interest groups. Martin Van Buren was able to unite those groups becoming president in 1837. As frustration and violence over the extension of slavery grew in the 1840's, Van Buren ran for the presidency twice more from this house. He hoped to unite sectional interests but failed; ultimately so did the union.              Daily Tours of the President's Home.
