Junior Ranger programs in the summer are geared for children ages 6-12. Younger children may participate but must be accompanied by a parent or guardian. Short hikes, picnic areas and campgrounds can accommodate families with children. Bring your Scout troop to the park to work on merit badges! Teachers can sign up for field trips and bring their class to the park. Special events throughout the year have activities designed for children.     Â     Junior Rangers pledge to learn about the park, protect its special resources and help others to do the same. NPS Photo",
