    "body": "Management       The National Park Service Civil War Defenses of Washington sites are under the management of three separate units:  National Capital Parks-East  Rock Creek Park George Washington Memorial Parkway  Because the management of these sites is divided among three parks, a Final Management Planwas developed in 2004 to provide a unified management concept for the significant cultural and natural resources associated with the Civil War Defenses of Washington.   This plan will guide the management of the parks over the next 10-15 years. The Final Management Plan is presented here in two parts for those who would like to learn more:  Final Management Plan - Part 1 Final Management Plan - Part 2    Civil War Defenses of Washington Trail   Learn more about the history of the linear parklands connecting the Civil War fort sites. Immediately following the end of the Civil War, a scenic parkway was proposed to connect the forts and to preserve them.  In 1902, the McMillan Commission supported this vision, and in the 1930's the National Park Service began to acquire the land for Fort Drive. Small sections were built, but the vast majority was not. The legacy of this vision is a necklace of linear parkland surrounding Washington, D.C., envisioned as trail network.  Check out the new CWDW Trail Brochure to learn more.",
