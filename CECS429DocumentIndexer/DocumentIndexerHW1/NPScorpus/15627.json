    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Safety            Safety       1) Watch your step on the wood steps and stone doorways when they're wet, or covered with ice or snow; they can be very slippery under those conditions. 2) Summers can be extremely hot and winters can be very cold so please take the proper seasonal precautions when walking around the fort. See the weather page for information about the western Kansas climate. 3) Thunderstorms are possible during the spring, summer and fall so be prepared to take cover in those situations. In the event of a violent storm or tornado, Fort Larned staff will direct you to planned safe zones. 4) Please follow all instructions when viewing historic weapons firing demonstrations.       Kansas weather can change quickly. Doug Kuony",
