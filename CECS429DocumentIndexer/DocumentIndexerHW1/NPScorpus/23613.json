    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Pets              Pets          Leashed pets are allowed on trails. However, pets are not permitted inside public buildings with the exception of service animals on a leash. Heat can be deadly for pets. Car temperatures rise quickly in the sun, even on cool days. If you leave a pet in a car, crack the windows as much as possible and leave water to drink. Please do not leave pets in the car at all, even with the windows cracked, when temperatures are above 68 degrees.   Why must pets be on a leash inside the boundaries of Pecos National Historical Park? For pet's safety (vehicles in the parking lot, other animals). For the safety of others (many visitors are uneasy around loose pets; please respect the rights of others who may have a fear of your pet--even a friendly one).  For the protection of wildlife (unleashed pets chase birds and other wildlife; also, it's unsafe for pets to go off trail due to danger from rattlesnakes). Remember, there is very little shade on the main loop trail and pets are not allowed in buildings, so please bring plenty of water!      Civil War Weekend: Showdown at Kozlowski's Trading Post.
