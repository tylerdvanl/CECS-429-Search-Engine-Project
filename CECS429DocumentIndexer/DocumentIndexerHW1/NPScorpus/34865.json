Visitor Centers       Natural Bridges Visitor Center The Natural Bridges Visitor Center is open daily 9 am to 5 pm with extended hours in the summer. Exhibits, a video presentation, and a bookstore are available. You can pay your entrance fee at the visitor center.           Â    Most visitors spend at least two to three hours exploring Natural Bridges. Plan on stopping at the visitor center and touring the paved, one-way Bridge View Drive (9 miles\/14.5 km) with overlooks of all three bridges. Several short hiking trails offer closer inspection of these remarkable formations, while longer trails follow the canyon bottom or mesa top connecting all three. Each overlook and trailhead has limited parking; if towing a trailer, unhook it and leave it in the visitor center parking lot.
