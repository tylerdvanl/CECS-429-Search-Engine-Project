Please keep in mind that quiet hours are from 10:00 pm to 6:00 am. Others want to sleep for their big day floating or may have children who go to bed early. Please respect your neighbors. Please DO NOT BRING FIREWOOD! Moving firewood around the country helps spread forest pests like the Emerald Ash Borer and Gypsy Moth. You can gather any dead and down wood around the park, or buy local firewood at roadside stands, stores or canoe rentals. (Don't take it home with you, either.) For more info click here. Keep a clean camp, small critters like skunks, crows and raccoons will certainly visit you, looking for a handout. Be prepared to keep your food and garbage either in a vehicle or hanging up high. Otherwise you may wake up to a mess and no breakfast! If you keep a cleaner camp than your neighbors, maybe the little guys will bother them instead!  We have bears in the area, they haven't been a problem yet and we want to keep it that way. Please help by not making it easy for them to steal food or garbage. More about camping with bears. Lastly, this is a family friendly place. If you insist on being loud, obnoxious or using profanity, you can expect to be asked to leave.
