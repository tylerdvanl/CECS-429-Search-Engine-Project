Exotic species have a negative impact on natural resources, native plant communities, and management activities associated with them. It is important to remove exotic species because they out-compete native vegetation and encroach on the natural areas in the park. Often times, after exotics have had the opportunity to establish themselves within a particular community they will dominate that area, creating what is known as a monoculture. After the exotics have established themselves, they will quickly spread and not allow any other species to grow there. Maintaining biological diversity with the presence of these invasive species is an ongoing struggle that consumes countless resources at the park and national level.",
