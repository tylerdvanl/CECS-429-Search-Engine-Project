The men then built a monument on the site of their valiant stand. Bierce used this oldest intact Civil War monument as the backdrop for one of his stories, \"A Resumed Identity\" to tell people about the horrors of war.         A Bad End for a Good Boy Private Henry Hall traded his militia coat in for a Confederate uniform as he headed south with the Fourth Kentucky Infantry, CSA. Sadly, he died on January 2, 1863. His coat and a letter to Henry's mother describing him as, \"A good boy and a good soldier,\" are on display in the park museum         Forever Free Emancipation Proclamation On January 1, 1863, the opposing armies outside Murfreesboro spent the day reorganizing and tending to the dead and wounded. The same day, President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. The Union victory at Stones River supported the proclamation and changed the war into a conflict not just to preserve the Union, but also to end slavery.         Fortress Rosecrans Defense and Occupation This rare photograph shows men and cannons that defended Fortress Rosecrans. The earthen walls of the fort stretched three miles and protected a supply center crucial to the Union army's drive to Chattanooga. For the people of Murfreesboro, Fortress Rosecrans loomed as a grim reminder that the Union army controlled their town.         Living Free The Cemetery Community After the war, African Americans built their own thriving and prosperous community centered on the Stones River National Cemetery. The community was fittingly named \"Cemetery\" and included farms, homes, churches, and a school. Some of the people living there were veterans of the 111th United States Colored Infantry and their families.         Victory at Great Cost The Regular Brigade On December 31, 1862, Union soldiers of the Regular Brigade plunged into the woods to plug a hole in the line of soldiers at Stones River. They lost nearly half their men in less than an hour but held long enough to help the Union Army gain a victory. This monument honors their brave sacrifice.         William Holland From Property to Property Owner Holland's transition from slave to citizen represents one of the most important results of the Civil War. Born enslaved, he escaped to become a laborer and then a soldier in the 111th US Colored Infantry. After the war, Holland worked in Stones River National Cemetery and bought a small farm, where he and his grandson are buried.",
