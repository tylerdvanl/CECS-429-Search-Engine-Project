    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Safety            Safety       Emergency phone: 911  General Guidelines  Tides in the St Croix River range up to 24 feet. Use caution while walking in the intertidal zone — that is, the area between high and low tide. Seaweed and algae-covered rocks are very slippery! Check for ticks. Wear long pants and use insect repellent. When in doubt, ask a ranger first.           Ticks Ticks are prevalent in Maine. Mostly active late spring to early fall, these pesky biters can transmit Lyme disease and other illnesses. To protect yourself:  avoid brushy areas and dense leafy areas where ticks are abundant, wear long pants and sleeves, check your skin and clothes frequently for ticks, use an appropriate insect repellent containing DEET, shower soon after being outdoors.  For more information visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Ticks page.         Boating Safety  Four-wheel drive is required to launch trailered boats from the rudimentary boat launch. Plan ahead! It's best to launch and remove boats near high tide. From mid-May to mid-October, you can call the ranger station at (207) 454-3871 for tide times. A public commercial boat launch is located just 3 miles (5 km) south on ME-1 in the town of Robbinston. Kayaks are best launched at high tide. Paddlers beware! Strong currents are common in the St Croix River due to the extreme tidal range. Boaters are reminded that visits to Saint Croix Island are not recommended due to its fragile nature, both archeologically and geologically.",
