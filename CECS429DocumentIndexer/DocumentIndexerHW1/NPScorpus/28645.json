Podcasts are file systems that can be downloaded onto an iPod or mp3 player, then taken to the park for a 90-minute walking tour of a Gettysburg battlefield landmark. Podcasts are located on our partner's website at Civil War Traveler.com. There you will find detailed instructions on how to download the tour as well as maps that are essential for the listener to locate stops on the tour.
