If you're visiting while the site is open (late-May through late-October), stop at the park Visitor Center and pick up a Junior Ranger booklet, clipboard, and pencil.  We offer two booklets, a LOOK & FIND version for 5-8 year-olds and a THINK & REASON version for 9-12 year-olds.  Choose the booklet that is right for you, complete the activities by attending a tour and exploring the landscape, and you'll be read to take the Junior Ranger pledge! 2. If the site is not open, or if you'd like to stretch your legs a bit, we now offer a walking tour Junior Ranger booklet for 10-16 year-olds that will take you on a short exploration of the house and its surrounding neighborhood.
