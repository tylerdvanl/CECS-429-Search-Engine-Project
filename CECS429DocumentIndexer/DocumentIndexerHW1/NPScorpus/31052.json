Given the distance from Corpus Christi (approximately 23 miles) and from the nearest airport (approximately 40 miles), cab fares will be expensive.  Several car rental agencies serve the Corpus Christi area and are likely to be the least expensive alternative.  For more information on your options, please call the Corpus Christi Convention and Visitors Bureau at 1.800.766.2322.",
