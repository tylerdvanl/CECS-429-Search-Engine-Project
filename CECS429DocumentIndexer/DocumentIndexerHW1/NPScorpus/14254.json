    "body": "Oakland Plantation Garden         Visitors are welcome to take a few vegetables, but please leave some behind for others.   Park Staff invites you to experience our small garden. We have planted seasonal crops which were traditionally grown by the Oakland Plantation Community. In the spring our garden has tomatoes, okra, peppers, peas, squash, egg plant, and other vegetables. We also have cotton and tobacco; both traditional cash crops on the plantation.    Â     The garden is made possible by the hard work of park volunteers and staff.",
