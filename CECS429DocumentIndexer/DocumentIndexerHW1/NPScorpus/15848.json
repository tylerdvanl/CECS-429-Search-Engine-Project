The park consists of the George Rogers Clark Memorial, and a total of 26 acres. The grounds of George Rogers Clark National Historical Park include formally designed plantings installed during various periods of site development. There has been a concerted effort to bring the park back to the original landscape plan developed during the memorial period (1920s and 1930s). The original design intent for the memorial building and landscape is sustained by the National Park Service to perpetuate an atmosphere of respect that honors and conveys appreciation for the accomplishments of George Rogers Clark and his men.",
