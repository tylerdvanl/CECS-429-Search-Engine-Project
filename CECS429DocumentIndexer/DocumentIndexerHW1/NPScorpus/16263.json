NPS       Approximately 30% of the bird species that breed in Yellowstone depend on wetlands. Scientists are concerned about these species because wetlands are expected to diminish as global and local temperatures increase. They are monitoring the trumpeter swan, common loon, and colonial nesting species, like the double-crested cormorant and American white pelican. Yellowstone has years of data about the rate and success of nesting for some of these species, but little information about changes in the timing of nesting activity—an indicator of climate change.
