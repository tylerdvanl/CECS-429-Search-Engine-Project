The park's 17 minute overview video is close captioned. In the Spring, 2015, new restrooms will be available with universally accessible stalls.  General Grant's Headquarters Visitor Contact Station: The main entrance on the west wing includes a ramp which also leads to the fully accessible restrooms.

Five Forks Visitor Contact Station: The entire building is universally accessible.   Trails  The historic trails located in the Eastern Front Unit at tour stops 1, 5 (Fort Stedman), & 8 (Crater) are paved, however, there are areas of these trails where wheelchairs are discouraged.
