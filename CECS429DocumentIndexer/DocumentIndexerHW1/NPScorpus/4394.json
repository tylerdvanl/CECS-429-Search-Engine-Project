Historic Weapons Demonstrations (Windows Media) Historic Weapons Transcript      (pdf) Your visit to the Castillo is designed to be a self-guided one. There are many ways to enjoy and experience the Park. You can: Explore the fortress - by wandering through the fort's casements and taking in the exhibits you'll find there. Available brochures and maps will guide you around the site. Take in a Ranger Program - as Park Rangers give a variety of interpretive talks throughout the day on the history and culture of the Park. We invite you to join any program at any time. Watch the video - which is shown every hour. It's about twenty-five minutes long and features cannon and musket firing sequences as well as an outline of the Castillo's intricate history. View a demonstration - there are always re-enactors in period dress around the fort and they often give historical weapons demonstrations as well as presentations on the life and experiences of the colonists who dwelt here. Relax and ponder - as you take in the view of the city from the gundeck. The Fort's green offers a large recreation area perfect for a picnic or a shady nap.  Â    Look Up! Even though the Castillo is nestled in downtown St. Augustine, some celestial objects are bright enough to see. The International Space Station is one of them.",
