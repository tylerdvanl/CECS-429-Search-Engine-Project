Our people sang, danced, and prayed the same songs, dances, and prayers we continue today. We do these things for the good of ALL people – for life, health, and blessings; and continue what we are taught by our elders. When we participate in these activities, we help our communities, our people, and our children to continue as Pueblo people.\" – Affiliated Pueblo Committee Bandelier's museum collections contain works representing six pueblos with traditional ties to Bandelier – Cochiti, San Felipe, Santo Domingo, San Ildefonso, Santa Clara, and Zuni. These items connect the past to the present – the designs, the techniques, and the colors. While some things are unique to certain people or places, many of these works have roots in beliefs and traditions shared by Pueblo people. These vibrant pieces, new and old, highlight the values, resilience, and wisdom of the Pueblo people. See Bandelier's extensive museum collection",
