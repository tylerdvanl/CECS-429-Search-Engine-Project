You can continue walking east past Powell along the paved Rim Trail back to the Village (another 1.9 mi\/3.1 km) or get on a shuttle bus at Powell - westbound buses (toward Hermits Rest) or eastbound buses (toward Grand Canyon Village).      Panoramic River Views Along with a Quiet Forest Walk Walk or ride the Village Route bus to the Village Route Transfer, get on a Hermits Rest Route bus, ride to Monument Creek Vista and walk west along the paved Greenway Trail taking in spectacular canyon views to Pima Point (1.7 mi\/2.7 km) or Hermits Rest (2.8 mi\/4.5 km). The Greenway Trail is fully accessible from Monument Creek Vista to Pima Point. Westbound buses (toward Hermits Rest) will pick you up at each bus stop; eastbound buses (toward Grand Canyon Village) only stop at Pima.      During the busy seasons, the line can be long at the Village Route Transfer – you may have to wait two to three buses. If you don't want to wait in line and are up for a short, but strenuous hike, walk 0.7 mi\/1.1 km to Trailview Overlook, where you can board one of the shuttle buses or keep hiking out toward Hermits Rest. West of Trailview Overlook, the Rim Trail levels out and offers easy to moderate hiking for an additional 7.1 miles (11.4 km).        Touring Hermit Road   Beautiful Views and a Glorious Ride If you are more interested in cycling than walking, ride your bicycle (use your own or rent one from Bright Angel Bicycles near the Grand Canyon Visitor Center) out along Hermit Road and the Greenway Trail to Hermits Rest (one-way is 8.0 mi\/12.9 km).   You will get some great views of the canyon while feeling the wind on your face.  There are some steep sections along this route, so be prepared for an arduous ride. If you tire and do not want to continue further, get on one of the shuttle buses at a designated bus stop along Hermit Road - you can load your bike on a shuttle bus and take it back to the Village. When riding on Hermit Road, you must find a safe place to pull to the right shoulder and dismount when a shuttle bus passes.      When walking or cycling at the Grand Canyon, make sure to take your time and carry food and water with you. The South Rim of Grand Canyon averages 7,000 feet \/ 2,134 meters above sea level. Visitors with respiratory or heart problems may experience difficulties. Exercising at this elevation can be strenuous.      Shuttle Bus Home Page Village Route (Blue) Kaibab Rim Route (Orange) Hermit Road Route (Red) Tusayan Park & Ride (Purple) Hiker Express Shuttle",
