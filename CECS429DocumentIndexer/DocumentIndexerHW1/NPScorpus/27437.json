We are glad you are here! Tour Fee Presently tickets for the ranger-led tour of Delta-01 are issued daily on a first-come, first-served basis. In the fall of 2016 the park will begin charging an amenity fee for tours of the Delta-01 Launch Control Facility.   Park Passes Because Minuteman Missile is a fee-free park, we do not sell National Park passes (Golden Eagle, Golden Age, Golden Access, etc.). Passes can be purchased at the northeast entrance to Badlands National Park, four miles from the Minuteman Missile Visitor Center.",
