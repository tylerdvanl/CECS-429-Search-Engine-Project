Each gallery captures a different aspect of the park's seasons, activities, and beauty. Experience the winter ice roads, an eagle fight, a fresh wolf kill, and many other scenes. With proper credit, these National Park Service photos may be dowloaded for personal use--anything from school projects to websites. More albums will be added over time. Enjoy the scenes.       Video Presentations If a picture is worth a thousand words, a video can be an experience of a lifetime.  Learn what it takes to be a voyageur, get an in depth view of an invasive species found in the park's main lakes and stay tuned for more videos to come.         Podcast Presentations The Podcast Presentations section shares podcasts of several visitor destination sites at Voyageurs National Park. Each podcast lasts between five and fifteen minutes and the files may be downloaded for personal use on your devices. Each of these visitor destination sites can only be reached by watercraft. When travel is not possible, now you can experience the Minnesota gold rush at Little American Island or explore the imaginative rock creations at Ellsworth Rock Gardens. Vignettes of Voyageurs await.",
