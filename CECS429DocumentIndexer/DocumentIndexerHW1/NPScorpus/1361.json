    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Things To Do     Canoe Rentals & Floating Information              Riverways Outfitters      Call a canoe rental in the area of the river you would like to float. They will put you in, provide you with all equipment you'll need and pick you up at the end of your adventure. Some will even pick you up at your campsite or room and return you afterwards. Prices are competitive. Most also offer small stores where you can purchase soda, bait, sunscreen, chips and the other necessities for a day on the water. Many offer kayaks, rafts and tubes in addition to canoes. Rowdy behavior by a small minority of floaters has been a problem in the past. Law enforcement efforts have been increased, new rules are in place and serious efforts are being made to control those who would ruin others' experiences by their behavior. See the Superintendent's message about Rowdiness. If you have not been to the Riverways for some time, this is the time to come back. We have been making a difference on the rivers in controlling unacceptable behavior. In the unlikely event you have any problems, record the boat number and report it to a park ranger, county sheriff or canoe outfitter. The canoe outfitters and park staff are ready to serve you and we encourage you to again bring your families, friends and organized groups.If you wish to enjoy the natural wonders of our beautiful sparkling rivers in a family friendly atmosphere, c'mon down!         UPPER CURRENT RIVER LOWER CURRENT RIVER  JACKS FORK RIVER & MIDDLE CURRENT RIVER     Round Spring Canoe Rental 800-365-2537 Big Spring Canoe Rental 573-323-8156  Windy's Canoe Rental 886-889-8177    Silver Arrow Canoe Rental 800-333-6040 Current River Outfitters 573-323-8156 Jacks Fork Canoe Rental 800-333-5628    Carr's Canoe Rental 800-333-3956  Big Spring RV Camp 800-354-6295  Alley Spring Canoe Rental 888-963-5628    Running River Canoe Rental 800-226-6394  The Landing Canoe Rental 573-323-8156  Two Rivers Canoe Rental 888-833-4931    Jadwin Canoe Rental 800-937-4837  Hawthorne Canoe Rental 573-323-8156  Eminence Canoe Rental 800-723-1387    Akers Ferry Canoe Rental 800-33-FLOAT        Current River Canoe Rental 877-858-3250           Wild River Canoe Rental 800-33-FLOAT               Outfitters: Big Creek Trail Ride 877-932-4846 Tightline Fly Fishing 573-364-7633   Trail Ride Guides   573-226-3492 Trails End Stables 573-247-8580 Current River Guide Service 573-429-6589  Royal 7 Guide Company 314-810-7310  NO GLASS!
