NPS Photo  VISIT THE PEDESTAL The Statue of Liberty's stone pedestal was designed by famed architect Richard Morris Hunt. The pedestal was designed to complement the Statue of Liberty rather than overwhelm it. The structure was constructed and paid for by the American people. The pedestal is roughly half the height of the entire monument. The pedestal offers panoramic views of Ellis Island, New York, New Jersey and the New York Harbor. All pedestal tickets include access to the Liberty Island Museum.   Pedestal access is limited. Advanced reservations are highly recommended. See our Visiting the Pedestal page for more information.        Statue of Liberty's face recreated for the museum. NPS Photo  VISIT THE MUSEUM It took twenty-one years for the Statue of Liberty to progress from an idea in the mind of Edouard de Laboulaye to a colossal copper statue designed by the artist Frederic Bartholdi. The Liberty Island museum, located in the lobby of the pedestal, chronicles the difficulties and triumphs two countries overcame to build a symbol of freedom. The museum also covers how the Statue of Liberty's interpretation has changed since its erection in 1886.   A pedestal or crown ticket is required to access the Liberty Island museum. Please visit the Fees & Passes page for more information on pedestal and crown tickets. Most of the information in the museum, including photos of some of the artifacts, is available on our History and Culture page.         Ranger Yong leads his group through the Sculpture Garden NPS Photo  PARK RANGER GUIDED TOURS  Park Rangers provide English-language guided tours throughout the day.
