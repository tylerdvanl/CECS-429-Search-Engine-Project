We offer a variety of volunteer opportunities including visitor services, living history, natural resource management, and maintenance. We also offer volunteer internships for college students.   Volunteers are an essential part of the Shiloh National Military Park mission. Large yearly volunteer events include the Civil War Trust's annual Park Day each April, and National Public Lands Day every September. Volunteers of all ages are invited to come and provide assistance with painting, grounds maintenance, and monument preservation.   Next year the National Park Service will celebrate our 100th anniversary! Shiloh and Corinth are seeking volunteers for projects in 2015, as we prepare for our birthday, and for several special events we have planned in 2016. Special events will include the Battle of Shiloh's 154th anniversary, Memorial Day weekend activities, summer music events, and a luminary commemoration in Corinth in the fall.
