The grass and shrub covered dunes provides a picturesque setting to just wonder about, read the monuments or just sit down, relax and smell the fresh sea air. Take the walkway leading to the top of the dunes where one can overlook the Atlantic Ocean and the Entrance to the Chesapeake Bay. Take the walkway just to the south of the Cape Henry Memorial and walk down to the beach and enjoy the waves breaking upon the shore.  Â      The Cape Henry Lighthouse NPS Image  Although not a part of the National Park Service Cape Henry Memorial the more adventurous and hearty may want to climb the spiral stair case (approximately 165 steps) up to the top of the Cape Henry Lighthouse. This is not for the faint hearted, but the view is definitely worth the effort. This lighthouse is owned and operated by Preservation Virginia. For information about hours of operation, fees and restrictions please visit Preservation Virginia's Cape Henry Lighthouse at: http:\/\/preservationvirginia.org\/visit\/historic-properties\/cape-henry-lighthouse.",
