To find out how to hold your event at the park read the guidelines below.           A special use permit allows a short-term activity to take place in a park area. Events of this type require some degree of management from the National Park Service in order to protect park resources and the public interest. The National Park Service may permit a special park use, provided the activity aligns with the national park’s resources and purpose for which the park was established and will not interfere with park operations nor visitor experience.   Before submitting your application, please read the park’s guidelines listed below carefully and download all of the necessary documents.     Things To Know   Special use permits are granted at the discretion of the superintendent. Space is not reserved until the special use permit is signed and issued to the applicant.
