The National Park Service may permit a special park use providing the activity will not cause derogation of the Park's resources or values, visitor experiences, or the purpose for which the park was established. Primary concern will be given to potential resource damage and to anticipated disruption of normal public use. Steamtown National Historic Site requires that a Special Use Permit be obtained in advance. All permits require an application fee, reservations, and other fees, including the Park Entrance Fee. For further information and applicable forms on these uses, please click on the desired link. All application forms are in Adobe PDF format. Steamtown National Historic Site considers permits for special uses. Some types of events that would require a Special Use Permit are cultural programs, picnics, festivals, wedding ceremonies, events, film and photography projects, static displays, etc. When your application is under review, the office of the Superintendent will look at multiple criteria, including whether or not there is a meaningful association between the park and the event, and how the event contributes to visitor understanding of the significance of the park. Other criteria that will be factored in would be if we have programs or events during the requested time and if we have sufficient staffing.

BONDING Certain activities may trigger the need for the Permittee to post a refundable damage bond. The amount of the bond will be equivalent to the estimated cost to the NPS for clean-up, repair or rehab of resources that could potentially be impacted by the permit activities. At the conclusion of the permit, the bond will be returned to the Permittee after costs of clean-up, repair, or rehabilitation are deducted. Commercial Use Permits A \"Commercial Visitor Service\" means accommodations, facilities and services the NPS has determined to be necessary and\/or appropriate for public use and enjoyment of a Park area provided to Park area visitors for a fee or charge by person. The fee or charge paid by the visitor may be direct or indirect as part of the provision of comprehensive visitor services. Section 418 of the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998, Public Law 105-391, authorizes (but does not require) NPS, upon request, to issue Commercial Use Authorizations (CUA) to persons (referring to individuals, corporations, and other entities) to provide commercial services to Park area visitors in limited circumstances. CUAs, although used to authorize commercial services to Park area visitors, are NOT Concession Contracts. They are intended to provide a simple means to authorize suitable commercial services to visitors in Park areas in the limited circumstances in the legislation. The National Park Service does not allow sub-contracting under this authorization and authorizations cannot be transferred. The CUA must provide commercial liability insurance against claims arising out of or resulting from the acts or omissions of the CUA operator or the CUA operator's employees, agents, or contractors, in carrying out the activities and operations required and\/or authorized under the CUA. The CUA Specialist must receive verification of general liability (and transportation insurance, if applicable) coverage before a CUA can be issued and the coverage must be maintained as current during the term of the authorization. Additional insurance may be required as determined, based on the event and activities associated with this type of permit. Please also note that any food being sold on NPS property requires a valid\/current \"Serve Safe\" certificate. (https:\/\/www.servsafe.com\/home) as well as a copy of a valid\/current food license. Other Federal, state, and local laws may be required and additional permits may be required. Event requests involving alcohol shall be determined based on event and activities and, if permitted, additional insurance will be required. For Fees and payment information, please see the Payment Information section. Project Review All requests will be taken through the Project Review process.
