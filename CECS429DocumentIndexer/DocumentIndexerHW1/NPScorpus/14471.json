    "body": "Wildflowers          Â    Abraham Lincoln Birthplace is just a small part of the public lands that make up America's wildflower gardens. Plants and plant communities are critically important to humans and their environment. The many roles that they play range from subtle to obvious. The wildflowers of this area have great aesthetic value. Wildflowers beautify our world. They provide food for animals and like other plants that dot the hillsides they protect the soil from rain damage by holding the soil in place with their root systems. Like any treasure, they must be protected for all to enjoy. You can be a steward of these resources by:  Taking only photographs and memories when you leave Treading lightly and staying on the trails Leaving the flowers for others to enjoy  Examples of the flowers you might see at Abraham Lincoln Birthplace and The Boyhood Home at Knob Creek: White Flowers  Whorled milkweed Wild carrot  Spotted wintergreen White snakeroot - see why this plant has a connection with Abraham Lincoln click here Yellow Flowers Greyhead prairie coneflower  Blackeyed susan  Kidney-leaf buttercup Goldenrod Pink to Red Flowers Purple coneflower  Fire pink  Field thistle Bare stemmed ticktrefoil Orange Flowers Butterflyweed Blue Flowers Tall bellflower  Dwarf larkspur Self-heal  Blue mistflower Green to Brown Flowers Jack-in-the-pulpit Blue cohosh For more information on wildflowers you can visit http:\/\/www.wildflower.org\/",
