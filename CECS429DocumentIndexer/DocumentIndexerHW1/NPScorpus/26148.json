Find out at our Museum Collection Open House tours! In this popular program, visitors go behind the scenes inside our curation facility to get up close to actual artifacts that come to us through archaeological excavations or are donated by members of the community. Each month's open house focuses on a different topic - ranging from military history, to hygiene and health, to our present day archaeological excavations. Museum Collection Open Houses take place on the second Saturday of the month, on the schedule below. Two tours occur during the day: one at 11:00 AM and one at 2:00 PM. Tours are limited to 15 people. Children over 10 years old are welcome. Register in advance for a Museum Collection Open House tour by contacting Museum Technician Meagan Huff at (360) 816-6255, or by email. Registration for remaining spots on each tour can be reserved at the Ranger Station inside the fort on the day of the event.   2014 Schedule April 12, 2014: Dining at Fort Vancouver  What did the residents of Fort Vancouver eat?
