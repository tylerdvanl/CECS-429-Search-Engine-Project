(548.6-610 meters) long, 300-500 ft. (90-106.7 meters) deep and 300 ft. (90 meters) wide. In November of 1973 there was an eruption that lasted 31 days, creating the present crater floor. This eruption also opened a fissure east of the crater towards Puʻuhululu. This fissure eruption became a phase of the 1969-1974 Mauna Ulu eruptions. The last eruption of Pauahi occurred in 1979 for 16 days. There is a short boardwalk for viewing the crater and landscape, a photographic moment. Just left of the boardwalk, you will see a fissure that poured lava in the crater during the 1973 eruption. A rampart (a cinder and ash hill) was also created during that eruption. Pauahi Crater is culturally significant and religious to many of the Hawaiian people. At times you may view a \"Hoʻokupu\" (offering wrapped in Tī leaf), which should not be touched or disturbed.             Distance From the Beginning of Chain of Craters Road Distance From Kīlauea Visitor Center    Stop #1Lua Manu Crater 0.5 mi \/ 0.8 km 3.8 mi \/ 6.1 km    Stop #2Hilina Pali Road 2.3 mi \/ 3.7 km 5.6 mi \/ 9.0 km    Stop #3Pauahi Crater 3.3 mi \/ 5.3 km 6.6 mi \/ 10.6 km    Stop #4Mauna Ulu 3.7 mi \/ 6.0 km 7.0 mi \/ 11.3 km    Stop #5Mauna Ulu Flow Across Chain of Craters Road 4.1 mi \/ 6.6 km 7.4 mi \/ 11.9 km    Stop #6Mau Loa o Mauna Ulu 6.4 mi \/ 10.3 km 9.7 mi \/ 15.6 km    Stop #7Kealakomo Overlook 9.9 mi \/ 15.9 km 13.2 mi \/ 21.2 km    Stop #8Pu‘u Loa Petroglyphs  16.3 mi \/ 26.2 km 19.6 mi \/ 31.5 km    Stop #9Hōlei Sea Arch  18.8 mi \/ 30.3 km 22.1 mi \/ 35.6 km    Stop #10End of Chain of Craters Road  18.8 mi \/ 30.3 km 22.1 mi \/ 35.6 km          Return to: Drive Chain of Craters Road - main page Things to Do",
