Mostly spring-fed and running through some of the most beautiful Ozark scenery, they attract some 1.5 million visitors each year. Most come to float, fish, swim and otherwise partake of the rivers' charms. Water Quality Streamflow Information for the Jacks Fork and Current River in Ozark National Scenic Riverways (USGS Report, pdf file)   \"I started out thinking of America as highways and state lines. As I got to know it better, I began to think of it as rivers. Most of what I love about the country is a gift of the rivers. . . . America is a great story, and there is a river on every page of it. \"- (Charles Kuralt, On the Road With Charles Kuralt)",
