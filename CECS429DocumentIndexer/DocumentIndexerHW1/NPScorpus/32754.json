    "body": "Plan A Field Trip       The North Cascades Visitor Center, near the town of Newhalem along the North Cascades Highway, is a good starting point for a field trip to the park. It offers exhibits, audiovisual programs, and short trails. To help make your field trip educational, we have produced North Cascades National Park: A Living Classroom - Educator's Guide to Field Trips and Activities in Ross Lake National Recreation Area and North Cascades National Park. From time to time, the park offers workshops in using background material, lesson plans, and trip planning advice. If you are considering a field trip to this area of North Cascades, call 360-854-7305 to speak with our Education Specialist, at least 3 weeks in advance to see if park rangers will be able to assist you. If you are considering a field trip by boat to Stehekin, at the head of Lake Chelan, call 360-854-7305 to see whether ranger staff could present programs or other educational activities to your class. The park has prepared a publication to assist you: Opening the Door to the North Cascades - Educator's Guide to Field Trips and Activities in Lake Chelan National Recreation Area and North Cascades National Park. The lessons and activities in these currucula have been keyed to the Essential Academic Learning Requirements for Washington State.",
