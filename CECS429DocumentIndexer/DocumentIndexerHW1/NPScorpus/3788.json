    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility             Accessibility       Yukon-Charley Rivers is largely wilderness without trails, designated by Congress to remain a \"primitive\" area in many respects. The National Park Service strives to make the preserve's visitor center as universally accessible as possible. However, extra obstacles will be encountered in the backcountry because of the remote, wilderness nature of this special place.  If you have questions concerning accessibility, please contact us at 907 547-2233 or email us.  Also, learn about the The America the Beautiful National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Access Pass -- or simply, the Access Pass -- which provides a wide range of discounts on activities and services when you visit federal lands.",
