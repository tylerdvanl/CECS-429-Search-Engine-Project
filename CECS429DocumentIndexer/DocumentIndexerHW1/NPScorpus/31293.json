National Park Service  Celebrate Juneteenth   Juneteenth, also known as Freedom Day or Emancipation Day, is the oldest known celebration commemorating the ending of slavery in the United States.  On June 19, 1865, Union soldiers, led by Major General Gordon Granger, landed at Galveston, Texas with news that the Civil War had ended and that the enslaved were now free. General Order No. 3 stated, \"The people of Texas are informed that in accordance with a Proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free.\" This was two and a half years after President Abraham Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation.   This year, Juneteenth activities will be held on Thursday, June 16 from 1:30 PM - 3:00 PM and Saturday June 18, 2016 from 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM. For more information, see our flyer (PDF 274KB)",
