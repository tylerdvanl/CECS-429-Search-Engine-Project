    "title": "Voyageurs National Park: Firewood Restrictions",
    "body": "Firewood Restrictions       Firewood restrictions require visitors to purchase firewood from an approved Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) firewood vendor. Firewood may not be brought in from unapproved vendors. This is to protect forest health and prevent the spread of invasive pests. For more information about these restrictions and a list of approved vendors, visit the Minnesota DNR website.  Collecting wood for campfires is allowed only if the wood is dead and downed. Do not cut down any tree in the park, living or dead, for firewood.  Chainsaw use is prohibited. The Emerald Ash Borer attacks and kills ash trees. It is spread through the transportation of firewood. Find out ways you can help prevent the spread of this invasive species.",
