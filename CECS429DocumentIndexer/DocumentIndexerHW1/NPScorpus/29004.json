Please be flexible, as you may not get your first or second choice of dates. Class field trip sessions are offered on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at 10:30 and 11:30AM (we are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays.) We may also be able to offer slots in the afternoon, if that better suits your schedule. We can accommodate class groups no larger than 55 persons total. Adult chaperones must be provided at a ratio of one adult for every ten students. Please contact our group reservation coordinator for more information at SAHI_Reservations@nps.gov or e-mail us  Preferred bus route: From 106 North turn right on Route 25A (Northern Blvd) and to the Cove Road stoplight. Turn left onto Cove Road and travel for 1.7 miles to Cove Neck Road. Turn right on Cove Neck Road and follow the signs for 1.5 miles to Sagamore Hill Road and turn right. Follow Sagamore Hill Road to the end and you will see the Visitor Center. Preparing for the visit: Once your reservation is set, there are three important steps in planning any field trip to Sagamore Hill: 1. Teach at least one unit on Theodore Roosevelt prior to your visit to Sagamore Hill Adequate class preparation is essential to tie your curriculum with the material covered during your field trip to the Park. Students who have at least some background information on Theodore Roosevelt will have a much better experience at Sagamore Hill than those students who do not. For ideas, see the curriculum materials section of our website. 2. Bring your class here on schedule and prepared to spend 2 hours at the park Please arrive at least 10 minutes prior to your appointment and check in with a Park Ranger at the Visitor Center. Bus Parking: After unloading the students from the buses, please have the driver park in the designated bus parking spaces located in the third division of the lot. Also, please have the driver turn off the bus motor. (Idling is against the law!) Classes should be split into small groups numbering no more than 14 students. Students may visit the Old Orchard Museum to view exhibits, see one a short film on Theodore Roosevelt, and\/or complete one Junior Ranger program. Educational Program Resources We have structured our educational programs around curriculum-based Junior Ranger Activities that are interesting and enjoyable for the young visitor. Some are designed for class visits, while others are more appropriate for scouting groups; all are suitable for families with children ages eight and up. Junior Ranger Offerings: 1. Theodore Roosevelt and His Sagamore Hill Home - This activity is completed following a visit to the home of the 26th president. Children may do this when they visit with their families, or it is administered as a take-back-to-class activity for school groups who have visited as a follow up to the class visit. 2. The Theodore Roosevelt Museum History Hunt - Be a history detective and test your powers of observation. This activity is administered to young people and their families or during a site visit by school groups. For many children this will be their first Junior Ranger experience. 3. The Wonderbook of Nature: Exploring Natural History at Sagamore Hill - This activity book is a field guide to some selected species of plant and animal life found at Sagamore Hill. The activity teaches children to use a printed guide book to identify plants and animals. Appropriate for scouting groups or for a family activity. 4.
