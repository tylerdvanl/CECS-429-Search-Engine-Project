Come early, or come late (the crowds are light during the evening). Make a day of it -- plan a visit to another of the city's terrific attractions. During August and September, the crowds thin out as kids return to school. Fall is a busy time due to many group tours. The day after Thanksgiving is one of the busiest days so be sure to arrive early! Winter is a perfect time to visit! There are no lines for the trams, no waiting for movies, and the weather is surprisingly mild. Prolonged periods of extremely cold weather are rare, and in fact, records show that the temperature doesn't get lower than 32 degrees more than 25 days throughout the winter! When spring returns, so do the group tours. In May and early June, there are light crowds with minimal waiting. The weather is mild and the extended hours give your plans flexibility.
