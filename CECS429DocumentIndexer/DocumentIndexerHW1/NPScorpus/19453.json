Riparian habitats (lush shrubs and trees) found along the river's edge, rich green open-field environments, wooded hillsides and dry glades and rocky outcroppings are just a few of the unique habitats that provide a niche for the mammal species found within the park. The Buffalo National River is known to have more than 55 species of mammals, three of them are endangered bats that are found within the karst cave networks located on the hillsides and valley draws.
