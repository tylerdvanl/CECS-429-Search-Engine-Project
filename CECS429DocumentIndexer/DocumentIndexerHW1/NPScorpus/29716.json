    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility             Accessibility      Accessibility  Accessible entrance is at the rear (Franklin Street, or parking lot) entrance. Thanks to new renovations at the TR Inaugural Site, a handicapped entrance is now available.  Please use the main entrance to the rear (East, or Franklin Street side)  of the carriage house structure.  Handicapped parking for cars or vans is available in the Franklin Street parking lot.  Public areas of the museum are on the first and second floors.  Access is possible with no steps involved, and an elevator can provide access to the second floor.  A accessible restroom is available in the reception area. There is an accessible entrance (no stairs) available to the rear (Franklin Street) side of the museum. There are three steps if you approach from the front (Delaware Ave.) entrance.  If at all possible, it is recommended that persons with mobility-related disabilities be transported in a smaller vehicle that can access the parking lot, and enter from the rear. Remember that a full-sized bus cannot safely make the turn into the lot, so all buses will need to drop off on the street.   Be advised that the museum is set back from both Delaware Avenue and Franklin Street, so a walk of several feet will be necessary if being dropped off at the street by a bus.   The distance from Delaware Avenue is approximately 100 feet, partially over loose gravel.   The distance from Franklin Street is approximately 180 feet over paved surfaces.   No steps are necessary to tour the museum.   An elevator is available to provide access to the upper floor   The tour requires moderate walking, with periodic seating opportunities for limited numbers. Tour areas are accessible to ADA-standard wheelchairs. Segways are not allowed inside the museum as mobility aides.   If you have questions, please call 716-884-0095 for details.  A printed tour pamphlet for the hearing-impaired is available upon request.",
