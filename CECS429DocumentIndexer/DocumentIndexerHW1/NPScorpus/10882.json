    "body": "The First Eastern National Park  People have been drawn to the rugged coast of Maine throughout history. Awed by its beauty and diversity, early 20th-century visionaries donated the land that became Acadia National Park.

Which trails are closed? Answers to all these questions and more.        Camping   Looking to camp? Blackwoods, Seawall, and Schoodic Woods are the primary campgrounds in the park.
