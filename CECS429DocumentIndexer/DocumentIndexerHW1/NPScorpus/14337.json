The agricultural fertility of the soils long played a major role in the region’s development.  Soon after the French arrived and constructed Fort St. Jean Baptiste, settlers began clearing the fertile floodplains along the Red River.  They laid out their plantations using the French arpent land tenure system—long narrow lots that fronted on and ran perpendicular from the river to the back bayous.  Plantation owners acquired many of these arpents to create their large landholdings.  They located their plantation homes along the river, set back enough to provide views of the fields, orchards, agricultural buildings, and of course the river.
