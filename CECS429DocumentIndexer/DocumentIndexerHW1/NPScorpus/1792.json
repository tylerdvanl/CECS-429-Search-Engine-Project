    "body": "Experience A Legacy  Nestled between the Painted Desert and ponderosa highlands of northern Arizona, Wupatki is a landscape of legacies. Ancient pueblos dot red-rock outcroppings across miles of prairie. Where food and water seem impossible to find, people built pueblos, raised families, farmed, traded, and thrived. Today, if you linger and listen, earth and artifacts whisper their stories to us still.              Wupatki Announces 2016 Discovery Hikes   Wupatki rangers and volunteers will lead guided hikes to backcountry sites normally off-limits. Click here to see the schedule and details.",
