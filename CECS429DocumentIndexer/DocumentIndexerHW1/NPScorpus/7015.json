    "body": "Amphibians              North Dakota has a sparse fauna of amphibians and reptiles. While individual populations may get quite high, species diversity is low. The semi-arid climate provides only marginal conditions for breeding and hibernation of amphibians, while low winter temperatures and the short growing season appear to be primary limiting factors for reptiles. Several of the species listed below are very rare or infrequently found and are in quite localized populations.       Â       AMPHIBIANS Tiger Salamander Ambystoma tigrinum         Plains Spadefoot Toad Scaphiopus bombifrons    Great Plains Toad Bufo cognatus    Rocky Mountain (Woodhouse's) Toad Bufo woodhousei         Boreal Chorus Frog Pseudacris nigrita    Leopard Frog Rana pipiens",
