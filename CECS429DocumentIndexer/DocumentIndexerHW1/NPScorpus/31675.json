Dogs are great companions for enjoying the outdoors and are allowed on trails in New River Gorge National River. By popular demand, canine companions can participate in this challenge. To complete this challenge, each participating pet must hike 100 miles in the park with their human companion.   To register your dog, simply add your pet's name to your email when you register for this challenge (and indicate that this is a pet). Keep track of the miles your dog hikes in the park along with your own miles. Dogs who hike 100 miles will receive a special pet award.   Please respect all visitors to parks and help protect site resources by following the park's pet policies:    Dogs must be kept on a leash no longer than 6 feet at all times. Leashes protect pets from becoming lost, from hazardous wildlife encounters, and from scaring or threatening wildlife. Leashes also protect other visitors who may be afraid, allergic, or who do not want a pet approaching them.    Pick up your pet's excrement. It is unpleasant to encounter and degrades the park's ecosystem.    Bring water for your pet do drink on your hikes. Streams may contain bacteria or parasites such as Giardia that are harmful to you and your pet.       Upcoming Hikes: * Reservation REQUIRED for most of these hikes: 304-894-2129 or getactiveinthepark@gmail.com  Dates and Locations:   July 1, 7:00 am to 9:30 am, Endless Wall Trail, 3 miles, meet at Nuttall Trailhead on Lansing-Edmond Road in Lansing. * RSVP - first eight cars (carpool encouraged).
