Click here to Plan A Field Trip      Curriculum-Based Education Field Trips Before visiting the monument, we need ALL visitors to help protect our bats. A fatal disease in bats known as White-Nose Syndrome has already killed over a million bats in eastern North America, and is spreading west. Avoid spreading the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome in bats! Inform all students and chaperones before your visit to Oregon Caves that they must plan ahead not to bring any items that have been worn or used in any cave, mine, or bat hibernation site east of the Rocky Mountains after 2005, or in any cave in Europe. This includes shoes, camera bags, and clothes. Even if the item has been washed, there is still a risk. Do not bring it.
