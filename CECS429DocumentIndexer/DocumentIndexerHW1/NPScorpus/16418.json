NPS\/Neal Herbert       Yellowstone provides a valuable study area; information about the status and trends of reptiles here may shed light on declines documented in other high-elevation protected areas of the western United States. Many reptiles congregate to breed or overwinter, and they can be adversely affected by disturbance or loss of key sites.      Quick Facts Number in Yellowstone  Six species: bull snake, prairie rattlesnake, rubber boa, sagebrush lizard, valley garter snake, and wandering garter snake. They are less studied than amphibians in Yellowstone.  Status   None of the park’s reptiles are federally listed as threatened or endangered.  Researchers began inventorying reptiles and amphibians in 2000.            Bull Snake           Prairie Rattlesnake           Rubber Boa           Sagebrush Lizard           Valley Garter Snake           Wandering Garter Snake      More Information  More on Reptiles: Bull Snake, Prairie Rattlesnake, Rubber Boa, Sagebrush Lizard, Valley Garter Snake, and Wandering Garter Snake  References The list below includes academic publications, government publications, management documents that inform the decision-making process at parks and protected areas, as well as links to websites that provide additional relevant information.
