In these two papers, Opler observes how complex emotions and ideas of inmates were given freer expression in Japanese, to think beyond the loyal\/disloyal paradigm that was imposed by the English language and the dominant culture; and the rise of traditional Japanese traditions and myths as a response to the stresses of incarceration at Tule Lake.
