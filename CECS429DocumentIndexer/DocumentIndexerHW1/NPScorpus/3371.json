    "title": "Fort Matanzas National Monument: Accessibility",
    "body": "Accessibility       The Visitor Center, restrooms, and dock are fully wheelchair accessible.  The ferry boat to the fort and the fort itself are not accessible.  There are two steps with railings to get into the boat. There is a shell path and a stairway of fifteen steps to get up into the fort.  Wheelchairs may be taken on the boat, but the individual must be able to negotiate the two steps onto and off of the boat.  There is a bench at the fort at ground level for people who do not wish or are unable to climb the steps into the fort. The boardwalk Nature Trail is mostly accessible with two short stretches of sand where the trail crosses a service road.  The boardwalks to the ocean and river beaches, located ¼ mile south of the main park entrance, are accessible except at the ends where steps lead to the beach. Handicapped parking is available in each of the parking areas.  Service animals are allowed in the Visitor Center, on the boat, and at the fort.    The park brochure and the Nature Trail guide are available in Braille upon request as is a captioned version of the park’s 8-minute orientation film.",
