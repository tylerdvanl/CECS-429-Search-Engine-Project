    "body": "Hiking         Obed has approximately 20 miles of trails.   Regardless of the time of year, every season offers its own special rewards to those who take the time to explore the Obed Wild and Scenic River on foot. Visitors interested in a short, easy walk will enjoy the hike to Lilly Bluff Overlook or the self-guided Emory River Nature Trail. An interpretive brochure is available at the trailhead. For a somewhat longer and even more spectacular hike, start on the path to Lilly Bluff Overlook and then turn right onto the Point Trail. The Cumberland Trail provides a challenging and extremely scenic alternative for those interested in longer day hikes or in backpacking trips.
