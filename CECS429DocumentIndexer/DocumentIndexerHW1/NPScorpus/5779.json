Inaugurated by the Academy of American Poets in 1996, National Poetry Month is held each April, when schools, publishers, libraries, booksellers, and poets celebrate poetry and its vital place in American culture. Big Cypress National Preserve has conducted poetry contests for the past three years.  This year, 2016, we are taking a break from conducting the contest, but check back in 2017 to get involved with the contest.
