    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility             Accessibility          Accessibility varies greatly along the California National Historic Trail. Each site and landowner varies in the level of services. We have developed an Auto Tour Route to follow the trail via major highways and many segments of the trail can be viewed by automobile. Some sites may provide accessible trails or pathways for touring an area. A variety of visitor centers along the trail provide video and audio programs, and occasionally tactile or interactive exhibits. Learn more about sites along the trail on our Places to Go page. For sight impaired visitors we provide our official map and guide in large font format on our Brochures page.",
