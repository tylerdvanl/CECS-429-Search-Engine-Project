The strong skirmish line on May 2 held the attention of Joe Hooker allowing \"Stonewall\" Jackson to march around Hooker's army and attack his flank. A two-mile trail goes across what is now a field (young trees in 1863) to the Confederate skirmish line on the high ground shown in the background of the photo just before the woodline.       Map of McLaws's Trail          Lee-Jackson Bivouac tour stop   Proceed to Tour Stop, Lee-Jackson Bivouac",
