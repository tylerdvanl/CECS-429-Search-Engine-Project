And thank you for supporting them, and us.         Eastern National, a proud partner of the National Park Service and Fort Donelson National Battlefield. Eastern National  When you visit an Eastern National store in a National Park, you are guaranteed to find quality items that will enhance your visit. Whether it be a terrific book on the Battle of Fort Donelson, books about notable persons from the Battle, or a reproduction canteen that helps us understand a soldier's life, you will find unique items in the store. And Eastern National returns the proceeds of their sales to the parks, so your purchase truly makes a difference. So far, in 2010, special funding from Eastern National has allowed the park to purchase some rare and fascinating documents from the Fort Donelson campaign, which we would not have been able to acquire otherwise.        Eastern National has made this book available to those wishing to learn more about the Fort Donelson campaign. It is available at both the visitor center bookstore and at www.eparks.com.",
