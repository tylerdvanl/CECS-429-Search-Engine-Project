Would you like to help preserve the wonderfully rich natural and cultural resources protected here? There are many ways to become more involved ... Consider becoming a VIP-a participant in the Volunteers In Parks program, that is. The park could not function without the efforts of its dedicated volunteers. As a VIP you can help the park provide educational programs for visitors, assist rangers to protect the park's priceless natural and cultural resources-there are many rewarding opportunities awaiting you. Share your talents today! If you'd like to make a donation to the park, please visit the Washington's National Park Fund, the official fund raising partner for Olympic National Park. The Fund connects people who care to our national parks, so they can show their support. Or do a bit of shopping at the Discover Your Northwest store. This nonprofit partner of the park promotes the discovery of Northwest public lands and enriches visitors' experiences by selling books and other educational materials at park visitor centers.    You may enjoy becoming a Friend of Olympic National Park. The Friends' goal is to promote understanding of the Park's ecological, educational, economic, and recreational importance and work with Olympic National Park on special projects.",
