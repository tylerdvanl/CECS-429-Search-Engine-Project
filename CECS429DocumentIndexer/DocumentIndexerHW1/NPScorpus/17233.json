The ADA defines a service animal as any guide dog, signal dog, or other animal individually trained to provide assistance to an individual with a disability. If they meet this definition, animals are considered service animals under the ADA regardless of whether they have been licensed or certified by a state or local government. Pets On The Park Grounds  Eugene O'Neill owned several dogs in his life. Here at Tao House, it was the beloved Dalmatian \"Blemie\" that kept the family company. All dogs here at Eugene O\"Neill NHS, though loved, must remained on leash while in the park. This is for their safety, as well as for visitors and wildlife. Even when passing through the park on the way to or from Las Trampas Regional Wilderness, please keep your pet on it's leash.",
