    "body": "Blackbrush Seed Collection Project         The seeds collected by this group created a layer 4-6 inches deep in the bed of the truck.   By now, many of you have probably heard about the Interagency volunteer seed collection effort we are mounting. Blackbrush is a mid-elevational plant that does not produce seeds every year, instead it produces seeds only every 5-7 years. Large portions of blackbrush habitats in southern Nevada have burned in the past few years, and may take centuries to recover without management intervention. We have scheduled five consecutive Saturdays; May 31st, June 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th at various locations across the different land management agencies in southern Nevada. On May 31st, we had 23 volunteers come out and help us kick off this effort. This group was supported by seven agency personnel for collection, and Lake Mead NRA engine crew chipped in to provide EMS support. This group was able to collect approximately one hundred pounds (45 gallons) of material, which will yield thousands of seeds that we can use for future revegetation projects in the Newberry mountains.
