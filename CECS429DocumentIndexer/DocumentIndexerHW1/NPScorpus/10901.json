When the Constitution of the United States was finally ratified, the African, the Native American and the Female were not included as fully vested, voting members of the new democracy. That privilege, that right to vote, would still have to be fought for, and that fight would be long, painful and bloody. These two struggles for freedom and equality, major reform movements of the 19th  & 20th centuries, were connected - for women played an active role in the anti-slavery movement and would, in turn, become the leading advocates for their own freedom and equality.

It was here where the workers began that migration from the farm to the factory. The daily work schedule was no longer dictated by the movement of the sun, but by the clanging of the factory bell. It was a change that the workers had to adapt to, but there was another change as well, the development of the Factory Farm. After all mill workers had to eat too.  Join us as Along the Blackstone's Episode #62 introduces us to some of the men who milked the cows, loaded the hay, and transported the dairy products to rail heads throughout the Valley - all as part of the Factory Farm.  You'll get a chance to hear some great stories as farm life and mill life come together.                        ATB 11 Water Quality - for over 40 years people have been working on improving the Water Quality of the Blackstone River  Duration:30 minutes, 1 second",
