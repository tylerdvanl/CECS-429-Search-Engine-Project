The islands harbor an abundance of life, and the shallows serve as nursery grounds for countless marine species.  Boaters should be mindful of the depth of the water, as shallows are common.  Finding your way through this area of the park can be difficult, and it is strongly recommended that visitors reference NOAA Charts #11430 and 11432 to assist them. Those looking for some places to explore in the area may want to consider Turner River, Halfway Creek, Sandfly Island, or the East River.",
