This is one of many naturalization ceremonies taking place in national parks under a partnership between the National Park Service and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The ceremony is currently scheduled to take place at 11 am on Friday, September 23, 2016, at the Bear Valley Picnic Area at Point Reyes National Seashore. Parking is available adjacent to the picnic area. In 2010, the National Park Service and USCIS renewed a formal partnership to enhance citizenship ceremonies by holding them in national parks throughout the country. The agreement helps introduce new citizens to some of the nation's most significant natural resources and cultural heritage sites. These historic and picturesque sites provide an ideal backdrop for citizenship ceremonies, where new citizens can learn about and reflect on American identity and the responsibilities of citizenship.
