Say hi to the bear in the visitor center exhibits, visit the blacksmith shop, pilot a ship in the maritime museum, and much more.   Yes, there are times when the weather forces us to stay indoors. If you have times like that during your visit, plan to go to the Philip A. Hart Visitor Center in Empire. Watch the slide presentation that introduces you to the park and walk through the exhibit room and browse the store. You can also visit the Sleeping Bear Point Maritime Museum and walk through the US Life-Saving Service station and the boathouse. The Glen Haven General Store, Cannery Boathouse, and Blacksmith shop will also be open in the summer. If you are in Empire, stop into the Empire Historical Museum on M-22. They have an extensive collection of exhibits about the history of this area.",
