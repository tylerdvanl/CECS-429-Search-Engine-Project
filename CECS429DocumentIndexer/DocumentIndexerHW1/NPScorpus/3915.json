Photo courtesy of C.S. Robbins, USGS  The Eastern screech owl (Otus asio) is a small, nocturnal, predatory bird with prominent ear tufts and yellow eyes. Some of these owls have rusty plumage, while others are dark gray. Their excellent camouflage makes it difficult to spot them hiding out in tree branches and hollows by day, but a trained observer can easily hear their whinnies and songs both day and night. Listen to the call of an Eastern screech owl recorded at the Pinelands acoustic monitoring site.             Eastern Screech Owl     Listen to an Eastern screech owl recorded at the Pinelands site.
