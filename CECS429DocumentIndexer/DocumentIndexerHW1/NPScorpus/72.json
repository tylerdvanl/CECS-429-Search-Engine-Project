Air Quality What you see is not always the same. What you breathe is not always the same. Different air particles (particulates) reduce the view of the lakes, forests, and wetlands, negatively affect our health, and harm wildlife. Research provides information on particulates like nitrogen, sulfur, and mercury that reduce the park's air quality.    Climate Change Research  Addressing the potential impacts of climate change on lands in the National Park System is one of the highest NPS priorities. Climate change will affect all parks in the western Great Lakes Region, including Voyageurs.  Discover for yourself the climate change adaptation planning being done by these parks.        Aquatic Research Monitoring and maintaining the health of Voyageurs National Park aquatic ecosystems is a high priority in this water based park.      Inventory & Monitoring The Inventory and Monitoring Program is part of the National Park Service's effort to improve park management through greater reliance on scientific knowledge. Current Monitoring Programs at Voyageurs  Contaminants Forest Vegetation Songbirds Landscape Dynamics Water Quality Weather and Climate        Wildfire Research Impact of Wildfire on Levels of Mercury in Forested Watershed Systems  This United States Geological Survey (USGS) Scientific Investigations Report was prepared in cooperation with the National Park Service, Voyageurs National Park.       Wildlife Research  Park staff conduct ongoing research and monitor wildlife like moose, beaver, eagles, and more. Park staff also partner with many other government agencies and learning institutions in order to conduct the most up-to-date research.",
