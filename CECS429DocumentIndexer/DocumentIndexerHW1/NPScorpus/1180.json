Hidden among the trees are crystal clear lakes and fields of wildflowers that may surprise you. The subalpine ecosystem occupies elevations just below tree-line between 9,000 and 11,000 feet.         Subalpine forests give way to mountain lakes like Odessa Lake. NPS  A typical subalpine forest may consist mostly of subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce. However, previously-burned areas may contain varying amounts, or even almost pure stands, of lodgepole pine. Lodgepole seedlings do well in sunlight, often abundant after fire, but once the forest is established, plant succession may result in increasing amounts of spruce and subalpine fir. Ground cover in a previously-burned forest area often includes two species of huckleberry.    Limber pine, with flexible twigs and needles in groups of five, may also be part of subalpine forests. In high, windblown areas, limber pines often grow into grotesque shapes.    Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir, which grow straight and tall in the lower subalpine forests, become shorter and deformed nearer treeline. Even as the trunk grows upward, strong, cold, dry winds may destroy new growth on the windward side, leaving permanent growth only on the lee side of the trunk. Trees with branches on only one side are often called banner trees or flag trees.         Lush meadows of wildflowers grow tall in the subalpine. NPS  At treeline, tree seedlings may germinate on the lee side of rocks and grow only as high as the rock provides wind protection. Further growth is more horizontal than vertical, and additional rooting may occur where branches contact the soil. The resulting low growth of dense trees is called krummholz. Snow cover may protect krummholz trees during the winter, but branches higher than wind-shelters or snow cover are usually destroyed. Well-established krummholz trees may be several hundred to a thousand years old.       Follow the links below to learn about life in the Subalpine.            Black bears usually hang out in subalpine forests to  eat berries and seeds. Limber pine bark and needles are well adapted to harsh climates. Clark's Nutcrackers  are thrifty birds in more ways than one.                        Woodpeckers have no shortage of wood to do what they do best. Elephantella aren't out of place in wet mountain meadows. Snowshoe Hares use large hind feet to escape predators.           Trees     Engelmann Spruce  Subalpine Fir    Limber Pine        Shrubs     Cinquefoil  Wax Currant    Elder  Wood's Rose    Vaccinium        Herbaceous Plants     Colorado Blue Columbine  Heartleaf Arnica  Pipsissewa  Sneezeweed    Fairy Slipper  Lousewort  Sedge  Twinflower    Gentian  Needle Grass  Senecio        Birds     Blue Grouse  Gray Jay  Olive-Sided Flycatcher  Red Crossbill  Williamson's Sapsucker     Brown Creeper  Hermit Thrush  Pine Grosbeak  Ruby Crowned Kinglet White Breasted Nuthatch    Clark's Nutcracker  Mountain Chickadee  Pine Siskin  Stellar's Jay  Woodpecker (Downy and Hairy)    Dark-eyed Junco  Northern Goshawk  Raven  Townsend's Solitaire  Yellow-Rump Warbler      Mammals     Black Bear  Chipmunk Golden Mantled Ground Squirrel   Mule Deer  Shrew     Bobcat  Coyote  Long-Tailed Weasel  Nuttall's Cottontail  Snowshoe Hare    Bushy-Tailed Wood Rat  Deer Mouse  Meadow Vole  Pine Marten  Yellow-Bellied Marmot    Chickaree  Elk  Mountain Lion  Porcupine",
