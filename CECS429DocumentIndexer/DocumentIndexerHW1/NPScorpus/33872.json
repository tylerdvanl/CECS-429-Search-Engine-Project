Volunteers play a key role at Richmond National Battlefield Park and are active in many areas of park operations.  Volunteers will: • Learn about the Richmond National Battlefield Park and the National Park Service • Receive training in Richmond National Battlefield Park history, operations, and procedures • Have a flexible schedule • Enjoy the satisfaction and experience in communicating with and helping park visitors while representing the National Park Service • Be recognized for sharing their time, knowledge, and expertise      Types of Opportunities: Volunteers are needed across the many departments of Richmond National Battlefield Park. Most volunteers fall under two types of projects: interpretation and resource management.  Interpretation volunteers will work with rangers to help share the stories of Richmond National Battlefield Park by staffing visitor centers, giving tours, and working special events.
