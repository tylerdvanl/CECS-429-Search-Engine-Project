Watch and listen for beavers making a splash along the shorelines and hearing a gray wolf's howl during the night is a treat.  Moose and wolves are occassionally observed when hiking a trail on the interior of the park. The park is home to black bears, an abundance of white-tailed deer, and smaller mammals such as foxes, otters, muskrats, snowshoe hares, and weasels which may be seen crossing frozen lake surfaces during the winter.
