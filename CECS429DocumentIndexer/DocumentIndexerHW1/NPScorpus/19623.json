    "body": "\"Victory from Within\" Traveling Exhibit              Along with its partners, Andersonville National Historic Site is proud to sponsor the \"Victory From Within: The American Prisoner of War Experience\" traveling exhibition. After years of development, the traveling exhibit was completed in the fall of 2013. The intent of this exhibit is to introduce the public to the prisoner of war story.   Where is the Traveling Exhibit Now?  October 13, 2015 - May 4, 2016: Fort Douglas Military Museum (Salt Lake City, Utah)   Exhibit Overview The 1,200 square foot traveling exhibit is based on the thematic organization of the National POW Museum – Capture, Prison Life, Those Who Wait, and Freedom. Hosting facilities will need to meet NPS standards for temperature and humidity control and security to ensure the preservation of artifacts. Receiving institutions will set-up, promote and market the exhibit, arrange and bear costs for shipping, arrange for a former POW to attend the exhibit opening, host the exhibit for a three to six month period, use NPS-provided educational materials, and record the number of visitors.      Exhibit venue information and scheduling (PDF file; updated February 2016)                   \"Victory From Within\" POW Traveling Exhibit    13 Photos  Images showing the \"Victory From Within: The American Prisoner of War Experience\" POW Traveling Exhibit",
