We'll help you out by posting suggested hikes on this page. If you complete each suggested hike, you will have hiked 50 miles of park trails! We will also send out reminders each week on our Facebook page (DelWaterGapNPS) and you can share your adventures with us. Not up to a strenuous hike right off the bat? Don't worry, we will start out with easy trails and work our way up to harder ones.   The 50 Miles for 50 Years Hiking Challenge is a fun, personal challenge you do on your own or with friends. It is not a race. Some of the suggested trails are in remote areas, so be sure you are prepared for your hikes.
