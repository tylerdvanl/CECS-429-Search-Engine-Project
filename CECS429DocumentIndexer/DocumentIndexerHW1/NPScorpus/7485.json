Our park will be taking part in the 100th birthday of the National Park Service in 2016 by offering special events throughout the year. The year 2016 is also a special year for Bighorn Canyon NRA because it will be the 50th birthday for the park, and it will be the 150th anniversary of Fort CF Smith. Bighorn Canyon will be showing films about the great national parks around the country during the summer of 2016, and there will be a living history event about Fort CF Smith the last weekend of July in 2016.
