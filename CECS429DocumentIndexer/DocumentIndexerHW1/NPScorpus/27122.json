Trail Maps:  General Trail Map  Leave your vehicle behind and enjoy using almost 30 miles of trails to visit historic and natural sites in the park. To ensure your safety and to protect sensitive historic and natural resources in the park, you must abide by these common sense regulations:  Some former trails have been closed to public use. They were closed because they are unsafe and cannot be made safe, or because using the trails destroys natural or historic resources. If a trail is not shown on the map, it is closed and public use is not permitted. Please be a part of protecting your natural and cultural heritage by staying off closed trails. Trails are designated for certain uses, as shown on the map, in order to prevent resource damage. Using trails for undesignated uses damages resources and is prohibited. Off-trail use by bicycles causes profound damage to cultural and natural resources and is prohibited. Parking is permitted only in areas shown on the map. Parking on the grass damages cultural and natural resources and is prohibited. The use of skates, in-line skates, skateboards, and roller skis endangers other trail users and is prohibited throughout the park.
