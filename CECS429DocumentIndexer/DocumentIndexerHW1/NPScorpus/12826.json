This increase in non-native invasive plant species is a stumbling block to the park, which has been aggressively treating exotic plant species since the Trinity Fire in 1999. After this previous fire, non-native invasive species are estimated to have increased by as much as 400%. The treatments within this area were an overall success; however, the French Fire has provided an ideal environment for these non-native species to once again expand rapidly into previously uninfested areas both within the fire perimeter and the surrounding areas. Specifically, the objectives of this rehabilitation project are the following:   Control new and expanding non-native invasive plant populations within the French Fire.Monitor the effectiveness of control treatments.Map new non-native invasive plant infestations.Rehabilitate the most impacted areas with native seed and by planting willows.",
