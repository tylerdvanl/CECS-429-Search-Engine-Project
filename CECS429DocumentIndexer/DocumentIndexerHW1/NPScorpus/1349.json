Ozark National Scenic Riverways (ONSR) held a stakeholder workshop for the purpose of bringing together representatives of different interest groups for some frank discussion and creative thinking about the park's future management. The information gathered at the workshop will be used, along with all the public comments received, to assist the National Park Service (NPS) as it reviews the preliminary alternatives for possible revision and selects a preferred alternative for the Draft General Management Plan (GMP). The GMP is the guiding document that will steer the management of the park for the next 20 years and more, providing direction to the current and future administrations of the park. The final report for the stakeholder workshop is now available online on the NPS Planning, Environment and Public Comment (PEPC) website. To access the PEPC website in order to review the report visit: www.parkplanning.nps.gov\/ozar.  March 5, 2010  Ozark NSR Prepares for Modifications in Alley Spring Campground  February 22, 2010  Firearms Now Permitted In Ozark Riverways a new law allows firearms in the park if otherwise permitted under state law, except in buildings.

February 11, 2010  Ozark Riverways Plans to Conduct Prescribed Burns   January 13, 2010  General Management Plan Comments Available Online Due to the high level of interest in the Draft General Management Plan (GMP) for Ozark National Scenic Riverways the National Park Service (NPS) has made several documents available for public review. The GMP is the guiding document that will steer the management of the park for the next 20 years and more, providing direction to the current and future administrations of the park.   The NPS received a tremendous response to the preliminary alternatives for the GMP. The turnout at the five June 2009 open houses was very large and a high volume of written comments was submitted. Due to that volume, it has taken a while to read all of the comments, put them into the Planning, Environment, and Public Comment (PEPC) database, and prepare a summary for the public. Several documents have been developed that summarize the public comments received to date. To access the PEPC website in order to review these documents visit: http:\/\/parkplanning.nps.gov\/ Select Ozark NSR from the dropdown menu, then \"General Management Plan\" from the list of current projects, and then \"Document List\".  Given the variety of concerns and suggestions from the public, the NPS will be doing additional work in 2010 and 2011 to revise and refine the planning alternatives and develop the agency's preferred alternative. Included in this process will be work to better understand the impacts of these alternatives on the natural, cultural, social, and economic environment of the national riverways. The park will also be seeking funding to complete studies in the areas of social and natural science to support agency decisions.  The revised alternatives, including the NPS preferred alternative, will be presented in a printed Draft General Management Plan\/Wilderness Study\/Environmental Impact Statement. Upon release of this document, there will be an extensive public review and comment period. The NPS Midwest Regional Director will not approve a final management plan until all comments on the draft plan are reviewed and considered.  November 17, 2009  Shawnee Creek Campground Road Closed.
