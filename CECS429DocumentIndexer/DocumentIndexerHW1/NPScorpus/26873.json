If you choose to bring a pet with you, please be aware of the following restrictions. The following rules apply in all national parks:  Pets must be physically restrained at all times, either in a carrier, cage, or on a leash not to exceed 6 feet in length. Pets cannot be left unattended, or tied to an object, at any time unless in a designated area. Pet excrement must be collected and disposed of by the owner of the pet. Pets are not allowed on any trails or backcountry areas. Pets cannot be brought into public buildings, public transportation vehicle, or location designated as a swimming beach, or any area closed to possession by the superintendent. This does not apply to service animals. Allowing a pet to make noise that is unreasonable considering location, time of day or night, impact on park users or frightens wildlife by barking, howling, or making other noise is prohibited.
