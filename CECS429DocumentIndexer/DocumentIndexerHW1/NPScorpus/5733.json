    "body": "Nonnative Species       One of the largest threats to natural habitats, world-wide, is the biological invasion of non-native plants and animals. Ecosystems and the habitats within them have a natural balance that can be greatly altered by the introduction of non-native species. Billions are spent annually to eradicate invasive non-native species such as zebra mussels, Brazilian pepper, melaleuca and hundreds of other introduced plants and animals. In Florida alone it is estimated that there are over 900 established non-native plant and animal species. Not all of these species pose a major issue, but several can create ecological devastation.
