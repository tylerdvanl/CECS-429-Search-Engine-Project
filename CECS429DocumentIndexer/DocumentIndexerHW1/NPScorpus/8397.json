    "body": "Resource Stewardship Scout Rangers         Past volunteer projects include planting and weeding the rain gardens on Harkers Island.   Are you a scout or troop leader looking for a way to protect and preserve our National Parks while you visit? The Scout Ranger program might be just what you're looking for! Scouts who participate in educational or park approved volunteer programs or service projects at Cape Lookout and\/or other national parks can become Resource Stewardship Scout Rangers. More information on the Scout Ranger programs can be found by following these links to the Girl Scout Ranger Website or to the Boy Scout Ranger Website.      There are two levels to the Scout Ranger program. Once you have completed the required number of hours, report your work to a ranger or volunteer at the Harkers Island Visitor Center. You can do this by explaining what park approved projects you completed and what you learned about the park or you can show them your completed Scout Ranger Activity Tracking Sheet (this sheet is optional, but is an easy way to keep track of your completed activities and hours)           Scout Ranger Certificate -- Scouts who complete at least five (5) hours working on a service project and\/or attending education programs in a park are eligible to receive the Scout Ranger certificate.         Scout Ranger Patch -- Scouts who complete ten (10) or more hours working on a service project and\/or participating in educational programs are eligible to receive the Scout Ranger patch.      What counts towards Scout Ranger hours at Cape Lookout? Service Projects  Trash clean-up—especially on Shackleford Banks Other projects—do you have another project you'd like to do for the park? Tell us about it!   Please remember, all projects MUST be approved by the park before you begin.  Educational Programs  Scheduled Ranger programs Junior Ranger or Junior Ranger Adventures—each activity\/program book gives one hour of credit Other Ranger programs—contact the park to request a special program or time for your group. We do our best to accommodate these requests.       Share you Experience! Once you have received your Scout Ranger patch or certificate, you can e-mail a message and photographs to the National Park Service Youth Programs (e-mail us) or to Cape Lookout National Seashore (e-mail us).
