They only nest in northern, low lying tundra where permanent, fish-bearing lakes are nearby. The lakes need to be large and have clear water. These loons dive to retrieve aquatic plants and animals. Not only will they dive for food, but when scared, they choose to dive more often than fly to get away from danger.",
