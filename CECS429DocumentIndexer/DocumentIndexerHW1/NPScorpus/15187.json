General tax revenues provide most of that investment for Lassen Volcanic National Park. Entrance fees from those who directly use the park for recreation provide additional support for maintaining park services and facilities. Eighty percent of the fees collected at Lassen are returned to the park for specific projects. Each time you pay a park entrance fee, you are making a direct investment in your park.
