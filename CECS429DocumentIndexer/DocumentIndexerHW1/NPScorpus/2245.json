Unfortunately they don't always love us. Many GPS devices have difficulty finding our physical location. Often, they will direct you to our administrative offices at 6400 N. Highway 89, or they will direct you to follow dirt roads through the forest. If you are not in a high clearance, four-wheel-drive vehicle, you should avoid any unfamiliar roads that are not paved.  Physical Address: 6082 Sunset Crater Road, Flagstaff AZ, 86004.   By Car    From Flagstaff: take U.S. 89 north for 12 miles (19km), turn right on the Sunset Crater - Wupatki Loop road and continue 2 miles (3km) to the visitor center. Drive time from Flagstaff to Sunset Crater Volcano is 30 minutes.   Scenic Loop Drive: Sunset Crater Volcano is located along a 34 mile scenic loop road that takes you from open meadows and the beautiful Ponderosa pine forests surrounding Sunset Crater, through Juniper grasslands and view of the Painted Desert, to the open red rock landscape of the Wupatki Basin and Wupatki National Monument. Drive time along the Loop Road is about 1 hour.   By Plane Commercial airports serve Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Flagstaff.   Public Transportation   There is no public transportation into the park.
