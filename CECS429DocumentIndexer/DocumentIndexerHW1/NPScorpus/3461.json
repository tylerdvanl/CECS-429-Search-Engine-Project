NPS Photo  As part of the largest urban park system in America, the Timucuan Preserve has access to a wide variety of restaurants and hotels while still feeling removed from the hustle of the city.  Picnicking  A picnic shelter is located next to the Visitor Center at Fort Caroline.  Picnic tables are also available at the Cedar Point and Theodore Roosevelt Area sites. Picnicking on the grounds of Kingsley Plantation is welcomed but there are no formal facilities.  We ask that you do not bring food into the historic buildings and that all trash is properly disposed of in trash cans available at each site. As with all picnicking, watch out for ants. Camping  The following campsites are located within the boundaries of the Timucuan Preserve and are operated by state and local agencies: Little Talbot Island State Park 904.251.2320 Huguenot Memorial Park 904.251.3335",
