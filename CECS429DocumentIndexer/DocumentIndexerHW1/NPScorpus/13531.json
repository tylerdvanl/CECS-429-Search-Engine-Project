Volunteers enhance Rock Creek Park by assisting in many areas of park operations. They help protect natural and cultural resources by removing trash from park lands and streams, by removing invasive, nonnative plant species, and by maintaining the park's 32-mile trail system. Volunteers enrich the experience of park visitors by providing information and interpretation at locations throughout Rock Creek Park, including Peirce Mill, the Nature Center, and the Old Stone House.          8th Annual Extreme Cleanup Despite the rain, Rock Creek Park’s eighth annual Extreme Cleanup saw a strong turnout on Saturday, April 23, as 753 volunteers helped clean up trash at more than 75 locations along the 33-mile length of Rock Creek in both Montgomery County, Maryland and Washington, D.C. The Extreme Cleanup is part of the Alice Ferguson Foundation’s annual Potomac River Watershed Cleanup. Each year for this event, Rock Creek Park partners with the Rock Creek Conservancy to collect trash at clean-up sites along Rock Creek and its tributaries within Washington, D.C. The volunteers focused on 22 sites within the national park, netting 1840 volunteer hours. They collected 315 trash bags and 197 recycle bags. The Extreme Cleanup celebrates Earth Day and National Park Week to inspires communities to connect with and take care of their neighborhood national park.      2015 Hartzog Award Winner: Dumbarton Oaks Park Conservancy The Dumbarton Oaks Park Conservancy (DOPC) is the recipient of the National Park Service National Capital Regional Hartzog Volunteer Group Award for 2015! The 30,000 volunteer work hours they've put in over the last 3 years have transformed Dumbarton Oaks Park, and they continue to help us restore this beautiful landscape to its historic glory. The annual Hartzog awards recognize volunteers who made exceptional contributions to national parks. We're fortunate to have dedicated partners like DOPC to help us achieve our mission of protecting resources and connecting with visitors. See the official news release and attached photo of volunteers hard at work on Clifton Walk on last year's National Public Lands Day. Please join us in congratulating Dumbarton Oaks Park Conservancy on their well-earned award!       Current Volunteer Opportunities       For more information about Rock Creek Park's volunteer program, contact the volunteer coordinator.",
