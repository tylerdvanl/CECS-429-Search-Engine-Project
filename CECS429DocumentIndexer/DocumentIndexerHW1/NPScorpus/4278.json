Seagrasses Seagrasses form important ecosystems in all coastal areas of the world except Antarctica. Seagrass ecosystems are highly productive, and support high levels of biodiversity. They provide nursery habitat for small fishes and invertebrates, and food for a wide variety of animals.  They also stabilize sediments, and help maintain water clarity by trapping sediment particles.  Biscayne National Park contains extensive seagrass beds throughout the bay and on the reef tract. Most of the Biscayne’s recreationally and commercially important fishes, crustaceans, and shellfish spend a portion of their lives in seagrass habitat. Three species of seagrasses are commonly found in the Park.  Turtle grass (Thalassia testudinum) has wide leaf blades and a deep root structure, and forms most of the large, lush seagrass meadows found in the park. Sea turtles and some fish like parrotfish feed on turtle grass.  Manatee grass (Syringodium filiforme) is recognized easily because of its cylindrical leaves. Like its name suggests, manatees feed on this type of seagrass. Shoal grass, Halodule wrightii, is an early colonizer of disturbed areas and usually grows in very shallow water. The leaves are generally smaller than the other two species. Two other species of seagrasses have been documented in Biscayne National Park: star grass (Halophila englemanni) and paddle grass (Halophila decipiens).   In addition to seagrass species, numerous species of macroalgae can be found in marine habitats throughout Biscayne National Park. Macroalgal species are often termed 'marine plants', however these species are non-vascular precursors to true plants. Although not exhaustive, the following list presents some of the more commonly observed species of macroalgae. Very few species of marine macroalgae have widely recognized common names, so only scientific names are provided. Acanthophora spicifera Acetabularia calyculus Acetabularia crenulata Acetabularia schenckii Amphiroa compressa Anadyomene stellata Batophora occidentalis Batophora oerstedii Caulerpa lanuginosa Caulerpa mexicana Caulerpa paspaloides Caulerpa prolifera Caulerpa racemosa Caulerpa sertularioides Chondria baileyana Cladosiphon occidentalis Digenea simplex Halimeda copiosa Halimeda goreaui Halimeda incrassata Halimeda monile Halimeda tuna Laurencia gemmifera Laurencia intricata Laurencia poitei Lobophora variegata Neogoniolithon spectabile Neomeris annulata Penicillus capitatus Penicillus dumetosus Penicillus pyriformis Porolithon pachydermum Rhipocephalus phoenix Sargassum fluitans Sargassum natans Sargassum pteropleuron Spyridia filamentosa Stypopodium zonale Udotea conglutinata Udotea dixonii Udotea flabellum Ventricaria ventricosa Wrangelia penicillata        Seagrass epiphytes colonize seagrass leaves and are an important food source.   Seagrass Epiphytes Seagrass leaves are colonized by tiny organisms called epiphytes. Seagrass epiphytes are extremely diverse and include microalgae, macroalgae, bacteria, byrozoans, fungi, sponges, hydroids, crustaceans, and molluscs. Algal epiphytes are photosyntetic and contribute to the primary production of the ecosystem. Most of the larger fish and invertebrate consumers in seagrass ecosystem feed on seagrass epiphytes. Few organisms feed directly on seagrass leaves.",
