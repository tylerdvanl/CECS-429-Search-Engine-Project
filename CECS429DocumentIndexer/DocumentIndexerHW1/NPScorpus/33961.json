    "body": "Virtual Tour Stop, McCoull House Site        Near the center of the Muleshoe stood the McCoull House. This 1 1\/2 story structure was the home of the Neil McCoull family. It was built by 1846.         Four \"Lee to the Rear\" incidents occurred during the war, all within a six day period. After the first occurred on May 6 at the Wilderness, three more happened near the McCoull House at Spotsylvania. Of these, the first occurred in repulsing Upton's attack on May 10 and the last two in the Confederate counterattack on May 12.         The McCoull House sustained heavy damage during the battle. Afterwards, it was repaired and reoccupied. Fire destroyed the house in 1921. Only the outline of the house remains today.         During the Confederate counterattack on the west face of the Muleshoe, Ramseur's North Carolina brigade pulled out of line. The Tarheels moved behind fellow North Carolinians of Junius Daniels's Brigade and formed in the field west of the McCoull House. They made a bayonet charge to recapture a portion of the works. General Ramseur was wounded and the brigade may have suffered over 50% losses in the fighting.This monument to Ramseur's Brigade was dedicated in September, 2001.          East face of salient, tour stop #6 on driving tour of battlefield.
