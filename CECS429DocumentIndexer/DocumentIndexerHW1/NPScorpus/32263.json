    "body": "Then and Now       by Zach Schierl Originally posted as a blog entry on October 18, 2011 Having amassed well over a thousand photographs of Whitman Mission since starting this blog last year, I recently found myself wondering about the many park photographers that no doubt came before me. Drawing inspiration from a display of historic park photographs in the Visitor Center, Museum Tech David Borges and I went into the archives and found several shots of the park from its early years that I decided to replicate in order to see how the landscape of the park has changed over the decades. While we unfortunately don't know exactly when many of these shots were captured, we do know that the photos of the Great Grave and the millpond were taken sometime before 1963, while the picture of the new Visitor Center was taken after its completion in 1963. Have a look at the three before and after photos below and see for yourself how Whitman Mission continues to evolve to this day!       The Great Grave: then (left) and now (right).
