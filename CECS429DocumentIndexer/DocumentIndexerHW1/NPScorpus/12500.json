It's fun and healthy to play in the parks and now National Park Junior Rangers get an extra reward for \"moving it outside.\" Redwood National & State Parks is proud to be selected as one of 20 national parks kicking off Let's Move Outside Junior Ranger programs. Young people who complete at least one physical activity in pursuit of their Junior Ranger badge receive a special sticker that designates them as a Let's Move Outside Junior Ranger. Stickers may be earned by joining one of the parks' Ranger-led Junior Ranger programs offered in campgrounds, or hiking one of the many park trails with their family. A day of hiking is not only great exercise, but also an incredibly fun way to see and learn about the parks.
