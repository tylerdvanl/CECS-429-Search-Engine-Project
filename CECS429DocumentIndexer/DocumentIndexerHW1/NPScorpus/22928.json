Teachers spend the summer working as Park Rangers-learning and performing various tasks depending on their interest and the needs of the park that focus on education programs of the NPS.   TRT's spend most of their time engaging with park education projects, learning about park resources, and developing lesson plans to use in their classrooms and in the park with students.  Their experience will also include exposure to a variety of work performed in National Park units by employees from many career fields. The TRT program is an 8-week program from May through August (dates can be tailored for each TRT). All teachers receive a uniform and stipend for participating in the program. Teachers must complete coursework to receive stipend.  Â      NPS Photo  The 2016 TRT will focus on developing educational resources, including at least one complete lesson plan (pre-site, on-site, post-site, and a distance learning component). The 2016 TRT will also help us complete our lesson plans for a new NPS initiative, Every Kid in a Park (4th grade). 2016 TRT Application is due March 4th, 2016.
