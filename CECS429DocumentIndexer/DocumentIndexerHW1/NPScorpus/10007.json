    "body": "Amphibians         Southern toad (Bufo terrestris) NPS  Amphibians spend part of their lives in the water and part on land. They are ectothermic, which means they can not regulate their own body temperature so many amphibians hibernate in the winter. Amphibians breathe with gills, lungs, the skin, lining of the mouth or a combinations of these things. They tend to live in moist places or near water to keep their soft skin from drying out. Some species of amphibians have poison producing glands in their skin to make them taste bad to any predator that tries to eat them. Gulf Islands National Seashore is home to many amphibians.  They are often found in the moist areas by marshes and ponds. The most common amphibians at Gulf Islands are cricket frogs, narrow mouthed frogs, and squirrel tree frogs.",
