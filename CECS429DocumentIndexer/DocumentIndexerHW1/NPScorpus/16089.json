    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility             Accessibility         Many sites along the Oregon National Historic Trail have outdoor features to view landmarks and interpretive signage. Accessibility varies from site to site. Contact the landowner directly for details.   Accessibility varies greatly along the Oregon National Historic Trail. Each site and landowner varies in the level of services. We have developed an Auto Tour Route to follow the trail via major highways and many segments of the trail can be viewed by automobile. Some sites may provide accessible trails or pathways for touring an area. A variety of visitor centers along the trail provide video and audio programs, and occasionally tactile or interactive exhibits. Learn more about sites along the trail on our Places to Go page. For sight impaired visitors we provide our official map and guide in large font format on our Publications page.",
