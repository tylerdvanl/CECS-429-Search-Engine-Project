Teachers selected as teacher-rangers spend the summer performing various duties depending on their interests and the needs of the park. The Teacher-Ranger-Teacher program allows parks to reach teachers and students who have had little or no experience with a national park setting and provides opportunities to explore the relevance that National Park Service sites can have in their lives.   Manhattan Project NHP Teacher-Ranger-Teacher Program Teachers selected as a Teacher-Ranger-Teacher spend six weeks working side-by-side with park rangers performing various duties such as developing and presenting interpretive programs for the general public, staffing the visitor center desk, reviewing existing or developing new curriculum-based education materials, or undertaking special projects. The Teacher-Ranger-Teacher program provides a stipend and professional development credits.    Once they return to their schools, teacher-rangers bring their park knowledge and experiences into the school and classrooms throughout the school year to engage students, faculty, and staff in lessons and activities that relate to Manhattan Project NHP and other National Park Service sites.
