Maples, oaks, tulip poplars, Virginia pines, sweet gum, sassafras, persimmon and many other trees create the canopy of the park. Down below, the floor is scattered with blueberries, huckleberries, azaleas, spicebush, ferns, and mountain laurels. In late spring (May-June) Mountain Laurels are in full bloom and perfect time to get out and see the plants that are waking from their winter slumber.    Â      Wild Turkeys on the Garden Trail Kevin F Barry  Dawn and dusk are great times to catch a glimpse of animals that make their home in the Park. Some of the animals that might be found while walking the trails are Whitetail deer, Possums, Black Snakes, Eastern Box turtle, Wild turkeys, Pileated Woodpecker, and Red-shouldered Hawks. Red and Grey foxes are also present but due to their reclusive nature they are a bit more difficult to spot. Keep your eyes open because there are also many other species of mammals, birds and reptiles that reside in Fort Dupont.",
