    "body": "Weather Data - Lovell Wyoming Area       The southern part of the park is a few miles east of Lovell, Wyoming. This area is one of the northern most example of a Great Basin Desert in the United States.  The elevation is just above 3,600 feet. The high temperatures, high winds, and less than 6 inches of precipitation put it firmly in the desert category. Weather can be quite extreme. In the summer expect highs over 100. Because of these temperatures severe dehydration and sunburn can be a problem. In the winter, temperatures can be brutally cold with lows reaching -20 and even lower at times.  The most moderate conditions can be found in the spring (late April to early June) or fall (mid-September to early November). Even during these times the weather can quickly change. High winds are a constant issue.
