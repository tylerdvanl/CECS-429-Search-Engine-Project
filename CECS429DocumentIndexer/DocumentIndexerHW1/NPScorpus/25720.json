You can fish right from shore in Seward and opportunities abound for freshwater fishing in the lakes and streams in nearby Chugach National Forest. State fishing licenses are required. Fishing charters are available year-round. For more information on licenses or fishing regulations visit the Alaska Department of Fish and Game website.",
