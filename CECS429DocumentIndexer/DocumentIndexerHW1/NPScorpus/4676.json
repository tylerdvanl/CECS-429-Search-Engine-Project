These majestic trees are now 150-220 years old and some are at least 120 feet tall.  These tulip trees can be seen along Jockey Hollow Road and on the Grand Loop Trail in the Jockey Hollow Unit of the park.  Large specimen trees such as Silver Maple and Chinese Sequoia can be found on the grounds of the Cross Estate in the New Jersey Brigade Unit of the park.  A self-guided walk through the grounds of the Cross Estate provides visitors with the opportunity to view historic trees and learn about their importance to Native Americans and colonists.",
