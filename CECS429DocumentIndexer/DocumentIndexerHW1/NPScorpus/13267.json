Individual patch size and density limits for herbicide use, which limited ability to treat infestations while they are still small were removed. Also, methods were refined for treating invasive species in sensitive areas such as traditional gathering areas, near water, and in designated wilderness. The IPMP Update was available for public review from December 15, 2010 through January 30, 2011. Public comments and NPS responses are documented in the Invasive Plant Management Plan Update Plan Public Comment and Response Report. Clarifications, corrections and changes made to the IPMP Update following its release and public review are described in the Errata Sheets. The documents mentioned here are available electronically through the National Park Service’s Planning, Environment, and Public Comment system (PEPC) at http:\/\/parkplanning.nps.gov\/projectHome.cfm?parkID=347&projectId=23812.
