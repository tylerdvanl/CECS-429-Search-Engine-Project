Over the last century, these factors have interacted in different ways to shape the character of the plant communities at the park.  In some cases, this has transformed the vegetation patterns from what they were during the lifetime of Augustus Saint-Gaudens; in other cases, the forest cover has either remained very much as it was or has reverted to a state resembling the historic past.",
