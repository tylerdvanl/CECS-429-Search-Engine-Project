The ten miles of trails at Friendship Hill National Historic Site offer a glimpse of the natural world of the Allegheny Plateau. When Albert Gallatin first came to the area in 1784, the Monongahela River was on the edge of the American frontier.  Gallatin believed the rich land of the west held the key to his wealth. Farming, logging, mining, and the development of transportation have all left their imprint here. Now the land is being managed to return to woods and meadows similar to those Gallatin knew, and you are invited to explore them.",
