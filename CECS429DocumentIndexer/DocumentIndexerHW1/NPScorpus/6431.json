    "body": "Homesteading Legacies           First Homesteader, Daniel Freeman Banner HNM Image  The Homestead Act became the law of the land on January 1, 1863. it remained in effect until 1976, when the Federal Land Policy and Management Act repealed it (though a ten year extension through 1986 was authorized in Alaska). Over the entire 124-year history of the Homestead Act, four million people filed for 160-acre parcels of the public domain. Of these four million, about 1.6 million (approximately 40 percent) were successful, fulfilling all the requirements of the government and earning the title to their property. Every single one of these four million, regardless of success or failure, had a personal story. Homestead National Monument of America exists today to tell those stories and commemorate the accomplishments and memories of all homesteaders. The Monument is currently involved in a project to identify well-known figures in American history that have or had personal connections to the Homestead Act. Some of those identified thus far include: Willa Cather (author); George Washington Carver (scientist, educator); Virgil Earp (frontier lawman); Jeannette Rankin (first woman elected to congress); Laura Ingalls Wilder (author); and Lawrence Welk (entertainer). Each of these people was touched by the Homestead Act and made significant contributions to the world in which he or she lived. Through a generous grant from the Gage County Foundation, Banners have been produced featuring each of these individuals. The banners hang outside the Education Center at the Monument.  Links to the stories of some prominent descendents of homesteaders can be found below. If you are a descendant of someone who filed on a homestead you story is important too, go here to learn more about telling your story.          Rachel Bella Calof HMN Image  Rachel Bella Calof Yiddish Autobiographer, Homesteader 1876-1952 Devils Lake, North Dakota          George Washington Carver HNM Image  George Washington Carver Inventor, Educator, Homesteader 1865(?)-1943 Beeler, Kansas          Willa Cather HNM Image  Willa Cather Author, Pulitzer Prize Winner, Daughter of Homesteaders 1873-1947 Red Cloud, Nebraska          Kenneth Deardorff Hnm Image  Kenneth Deardorff Farmer, Busness Owner, Carpenter, Fur Trapper, Vietnam Veteran, Homesteader 1944 - Stony River, Alaska          Ivan Doig HNM Image  Ivan Doig Ranch hand, Novelist, Historian, Grandson of Homesteaders 1939- Broadwater County, Montana          Virgil Earp HNM Image  Virgil Earp Wells Fargo Shotgun Guard, Deputy Marshall-Shootout at the OK Corral, homesteader 1844-1905 Prescott, Arizona          Whoopi Goldberg HNM Image  Whoopi Goldberg Comedian, Actress, Winner of Grammy, Tony, Emmy, and Academy Awards Great-Great-Granddaughter of Homesteaders 1955- Alachua County Florida        Amy Heidemann HNM Image  Amy Heidemann Member of the band Karmin, Singer, Songwriter, Musician, Great-Great Granddaughter of Homesteaders 1986 - Seward, Nebraska          John Hubbell HNM Image  John Hubbell Trader with the Navajo Indians (Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site), Homesteader 1853-1930 Gando, Arizona        Chet Huntley HNM Image  Chet Huntley Radio Announcer, Journalist, Newscaster (The Huntley-Brinkley Report, NBC News), Resort Developer, Son of Homesteaders 1911-1974 Cardwell, Montana          Jewel Kilcher HNM Image  Jewel Kilcher Musician, Author, Actress, Granddaughter of Homesteaders 1974- Homer, Alaska          Thomas Kleppe HNM Image  Thomas Kleppe Mayor, Member of Congress, Director of Small Busness Administration, Secretary of the Interior (Ford Administration), Son of Homesteaders 1919- 2007 Kintyre, North Dakota          Walter Knott HNM Image  Walter Knott Farmer, Agricultural Developer, Restaurateur, Theme Park Innovator, Homesteader 1889 - 1981 Buena Park, California          William McKnight HNM Image  William McKnight Businessman, Industrialist, Head of 3M corporation, Son of Homesteaders 1887 - 1978 White, South Dakota          Enos Mills HNM Image  Enos Mills  Naturalist, Father of Rocky Mountain National Park, Homesteader 1870-1922 Estes Park, Colorado          Forest Ray Moulton HNM Image  Forest Ray Moulton Astronomer, Mathematician, Son of Homesteaders 1872-1952 LeRoy, Michigan          Bill Nelson HNM Image  Bill Nelson State Legislator, State Insurance Commissioner, U.S. Congressman, U.S. Senator, Astronaut, Grandson of Homesteaders 1942- Brevard County, Florida          Al Neuharth HNM image  Al Neuharth Businessman, author, and founder of USA Today, The Freedom Forum, and the Newseum, Grandson of Homesteaders 1924-2013 Eureka, South Dakota          Tom Osborne HNM Image  Tom Osborne Educator, College Football Coach (University of Nebraska), U.
