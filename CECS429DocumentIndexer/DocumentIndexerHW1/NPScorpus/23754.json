Photo by Sally King  The Main Loop Trail is a 1.2 mile loop trail (thanks to log crossings) through archeological sites. Most visitors spend between 45 minutes and one hour on this trail. Ladders along the trail allow visitors to climb into cavates (small human-carved alcoves). The Main Loop Trail takes you past the Big Kiva, Tyuonyi, Talus House, and Long House.  Pick up a $1 trail guide at the Visitor Center to learn more about the sites along the trail through descriptions of 21 numbered stops.  The first section of this trail is accessible to wheelchairs and strollers; however, the second part contains areas with numerous narrow stone stairways. In winter, this is the only trail on which the snow is removed. Map of Main Loop Trail (PDF)         The Main Loop Trail may be closed for a short while after a winter snow while staff clears trails. Photo by Sally King  WINTER CLOSURE The morning after a winter snow this trail may be closed for a few hours while staff remove the snow from the trail. A trail closure will be indicated by a sign at the start of the trail. Please obey closure signs. Walking on the snowy trail leaves dangerous ice that can remain for months. Check at the visitor center for details.       Don't forget to pick up a trail guide at the visitor center for $1.  They provide valuable information about trail highlights.
