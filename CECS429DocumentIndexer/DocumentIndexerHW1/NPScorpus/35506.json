    "body": "Sustainability in the Community          Â    Zion National Park's commitment to sustainability extends beyond its borders. We believe that working with the natural surroundings works best when you also work with the surrounding communities as well.   Springdale, the park's gateway community, has made significant efforts to become a green community. In addition to being active participants on the Zion Canyon Green Team, Springdale residents have established a successful recycling program, are active proponents of renewable energy sources, and are proud sponsors of the successful Earth Day and Arbor Day celebrations each year. For more information please visit Springdale's Official \"Going Green\" Website. Furthermore, Zion National Park has the good fortune of partnering with Xanterra, one of the \"greenest\" of park concessionaires, which is in the vanguard of environmentally friendly businesses. Xanterra operates the Zion Lodge. Everything from organic food, composting food scraps, nontoxic cleaning agents, and cabins retrofitted for energy efficiency can be found at Zion Lodge. For more information please visit Xanterra's Website. As individuals and families, you can make a difference by following the tips listed on the Climate Friendly Parks Website.",
