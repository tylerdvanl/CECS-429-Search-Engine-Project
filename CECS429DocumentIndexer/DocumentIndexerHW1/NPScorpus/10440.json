    "body": "Explore This Park    Learn About the Park     Management             Management       Saint Croix Island International Historic Site was established as a national monument on June 8, 1949. The site received its current designation on September 25, 1984. The management of Saint Croix Island International Historic Site is driven by its mission, which was spelled out in the 1998 General Management Plan:  The National Park Service preserves Saint Croix Island IHS as a monument to the beginning of the United States and Canada. It was here that Pierre Dugua Sieur de Mons with his company of 78 men established a French settlement in 1604-05. In cooperation with Parks Canada, the National Park Service educates the public about that heroic effort, its context, and its consequences.  This section of the website will refer you to many of the documents that help the National Park Service accomplish that mission for inspiration of this and future generations.      2008 Accomplishments Wondering what happened in the park last year?
