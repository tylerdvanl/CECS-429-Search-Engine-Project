The 161 mile Taylor Highway begins at Tetlin Junction on the Alaska Highway. It ends on the banks of the Yukon River, 12 miles upstream from the preserve, in the historic town of Eagle, Alaska. The mostly gravel road is usually open from mid-April to mid-October and is suitable for cars, trucks, and small RV's. The Steese Highway begins in Fairbanks and travels 162 miles to Circle, Alaska, 14 miles downstream of the preserve boundary. It is also mostly gravel, but is open year round, depending upon snow and drifting conditions in winter months. From Eagle, visitors can enjoy a leisurely float down the majestic Yukon River to access the preserve. Visitors arriving in Circle can gain access to the preserve by motoring 14 miles up the Yukon River in a powerboat. Another option is to charter an air taxi from Fairbanks or Tok and fly into the headwaters of the Charley River to challenge yourself on the rapids of this National Wild River.  Check locally about road conditions before beginning your journey and always remember to bring sufficient emergency supplies with you. It is recommended that you carry water, food, warm clothing, and two spare tires, as these are commonly used emergency items on both the Taylor and Steese Highways. Road condition reports are available and updated regularly.   Â     NPS\/Greg Kinman",
