    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit           Plan Your Visit       People visit Yellowstone and discover an amazing variety of experiences and destinations. We hope you'll have fun, make lifelong memories, and enjoy this special place.  Top Things To Know   Pack your patience: hundreds of thousands of people visit Yellowstone during the months of June, July, and August. It's also a big place, and winding roads and traffic often make drive times much longer than people expect.  Practice safe selfie: do not approach animals to take pictures. Early birds avoid crowds and traffic: visit the park during nonpeak hours (before 9 am and after 3 pm) and seasons (April and May, September and October). Check out our list of seasonal highlights.  Plan ahead: campgrounds and lodges fill early, so finding a place to sleep at the last minute is unlikely. Stay on boardwalks: hot springs have injured more people than any other natural feature (including animals).  Drive responsibly: observe posted speed limits and use pullouts to watch wildlife, take pictures, and let other cars pass. Bears inhabit the entire park, not just the backcountry: learn how to travel safely in bear country. Can you hear me now? Cell service and bandwidth are limited: don't be surprised if you can't receive calls or texts. Explore beyond our borders: the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem includes much more than the park.
