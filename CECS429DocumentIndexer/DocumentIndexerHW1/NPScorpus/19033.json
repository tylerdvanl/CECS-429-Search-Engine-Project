Along those miles are physical traces of trail history, such as wagon ruts, graves, inscriptions, and campsites - places that tell about that history, such as museums and visitor interpretive centers. Many such traces and places are found on state lands, in nature preserves, in city parks, on private ranches, and even in suburban back yards.These important pieces of trail history can be publicly commemorated and protected through the National Park Service (NPS) site certification program.As the owner or manager of a certified trail site, segment, museum, or interpretive center located near a congressionally designated National Historic Trail, you can request guidance from NPS experts in many specialities. In addition, all trails partners may apply for Challenge Cost Share Program matching funds to help protect a trail property, make it accessible, research its history, or tell its story.The Acrobat Reader PDF document - How to Certify Your National Historic Trail Property - further explains the program and the process for site certification.      Our Mission To promote the preservation and development of national historic trails for public use, enjoyment, education, and inspiration.      Our Staff & Offices    Laws & Policies",
