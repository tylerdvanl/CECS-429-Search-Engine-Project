As the culmination of the NEPA process, the NPS is making available the Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) assessing four alternatives and identifying the environmentally preferable alternative. However, it should be noted that Section 124 of Public Law 111-88 provides that the Secretary's decision whether to issue this permit is \"notwithstanding any other provision of law.\" As such, the NPS has not identified a preferred alternative in the Final EIS. The Draft EIS was available for public and agency review and comment between September 23, 2011, and December 9, 2011. An electronic copy of the Draft EIS was posted at www.parkplanning.nps.gov\/PORE. Copies of the document were distributed to individuals, agencies, and organizations, and were available in local public libraries, at the public meetings, and upon request. This Final EIS provides responses to substantive agency and public comments, and incorporates those comments and suggested revisions, where necessary.
