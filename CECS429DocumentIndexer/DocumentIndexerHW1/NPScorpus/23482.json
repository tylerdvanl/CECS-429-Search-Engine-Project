    "body": "Archives       The Chaco Archive contains original field records, photographs, slides, and reports for park projects, maps, and manuscripts of Chaco-related archaeological research, and copies of earlier field notes and reports for work done by other institutions. To assist researchers, finding aids are posted to this web site when collections are cataloged. Collections with no finding aids are not yet fully cataloged. The collections below have been grouped into three main categories to facilitate searching: Resource-Related Collections, Photographic Collections, and UNM Chaco Field School Collections.  Â    Resource-Related Collections   Additional Lands Survey Records  Finding Aid (PDF)  This collection contains the records of the Chaco Additions survey, 1983-1984, under the direction of Robert P. Powers. The primary objective of the survey was to carry out a 100% inventory of previously unsurveyed areas added to Chaco Culture National Historical Park in 1980. A total of 6,288 acres, including all of the Kin Klizhin, Kin Bineola, and Chacra Mesa parcels, and a portion of the South Addition were surveyed. A total of 957 sites and 183 isolated occurrences were recorded.

This collection consists of wood documentation forms, architecture recording forms, tree-ring lab data, field notes, drawings\/maps, reports, correspondence, memos and administrative papers. 7.9 LF  Chetro Ketl Painted Wood Records Finding Aid (PDF)  In August 1947, a heavy rainstorm created a new channel that carried water directly into Chetro Ketl, flooding several lower rooms, weakening wall bases, and collapsing a major section of the back wall. The Ruin Stabilization Unit crew, under the direction of R. Gordon Vivian, began emergency work to prevent further wall collapse. In November 1947, work began in Room 93. It was decided to excavate the upper room to relieve the weight on the lower room walls. The excavators ncovered an assemblage of approximately 200 artifacts, mostly fragments of carved and painted wood, in the dry layer about 10 inches above the floor. 1.75 LF  Cultural Resource Records  Assembled collection of records relating to archeological management and research done at the park. Created in 2011 for resource records not associated with existing archival collections (i.e., Chaco Project Records, Chaco Wood Project Records, Rock Art Studies, etc.). The majority of the records are modern (post-1980), but one series contains records of salvage archaeology projects in the 1950s and 60s, and another series contains records of electro-chemical soil testing in the 1960s. Other topics found in this collection include: Historic Structure Reports, the National Geographic Society, partnerships with the University of New Mexico and University of Virginia, desk files of Chaco archaeologists, NAGPRA records, the Vanishing Treasures initiative, compliance files, permitted research files, and administrative records and correspondence related to the management of cultural resources.
