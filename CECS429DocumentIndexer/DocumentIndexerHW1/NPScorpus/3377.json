    "body": "Fees & Reservations       Fees:  There are no fees to enter the park or to take the ferry to the fort. The 36-passenger ferry operates with a Boarding Pass system. The passes are issued from the Fort Matanzas Visitor Center (not the St. Augustine city Visitor Center) on a  first come, first served basis. Family members of all ages must have a pass to board the ferry.  St. Johns County, which maintains a beach ramp directly across Highway A1A from the park entrance, charges a fee to drive onto the ocean beach from mid-March through September.  School Group Reservations:  School and other groups are welcome. Times for School group tours are 9:45, 10:45, 11:45, 1:45, and 2:45 daily with no more than 36 people at each time. Not to be confused with the public tours which depart at half-past the hour. Please call the park at 904 471-0116 to make a reservation. For more information see the \"For Teachers\" page.",
