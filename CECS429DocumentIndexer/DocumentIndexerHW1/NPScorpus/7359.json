    "body": "Beaver Pond Nature Trail       Begin hiking at the west end of the sidewalk at the Afterbay Contact Station. Travel across the yucca flats to the ridge above Lime Kiln Creek. Below the creek is littered with gnawed trees and other building materials. This is one construction sight you will want to take a closer look at.  The trail begins to wind down the steep hill side to the bottom where you can sit among the beaver ponds and marvel at their ingenuity.",
