    "body": "East and South Barracks Transfer        NPS Photo   Â    In 2012, the U.S. Army Reserve will vacate and relinquish all lands and structures within the East and South Vancouver Barracks to the National Park Service.  In preparation for this transfer, a long-term vision and master plan must be established for this area that respond to the planning framework already established for Fort Vancouver National Historic Site. The park has established a Project Website through the National Park Service's Planning, Environment and Public Comment (PEPC) program where you can find the latest planning information, including:  East & South Barracks Draft Master Plan and Environmental Assessment Newsletter on Publication of East & South Vancouver Barracks Draft Master Plan and Environmental Assessment Public Scoping Report   Over the years, there have been other plans, such as the Cooperative Management Plan (2000), General Management Plan (2003), Long-Range Interpretive Plan (2004) and the Historic Reserve Cultural Landscape Report (2005), that have established direction for the future rehabilitation, resource preservation, and public use of the East and South Vancouver Barracks.  Building on this guidance, the East and South Barracks Master Plan will establish a more focused direction for this area and will lay the groundwork for future site design and development. Presently, we are continuing work on the East and South Vancouver Barracks Master Plan. We will prepare an environmental assessment (EA) as part of this effort. Scheduled for completion in 2012, this master plan will establish clear direction for the rehabilitation and public use of the East and South Barracks after the U.S. Army Reserve transfers them to the National Park Service.
