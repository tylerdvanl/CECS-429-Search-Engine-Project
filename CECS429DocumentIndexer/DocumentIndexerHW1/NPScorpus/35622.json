Under favorable conditions, the 16-mile route takes an average of 12 hours. Even for well-conditioned hikers, this makes for a long and strenuous day. Permits are not issued when the flow is 120 cubic feet per second (cfs) or greater. Because the trailhead at Chamberlain's Ranch is a 1.5-hour drive from the Temple of Sinawava, either two vehicles or a shuttle is necessary. A wilderness permit is required. Group size limits apply.  Overnight Hike from Top to Bottom To enjoy The Narrows at a more leisurely pace, some visitors choose to spend a night in the gorge. There are twelve numbered sites. Only one-night stays are allowed, and overnight trips must start from Chamberlain's Ranch. Reservations are recommended for weekend trips. Campsite capacity is limited and only two sites can accommodate groups of more than six people. Permits are not issued when the flow is 120 cubic feet per second (cfs) or greater.
