Some folks volunteer in the winter for ski trail condition reporting and visitor contact.          What Do Volunteers Do?

Your contribution depends on the type of work and the time you have to offer. Scout groups often complete one or two day work projects as they hike the lakeshore's segment of the North Country National Scenic Trail. Organized volunteer trail crews from universities or other organizations normally work a week or more in the park.  Campground hosts are asked to sign up for a minimum four week stay. Student Conservation Association aides generally stay for about two months.   Volunteers are provided a VIP uniform and protective gear if required.  A small stipend may be available to reimburse for travel and food expenses. Housing may be available for long-term volunteers.  Most volunteers work an eight hour day.  Please refer to the VIP recruiting site bulletin for more information.       How Do I Become A VIP?
