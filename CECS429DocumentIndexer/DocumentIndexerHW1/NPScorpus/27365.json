Like all National Park units, Minuteman Missile makes a concerted effort to connect with future generations and cultivate an ethic of stewardship among youth and young adults.  Youth Partnership Program at Minuteman Missile Teens are hired through the Youth Partnership Program (YPP) for the summer season as Park Guides at Minuteman Missile. The announcement for the jobs comes after (and if) the park receives a grant for the program. YPP participants work in the park's Division of Interpretation & Education. This work allows teens to get first hand experience with the National Park Service (NPS), while learning about the NPS mission of protection and preservation of America's greatest natural and cultural resources.   The Youth Partnership Program also allows Minuteman Missile to create a shared sense of stewardship among teens and helps diversify the park's workforce. YPP is one of many Youth Programs that the NPS has created to expose youth and young adults with employment and educational opportunities in public land management and develop the next generation of conservation leaders.

Working with the park on projects is a great way for teens to learn about park resources, the history of the Cold War and the role of nuclear deterrence in American military strategy.",
