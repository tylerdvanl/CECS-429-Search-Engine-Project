NPS photo      Anchialine pools found near the shoreline are a very important habitat for some very cool critters.  Although these pools appear to have no direct connection with the ocean, their hydrologic connection to ground water and the sea can be seen as pool water levels rise and fall with ocean tides.  A small yet distinctive number of species inhabit the pools, including crustaceans, mollusks and the 'opae'ula, a small endemic species of red shrimp.",
