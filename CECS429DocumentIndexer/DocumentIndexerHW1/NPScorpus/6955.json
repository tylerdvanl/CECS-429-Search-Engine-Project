    "body": "Cooperating Association       Theodore Roosevelt Nature and History Association The Theodore Roosevelt Nature and History Association was organized in 1951 by a group of park enthusiasts to promote and support the historical, scientific and educational activities of Theodore Roosevelt National Park. This commitment has broadened to offer support to Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site and Upper Souris National Wildlife Refuge. The Association is a non-federal, nonprofit organization governed by a volunteer board of directors. To accomplish its goals, the Association is authorized by the National Park Service to sell publications, maps, interpretive learning tools, and theme-related items in park bookstores. From its inception, the Association has donated more than $750,000 from the sale of these materials to the National Park Service and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service areas in North Dakota.",
