Their work transcends maintenance. It involves new thought and new action to enhance and enrich...the past...We cannot rest on the achievements of the past. Rather each generation must not only be stewards, but activists, innovators, and enrichers.\" Laurance RockefellerThe history of Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park is not only the history of a special house and property and the families who lived there.
