Insects, spiders, and other arthropods are present in healthy numbers throughout the park. One exception may be aquatic insect species adversely affected by industrial and residential runoff. Valley Creek passes through over 20 miles of developed land before reaching the park border, and nature pays the price as the water absorbs waste materials. Otherwise, amateur and expert entomologists alike will find countless species of butterflies, beetles, spiders, centipedes, and more to occupy their time. Insects are the most numerous life forms in the animal kingdom, and Valley Forge is no exception. Don’t be alarmed, however. If bugs are not your cup of tea, you won’t be overwhelmed by any swarms. In fact, you will probably only see a few passing butterflies unless you go looking for more.  In the mid-1990s, Jane Ruffin conducted a butterfly survey in the park and documented a great diversity of butterflies.
