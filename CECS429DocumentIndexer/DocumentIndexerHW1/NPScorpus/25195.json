This recovery and succession process is of great interest to scientists concerned with after-effects of volcanic eruptions. Important initial observations were recorded by Father Hubbard the year before the 1931 eruption. In recent years scientists have conducted baseline biological surveys of the caldera as a measure for future changes. Interest among scientists helped spur Aniakchak caldera's designation as a national natural landmark in 1970.",
