However, the courts have recognized that activities associated with the exercise of these rights may be reasonably regulated to protect park resources. The necessity of a permit to conduct First Amendment activities is determined by the group size.  A small group is defined as “25 people or less.” A small group is not required to obtain a First Amendment Permit if they are located within a park designated First Amendment site and have no more than leaflets, booklets and\/or hand held signs. A permit is required for any small group that:  wants to hold a demonstration or distribute and\/or sell printed matter somewhere outside a designated First Amendment area wants to use equipment (i.e. tables, banners, platforms, etc.) even if it is within a designated area  is merely an extension of another group already availing itself of the 25 person maximum  wants to guarantee they will have priority for the use of a location, including the designated First Amendment areas  A large group is defined as “more than 25 people” and is required to obtain a First Amendment Permit even if they are utilizing a park designated First Amendment site.
