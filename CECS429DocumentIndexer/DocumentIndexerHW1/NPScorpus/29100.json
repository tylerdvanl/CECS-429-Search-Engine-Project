    "body": "Mineral Springs        Historic postcard image of Hillside Springs, 1920s. NPS\/Chickasaw National Recreation Area   Â    There are a number of cold-water mineral springs in the park which give rise to sulphur, bromide, and iron-bearing waters. Most of these are enclosed in pavilions or pools constructed of native stone and shaded by groves of large, old trees which present a pleasant and comfortable setting for the use and enjoyment of the springs. The central portion of the Platt Historic District near Highway 177 contains the most significant sulphur springs at Hillside Spring, Pavilion Spring, and Black Sulphur Spring. In addition, Flower Park contains pools of sulphur water (flowing from the Vendome Well) and mud which historically had some therapeutic qualities attributed to it. The major bromide springs are Medicine Spring and Bromide Spring, both of which are located in the western portion of the park and, appropriately enough, rise from the base of Bromide Hill Unlike Hot Springs National Park, in Arkansas, which in the past maintained facilities for various mineral water therapies, the Platt Historic District never hosted a publicly owned bathouse. The National Park Service makes available and maintains the various springs for all visitors and indicates their mineral composition, but makes no claim regarding their medicinal or therapeutic values.",
