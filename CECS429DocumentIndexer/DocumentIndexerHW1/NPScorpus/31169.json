    "body": "Field Trips       Plan Ahead Field trips to the park are free of charge. Because demand for field trips is high at certain times of the year, all field trips must be scheduled at least four weeks in advance. Field trips and programs are available on a first-come, first-served basis. For more information or to schedule a program, please email us or call (956) 541-2785, ext. 324. Things to Know Field trips are designed to accommodate up to 100 students and generally take 1 to 1 Â½ hours to complete. These programs can be modified to fit into shorter time frames if necessary. Most field trip activities are outdoors and dependent on weather conditions. The park regularly updates and adds to its field trip offerings. Contact us to discuss current program offerings. Self-guided Field Trip A self-guided program is a great way for school groups to explore the park. This is a good option for groups who are short on time or who wish to view the site at their own pace. Reservations are not required for self-guided field trips but we do ask you call in advance to inform us of your visit. Park brochures and trail maps are available at the visitor center. Learning Process The park continues to develop program offerings in an effort to engage youth. With the acquisition and development of the Resaca de la Palma Battlefield unit, educational opportunities at both sites will increase. The park encourages schools and educators to experience programs at the park and help us mentor the next generation of national park stewards.      Results  There are no results to show.",
