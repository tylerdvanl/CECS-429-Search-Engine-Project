Such forces of change are completely natural and often necessary. Plants and animals have evolved with, and many depend on, the role fire plays in creating and maintaining a diversity of habitats. Resource managers at Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area follow a comprehensive fire plan that allows the restoration of fire regimes through a full range of management tools. Natural fire, prescribed fire, hazardous fuel reduction, and fire effects monitoring help restore natural processes while providing for firefighter and public safety. Forging The Landscape The Park has 5 different climate zones in and around the 71 mile long Bighorn Lake. These include high desert, sagebrush steppe with mixed grass prairie, mountain terrain with open meadows, and ponderosa pine forests. Fire played the dominant role in maintaining these zones.

Mission: The National Park Service manages wildland fire to protect the public, communities and infrastructure, conserve natural and cultural resources, and restore and maintain ecological health.",
