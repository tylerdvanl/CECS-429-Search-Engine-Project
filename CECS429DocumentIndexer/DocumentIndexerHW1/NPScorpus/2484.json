NPS Robb Hannawacker           Amphibians are important species that live throughout Grand Canyon National Park. They are predators of many invertebrate and vertebrate species, and are also an important food source for fish, reptiles, mammals, and birds. Amphibians are very sensitive to environmental change, and are some of the first species to go extinct when a habitat is changed. Because of this, studying amphibians can provide important information about the health of the Grand Canyon ecosystem.  Across the world, amphibian species are threatened with extinction and declines in population. Some of the largest threats to amphibians are habitat destruction, poisoning by human chemicals, and introduced species. The protected habitat of the Grand Canyon is an important refuge for these fragile species, where they can continue to exist and thrive. Please observe amphibians from a distance. Amphibians absorb chemicals through their skin, meaning that they can be poisoned by the sunscreen and bug spray on your hands.        Canyon Tree Frog NPS K.Kingsley   Canyon Tree Frog This species is widely-distributed in Arizona outside of the Sonoran and Mohave Deserts.        Northern Leopard Frog AZGFD R.Babb  Northern Leopard Frog  One of the most wide ranging frog species, northern leopard frogs were once common in the Grand Canyon, but have undergone major declines and have not been seen in the Canyon in several years.        Red-Spotted Toad USFWS Jim Rorabaugh  Red-Spotted Toad  This toad is found from southern Nevada to southwestern Kansas, south to Hidalgo, Mexico, and throughout Baja California.           Tiger Salamander NPS Paul Kister  Tiger Salamander  They are also the most wide-ranging salamander species in North America, living throughout most of the United States, southern Canada, and eastern Mexico.        Woodhouse Toad NPS Volunteer  Woodhouse Toad  These toads live throughout Arizona except for in the arid, western deserts. They are especially common near the Indian Gardens and Phantom Ranch Campgrounds.          Quick Facts   8 species of Amphibians live within the park- 4 toad species, 2 frog species, and 2 salamander species. Most reptiles spend their entire lives on land, but amphibians must spend at least part of their life in the water. For example, frogs and toads begin their lives as tadpoles, which live in pools and springs. No amphibians have scales, and many have a moist skin covered with mucous.        More Information Amphibians of Grand Canyon NP Grand Canyon Vertebrate Animal Species List Grand Canyon Threatened & Endangered Species List Arizona Game and Fish",
