Depending on where and when someone is, snakes can be found crossing the trails and roads in the park, and if in the fields, there is a good chance at seeing a 5-lined skink along a fence post. The park has only one venomous snake, the northern copperhead. It is a very unaggressive animal, and will usually flee if not harassed.",
