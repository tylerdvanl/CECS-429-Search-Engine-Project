    "body": "Backcountry Camping        NPS \/ Kim Acker       Backcountry camping is allowed only in the northwest area of the park, outlined in red on the map below. This area, north of Beaver Creek, east of Hwy. 87, south of NPS 5 and west of Highland Creek Trail, holds several different habitats - prairie, forest, and riparian - each with a variety of plants and wildlife. Several marked trails wind through that section of the park. Off-trail hiking is allowed here and throughout the park, as well.       The backcountry camping region in Wind Cave National Park is outlined in red on this map. NPS Map       Are You Ready to Go?    Permits  A free permit is required for all backcountry camping. Permits are issued at the visitor center.    Campsites  All backcountry campsites must be at least 1\/4 mile from and out of sight of any road. Campsites also must be 100 feet (33 meters) away from any trail or water source.     Minimum Impact Camping  Please practice Leave No Trace principles during your visit. Pack out all items you bring in with you.     Water  Carry all the drinking water you will need as there are few water sources in the park. Boil or filter any water obtained in the backcountry.     Fires  Open fires are not allowed. Use self-contained fuel stoves for cooking in the backcountry. Wildfire threat is moderate to extreme most of the year.     Encountering Wildlife  Be aware of your surroundings and wildlife at all times. Bison may appear tame but are unpredictable and may charge without warning.      Resource Protection  Do not disturb or remove plants, wildlife, antlers or bones, or any other cultural or natural feature.     Travel  Pets, bicycles, and motorized equipment are not allowed in the backcountry.",
