    "body": "Prescribed Burn - Wildfires         Wildfire   Wildfires will eventually burn most areas, with fires caused by lightning, an arsonist, or an escaped campfire. If an area has not burned in many years, the unnatural accumulation of thick, sometimes dead vegetation, can result in a very intense, fast-moving conflagration. However, if the area has been treated recently with a prescribed fire to remove excess fuel, the wildfire will be much easier to control and homes will be less threatened.",
