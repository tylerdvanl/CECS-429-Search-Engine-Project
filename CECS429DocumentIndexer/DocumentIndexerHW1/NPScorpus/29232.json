    "body": "Travertine Nature Center              The Travertine Nature Center, located on Travertine Creek near the eastern edge of the Platt Historic District, serves as the park's main educational center. The nature center contains exhibit dioramas, live reptiles, amphibians, and birds of prey, as well as an interactive learning area for visitors of all ages. The Nature Center also contains an information desk and bookstore with books on nature, geology and history, and a variety of interesting nature posters and postcards. A one hundred seat auditorium at the Nature Center provides opportunities for ranger-led nature programs and video presentations on a variety of topics. Exhibits at the Travertine Nature Center highlight: the forest\/prairie ecosystem of Southern Oklahoma; the significant water resources of springs, creeks, and lakes of Chickasaw National Recreation Area; and the diversity of wildlife and plants located in the park. Ranger-led programs are presented daily at the Nature Center in the summer. These programs include hikes to Antelope and Buffalo Springs, night hikes, and a variety of talks associated with the nature and wildlife of the park. The Travertine Nature Center was built in 1969 in the midst of the National Park Service environmental education initiatives (late 1960's and early 1970's). It is built in a unique rock work design, modeled after the style of architect Frank Lloyd Wright. The Nature Center sits on top of Travertine Creek, offering visitors a relaxing view of the mix of water, stream, and forest. Travertine Nature Center is open year round except for Thanksgiving, Christmas Day, and New Year’s Day.",
