    "body": "Collections         Local children enjoy a visit to an underground launch control center in the 1960s. MIMI 2617  Minuteman Missile National Historic Site currently has thousands of artifacts in the collection. The majority of these artifacts were the furnishings and other miscellaneous items that were transferred from the United States Air Force along with structures of Launch Control Facility Delta-01 and Launch Facility (Missile Silo) Delta-09.  These collections items range from the couches in the day room to the water testing equipment used to monitor the well water. The proper management and storage of these artifacts is an essential part of our cultural resources program. You will have the opportunity to see many of these items on a ranger guided tour of Launch Control Facility Delta-01. Our collection is constantly growing. As former Air Force personnel, civilian contractors and other employees find out about the site, they have either saved these items for an eventual donation to the museum or kept them as souvenirs of their service. Finding Aids exist for some of the archival collections.  While we are accepting items into the collection, we ask that you download this form and fill it out. You may either e-mail us back or print it out and mail it back for consideration of your items. We would like to make sure that these items fit into our scope of collections.  The mailing address is: Minuteman Missile National Historic Site 24545 Cottonwood Road Philip, SD 57567",
