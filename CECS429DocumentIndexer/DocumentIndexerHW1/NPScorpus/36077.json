Water is available at Visitor Information Center, Diablo East, and Governors Landing. Do not drink untreated water.  Heat Exhaustion  Heat exhaustion occurs when the body loses more fluid than (is taken in). Signs of heat exhaustion include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headaches, pale appearance, stomach cramps, and cool clammy skin. If a member of your party begins to experience any of these symptoms, stop your activity immediately. Find a cool, shady area and have the victim rest with their feet up to distribute fluids throughout the body. It is important to drink fluids, but it is also important to eat. While suffering from heat exhaustion, drinking fluids without eating can lead to a potentially dangerous condition of low blood salt. If heat exhaustion symptoms persist for more than two hours, seek medical help.  Heat Stroke  Heat stroke is an advanced stage of heat exhaustion. It is the body's inability to cool itself. Symptoms include confusion, disorientation, behavioral changes, and seizures. If you believe that a member of your party is suffering from heat stroke, it is imperative to cool them using any available means and obtain immediate medical assistance.  Hypothermia Hypothermia occurs when the body is cooled to dangerous levels. It is responsible for the greatest number of deaths among people engaging in outdoor activities. Possible even in warm weather, it often occurs without the victim's awareness. It is a hazard on the lake because immersion in water is the quickest way to lose body heat. To prevent hypothermia, avoid cotton clothing (it provides no insulation when wet) and eat high energy food before you are chilled. The signs of hypothermia include uncontrollable shivering, stumbling and poor coordination, fatigue, and confusion or slurred speech. If you recognize any of these signs, stop what you are doing and immediately replace wet clothing with dry clothing.
