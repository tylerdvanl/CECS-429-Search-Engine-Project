Several adaptations help them with this aquatic lifestyle. Air pouches located in their upper necks keep them afloat when they are sleeping. Vibrissae, commonly known as whiskers, grow under their nose and are used to feel for food in the dark depths of the ocean. Many Alaska natives hunt walruses for a healthy source of food and for ivory, which is used in traditional craft making.",
