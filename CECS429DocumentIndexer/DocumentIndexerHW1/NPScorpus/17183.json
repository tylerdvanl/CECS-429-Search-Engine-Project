While trails are short (less than a mile each way) and do not loop, there are benches to enjoy the views and invite you to linger. Birding is excellent all year. Many come by canoe to explore the marsh. Small picnics (no cooking) are allowed in the park so one can relax while a friend is photographing lotus. Friendly dogs are allowed in the park, but must be on a leash at all times.",
