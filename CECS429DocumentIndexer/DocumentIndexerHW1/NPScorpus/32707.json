King Airport (code STT) and travel from there.    From the airport you rent a car and drive or take a taxi to Redhook (west end) St. Thomas.  From there you can either take  a car barge to St. John or the people ferry.  Here is a Google map to get from the airport to Cruz Bay, St. John. Once on St. John you can easily walk from the ferry terminal to the Visitor Center and the Lind Point Trailhead.  The 1 mile long Lind Point Trail provides hiking access to Salomon and Honeymoon beaches.  Here is your Google map for that short trip.   If you choose to rent a car on St. Thomas here is a Google map to get you from the car barge to the Visitor Center.             Welcome to the Virgin Islands National Park       Getting Around",
