In the process these interlopers have crowded out many native species that are vital to a healthy ecosystem. Park employees and volunteers use a variety of techniques including pulling plants, cutting seed heads, prescribed fire and applying chemicals to eliminate exotic species like Privet, Japanese Honeysuckle, Chinese Yam and Johnson Grass.",
