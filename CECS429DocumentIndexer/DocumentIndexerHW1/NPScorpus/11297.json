The objects constitute an assemblage specifically created for the birthplace by Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy with the intent that they be seen by the public. As part of the 1966-1969 restoration effort, a collection of household furnishings, photographs and significant mementos were personally collected and arranged in the principal rooms of the home by Mrs. Kennedy and her consultant, Jordan Marsh interior decorator Robert Luddington. Many pieces in the collection are original to the family's tenure in the house; others are Kennedy family pieces, appropriate antiques, or period reproductions selected for interpretive value. After restoration and refurnishing were completed, Mrs. Kennedy donated the house and its contents to the National Park Service.   Explore our collection item of the month by clicking here!
