    "body": "Hiking              One of the best ways to experience Yosemite is by taking a hike. Here are some of hikes available in different areas of Yosemite:  Yosemite Valley Glacier Point Road Wawona and Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias  Hetch Hetchy   White Wolf   Tuolumne Meadows  Also available:   A list of mileages for numerous trails in Yosemite.   Suggestions for where to see wildflowers   Snowshoe and cross-country trails for Glacier Point\/Yosemite Ski & Snowboard Area (formerly Badger Pass), Mariposa Grove, and Crane Flat area (these areas are usually snowy from mid December through March).          A Few Things to Remember While Hiking:  Stay on trails: taking shortcuts causes trail erosion--and is both dangerous and illegal. Carry (and drink) plenty of water: a leading cause of injuries on the trail is dehydration. Be sure to treat river, stream, lake, or spring water. Pets and bicycles are only permitted on bike paths. Horses and mules have the right of way on trails. Pack out what you pack in. Trails are not maintained nor are they regularly patrolled: travel carefully and at your own risk. Smoking while traveling on trails is prohibited, though you may smoke while stopped except when fire restrictions are in effect. (Crush out and dispose of cigarette butts in a trash receptacle.)",
