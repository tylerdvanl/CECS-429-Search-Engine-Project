Begin your hike from the parking area. Below the parking area two trails meet. One, an ancient trail, known as the Bad Pass Trail was seasonally traversed by American Indians moving between the Bighorn Basin and the Northern Plains. Nature is reclaiming this trail, which at times seems to be camouflaged by the junipers, mountain mohagany, and sagebrush. The other, a modern trail, leads south of the hill in front of the parking area and to the canyon rim. This is a great place to try getting a triple echo from the canyon.",
