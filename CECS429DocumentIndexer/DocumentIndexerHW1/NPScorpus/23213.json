    "body": "Cooperative Research       Many people, institutions, and agencies are researching the history of El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro. Through the Challenge Cost Share Program, the National Park Service forms partnerships with many different groups to encourage research activities along the trail. Our collective goal is to to protect, preserve, and commemorate the history and properties associated with El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro. A broad range of research topics are eligible for cost share funding. They could include: documenting a structure's history and architectural fabric and design in anticipation of stabilization or preservation actions; studies of trail sites that may be eligible for certification or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places; general research into the trail's history in a particular area that will contribute to an interpretive program; and many others.
