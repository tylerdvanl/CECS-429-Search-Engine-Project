Some important notes:  Campground opening and closing dates in the \"Open approx.\" column are tentative and can vary from year to year. View historical campground opening and closing dates. Reservations: campgrounds requiring reservations are usually full from around April through September. You should make a reservation as early as possible. If you don't have reservations, find out more about camping without reservations. Tap water and creek water: Campgrounds listed as having creek water have vault toilets (not regular restrooms). Campgrounds listed as having tap water have regular restrooms. Showers are only available in Yosemite Valley at Half Dome Village (formerly Curry Village) and Housekeeping Camp.
