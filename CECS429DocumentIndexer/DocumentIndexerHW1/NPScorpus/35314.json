Â    Preservation of historic places is a key element in historic interpretation and to understanding our nations past. The American Battlefield Protection Program (ABPP) fosters opportunities for stewardship of historic battlefields associated with wars on American soil. It seeks to protect battlefields and sites, to encourage and assist in planning for the preservation, interpretation and management of these sites, and to raise awareness of the importance of preserving battlefields and related sites. Yet the National Park Service can not do it alone. Groups such as the Civil War Preservation Trust and the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation are essential to the survival of countless acres of land as well as historic structures across the Shenandoah Valley,  Virginia and the United States. Their efforts allow future generations of Americans to visit and learn from historically significant sites that could be lost forever.
