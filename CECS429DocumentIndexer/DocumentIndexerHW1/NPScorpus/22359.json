Stay on trails and watch your step at all times. Do not leave children unsupervised.  In hot weather be sure to drink plenty of water, wear a hat, and use sunscreen.   Caution! The desert can be deadly for pets. Car temperatures rise quickly in the sun, even on cool days. Your pet can easily die of heat exhaustion. If you are leaving a pet in a car, crack the windows as much as possible and leave water to drink. We recommend you not leave pets in the car at all when the outside temperature exceeds 68 degrees, even with the windows cracked. Leashed pets are welcome on trails at Hovenweep. (More...)",
