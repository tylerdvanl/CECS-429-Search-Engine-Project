Being prepared is the key to a safe and fun desert adventure.     Always keep an ample supply of water with you while traveling through the park, whether driving or hiking. We recommend a minimum of one gallon of water per person, per day; hikers and cyclists should carry two gallons per person, per day. Avoid strenuous activity during times of extreme heat. Protect yourself from the sun by wearing sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat.  Remember, your safety is your responsibility.   Using GPS Navigation GPS Navigation in remote locations like Castle Mountains National Monument is notoriously unreliable. GPS maps aren't always up to date and sometimes lead travelers onto primitive or four-wheel drive roads that they are unprepared for. Travelers should always carry up-to-date road maps to check the accuracy of GPS directions. Use common sense before heading down a primitive dirt road in the desert.   Do not depend only on your vehicle or other GPS navigation system!",
