    "body": "Firearms in the Kantishna Area       Discharging of Firearms in the Kantishna Area is Prohibited September 1 - 15 each year. Concern for the safety of park visitors has prompted the National Park Service to initiate a closure to the discharge of firearms in the Kantishna area. This developed area has a large number of summer visitors using the facilities and surrounding area to engage in outdoor activities that could put them at risk of a firearm related injury. The restriction on the discharge of firearms applies on federal public lands within one mile of the Kantishna road right-of-way from the former Mt. McKinley National Park boundary at mile 87. 9 to the north end of the Kantishna airport. The firearm restriction is in effect from September 1 through September 15 each year. During the period of the firearms discharge restriction, subsistence harvests utilizing other methods and means according to federal subsistence management regulations, may still take place. Consult the regulations booklet for information on hunts in the Kantishna area and methods of harvest. Kantishna Area Access Access to the Kantishna Hills area is primarily through use of the Denali Park Road. Park Road travel restrictions are in place during the busy visitor season between June 1 and September 15. A Park Road travel permit is required for subsistence users accessing the Kantishna Hills for subsistence use. Access permits are available by calling the park at 907-683-9544.",
