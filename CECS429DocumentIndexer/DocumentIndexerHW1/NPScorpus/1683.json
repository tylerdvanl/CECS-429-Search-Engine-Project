The fee waiver will allow qualifying groups free entry into the park for educational or scientific purposes. New Fee Waiver Process (January 2016) Tuzigoot National Monument is grouped with Montezuma Castle National Monument (as well as Montezuma Well!). You only need to fill out one fee waiver for Tuzigoot and Montezuma Castle (Montezuma Well is free, but we would like to know your plans to be able to accommodate you). To request an educational fee waiver, please use the following procedure:  Fax a Fee Waiver Form at least two weeks in advance of your planned visit. The rest of the request should be on school or educational institution letterhead and clearly state that you are requesting a fee waiver for educational purposes. For quicker response, include your fax number in the letter.  State the educational purpose of your visit, i.e., what your group will be studying during their park visit. And additional pages if necessary.  Include your itinerary! Indicate the date(s) and times you are planning to visit the park and include the number of students with the ages or grade levels and the number of adults that you will be bringing.  You may also review the Fee Waiver Form Directions. Please fax your request to Tuzigoot at 928-567-6602. Questions? Contact Judy Sokoll by email. Heading to Montezuma Castle, too?
