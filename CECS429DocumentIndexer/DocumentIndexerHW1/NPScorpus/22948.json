This is North America's largest desert, the majority of which is located to our south in Mexico. This desert region amounts to about 175,000 square miles, stretching some 1200 miles south from Alamogordo, New Mexico, to the Mexican state of San Luis Potosi. The elevation ranges from near 1,000 feet above sea level along the Rio Grande in Texas to 10,000 feet in the mountainous regions of Mexico, with a large portion found above 4,000 feet. Winters are cool, with nighttime temperatures falling below freezing an average of 100 times per year in the northern latitudes and climbing as high as 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius) in some regions. The Chihuahuan desert differs from the Sonoran and Mojave deserts by receiving more summer rain during monsoon thunderstorms and having colder winters.",
