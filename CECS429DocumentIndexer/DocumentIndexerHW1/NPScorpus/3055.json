    "body": "Vineyard                 Vineyard:  James Whitmore planted over a thousand grapevines, although few are believed to have survived. Later settlers planted grapevines as well.  Perpendicular to the walkway by the orchard is a 120+ year old grapevine which has spread to the tops of the surrounding cottonwood trees. Parallel to the walkway are three more modern varieties of grapes, two red and one white.  The grape was most versatile. The fruit itself, raisins, grape juice and wine are among the foodstuffs it provided. But vinegar made from the grapes would have been most useful to the Mormon settlers, as it was used to preserve foods. Such preservation enabled the settlers to provide good food to visitors year round.         << back continue >>                      Gardens   38 Photos  Gardens, Orchards, and Vineyards in Pipe Spring National Monument",
