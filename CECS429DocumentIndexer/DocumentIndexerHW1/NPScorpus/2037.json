However, the rock foundation of the that first church remains intact today and the Park preservation crew maintains an adobe and lime plaster marker on top of it to indicate where the original church once stood.       Photo by Jana Tschopp        Photo by Jana Tschopp        Photo by Jana Tschopp        Photo by Jana Tschopp",
