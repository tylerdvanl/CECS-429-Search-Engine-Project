    "body": "Hiking        Hikers below Manly Beacon        What to expect There are few constructed trails here, but in a place this desolate you usually don't need them. Most hiking routes in the park are cross-country, up canyons, or along ridges. Although footing can be rough and rocky (wear boots), and dry falls may need to be scaled, thick brush is uncommon. First time hikers to the desert may find trailless hiking intimidating, but once you adjust to it, you discover there are almost unlimited hiking possibilities. With that freedom comes the responsibility to take care of yourself and the land. Learn about the area Before starting a hike, talk to a ranger or read about the area. Ask at the Visitor Center or ranger stations about current road conditions, water availability, and weather forecasts. Detailed topographic maps are necessary for some of the hikes listed here and are available at the Furnace Creek Visitor Center and other Ranger Stations throughout the park. Hiking seasons The best time to hike in Death Valley is from October through April. Summer temperatures can be dangerous in the park's lower elevations. Even during spring and autumn the heat can be unbearable for most people. Avoid hiking on the salt flats or anywhere below sea level when it's hot. Save the low elevation hikes for the cooler winter days. The high peaks are a pleasant escape from the heat in summer, but are usually covered with snow in the winter and spring. If you must climb them during winter season, be sure to be properly equipped with adequate winter clothing, an ice axe and crampons. Solitude is the norm in the park's backcountry, but in the springtime and on holiday weekends you will see other people, especially at the most popular hiking locations. Water Due to the dry climate of Death Valley, you must drink more water here than in other places, even in the cooler winter months. Always carry adequate water (at least 2 liters for a short winter dayhike, 1 gallon or more for longer warm season hikes and overnighters). Don't \"save it for later\", be sure to drink it as you hike. If you are feeling thirsty, you are getting dehydrated. Springs and other natural water sources are rare and should not be considered reliable. Boil or treat water from these sources before using.
