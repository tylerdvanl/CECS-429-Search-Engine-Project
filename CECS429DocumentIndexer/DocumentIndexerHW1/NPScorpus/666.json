    "body": "Animals       It is amazing to consider how animals arrived in Hawai`i, the most isolated major island chain in the world. Over millions of years following their formation by volcanoes, these islands, stretching over 1,500 miles, were slowly populated by animals arriving over vast distances—blown by the wind or carried by the sea. Twenty four hundred miles from the nearest continent or island group, the Hawaiian Islands are known for their ecological diversity and endemic fauna. Around 95 percent of native Hawaiian animals are found no where else in the world, having evolved here on the islands following colonization by their ancestors.  Kalaupapa peninsula is rich with marine and terrestrial wildlife.
