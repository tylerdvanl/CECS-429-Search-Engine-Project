It is believed that the name Paso de Francia (France Way) was given to this ford after Alonso De León's third entrada into Texas in 1689 in search of the colony of René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle. De León's entry is the earliest crossing that can be accurately ascribed to Paso de Francia, although the Bosque-Larios expedition of 1675 may have also used this ford.
