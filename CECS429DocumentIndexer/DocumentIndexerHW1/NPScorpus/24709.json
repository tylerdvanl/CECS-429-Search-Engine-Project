Volunteers may occasionally help out at Alagnak Wild River with various aspects of park management including resource management and archeological field work. Some of our volunteers work through the Student Conservation Association (SCA) and the Serve Alaska Youth Corps (SAGA). Volunteer positions are somewhat limited due to lack of housing. Positions are filled by March for the following summer season. For more information on the Volunteer Program at Alagnak contact us.
