NPS       A Summer Professional Development Opportunity Imagine spending your summer hiking through spruce-fir forests, exploring tidepools, or sailing on clear waters in search of bald eagles, porpoises, and seals. Leave your classroom behind to do all this and more as a teacher fellow at Acadia National Park. The Acadia Teacher Fellowship connects classroom teachers to the rich cultural, natural, and recreational heritage protected by Acadia National Park. The National Park Service provides teacher fellows with uniforms and shared housing, if needed, as well as a $400 weekly stipend. A certificate of completion and continuing education hours are available.   What would I do in the park? Teacher fellows become part of the park's interpretation and education division. Duties vary, but each fellow is given the opportunity to engage with the public on programs or on the trail. At the park, possible activities include time with trained interpreters, field researchers, protection rangers, resource management staff, trail crews, teacher institute, and citizen science. Fellows are expected to work on an education project for the park and prepare a place-based lesson plan that will be used in their classrooms and posted on the park's website.    What are the benefits? To Teachers:    Obtain a wide range of new knowledge and skills through working with park staff and partners Gain access to an extensive array of teaching resources and tools to enhance classroom curriculum in multiple content areas Receive a certificate of completion and continuing education hours  Begin or deepen a personal and professional connection with national parks  To Schoolchildren:  Place-based learning Opportunities and resources  to connect to their natural and cultural heritage in new way Awareness of the possibilities for volunteering and paid employment with the National Park Service  What is the time commitment? Teachers are expected to commit to four to eight weeks between June and September. Local teachers may divide this time over the course of the year to meet the needs of teachers and the park. Who is eligible? The park accepts applications from all public K-12 teachers. Teachers from all disciplines are encouraged to apply. Priority is given to teachers in Maine. What is expected of me after this program? Teacher fellows will leave the park with the resources to develop tailored, curriculum-based units that help students better understand their natural and cultural heritage and the importance of shared stewardship. Fellows are given the opportunity to take their classes to the nearest national park or other public land site. Transportation, entrance and program fees, and substitute teachers are paid for by a park partner. Teachers make the trip arrangements and report on the trip experience.  In the spring, near National Park Week, teacher fellows wear their uniforms to school and present programs to introduce students and staff to the National Park Service and their own experiences at Acadia. Teachers will be asked to explore the possibilities for creating or enhancing an outdoor classroom and climate change initiatives at their schools. This unique learning space will allow classes in all disciplines to link with and learn from the resources protected by Acadia National Park. How do I apply?

I found my understanding of teaching and learning greatly expanded. This experience has inspired me to incorporate the power of place based learning in my classroom. As the summer ends I feel rejuvenated, refreshed and ready to be back to be a better teacher. I feel so lucky to have had this opportunity. - Ann Luginbuhl, Charlotte Elementary, Charlotte, ME Spending the summer as a Teacher Fellow was life changing. I had no idea that a professional development experience could be so productive and enjoyable. This experience solidified something that I already knew… that learning experiences are so much more meaningful when they are active. The citizen science projects inspired me to find and create similar experiences for my students. I have never considered myself a science scholar, but the projects I worked on really sparked my interest and passion in the subject. I hope to have the same effect on my students. Thank you SO much for this opportunity. I would recommend the program and park highly to anyone. - Natalie Pulsipher, Natchaug School, Willimantic, CT Participating in the Teacher Fellow program at Acadia NP was a truly unique and special experience in so many ways, both personally and professionally. I took away a lot of different teaching strategies and activities from the rangers and other teachers I met. Getting to spend my summer outside exploring such a beautiful and inspiring place like Acadia National Park was reenergizing. One of the most special and important parts of the experience was the opportunity to take my middle school students to the national park for a day of tide pooling and exploring outdoors. Kids who normally are reluctant learners in the classroom were engaged and enthusiastic during the trip. Students were having so much fun exploring they forgot they were learning science! - Genevieve Smith, James F. Doughty School, Bangor, ME The Teacher Fellow program allowed me the opportunity to meet with and practice citizen science projects that I brought back to the classroom. Linking students to real science and their national park makes learning real. - Kim Scantlebury, Camden Hills Regional High School, Rockport, ME I never imagined that being an Acadia Teacher Fellow would open up such an amazing, fulfilling world of discovery for me!! I pinched myself every day I was there, thinking… “Is this really happening to me?! Am I really here doing all this?!” I really learned so much! Along with all my learning, I have been inspired to create an adventure of discovery for my students. Learning should be an exploration where discoveries spark your curiosity to want to learn more! I have numerous ideas and lessons that I gathered while a ATF that I want to apply to our environment. It’s going to be an experience that keeps giving! - DeLene Hoffner, School of the Woods, Colorado Springs, CO I am a technology teacher by trade. This is my first exposure to the many different disciplines in science and I really liked it. I learned so much. This experience will also help me integrate science into my curriculum, both computer science and a\/v production classes. It has shown me how to take my class outdoors. Through hiking, bicycling and exploring the island I feel stronger, both mentally and physically. It is important for teachers to maintain good physical and mental health so they can help students during the school year. Working at Acadia National Parked helped me do this. - Ronny Armstrong, Boswell High School, Fort Worth, TX",
