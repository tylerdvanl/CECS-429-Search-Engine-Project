In fact, approximately ten percent of our total visitation, or sixty thousand people, visit the Castillo every year as part of a school visit. We are sorry but we are unable to provide Ranger-led educational tours. Schools which perform a self-guided field trip are eligible for and may request a waiver of the admission fees. If you tour the Castillo de San Marcos NM with a Commercial Tour Guide you do not qualify for an Educational Fee Waiver.  For an Academic Fee Waiver form please call 904-829-6506, x239.
