    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit           Plan Your Visit       Where to begin your Lewis and Clark Adventure? Step into the Fort Clatsop replica, at Lewis and Clark National Historical Park, and you'll get a real sense of what the Corps of Discovery experienced more than 200 years ago. It looks, smells, and feels pretty much the same. In peak visitor season, rangers in buckskins offer demonstrations such as flintlock gun shooting, hide tanning and candle making.They're patient, friendly and used to lots of questions about the Corps. Check out the historic canoe landing and consider adding a short walk on one of the nearby trails. If it starts to rain, take a break inside the Visitor Center, which features excellent films, bookstore with children's books and games and other displays. Don't forget to ask to become a Junior Ranger! The activity book is free and loads of fun. The Lewis and Clark National Historical Park also hosts a number of free lectures and other special events throughout the year.",
