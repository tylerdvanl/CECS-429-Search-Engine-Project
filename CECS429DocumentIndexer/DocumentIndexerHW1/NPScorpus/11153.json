We are pleased to inform the public about the renewed strategic planning effort being undertaken at the Olmsted NHS. The site has made enormous progress in thirty years, but “Fairsted,” as Olmsted named it, now faces new challenges. Recently the site received funding to revise and update the park’s General Management Plan. Your perspectives and input are critical to the creation of a renewed vision for the site and an enlightened plan for the future.      The Fairsted landscape illustrates many of the principles of landscape design practiced by Frederick Law Olmsted and the successor firms. The Cultural Landscape Report references hundreds of historic plans, photographs, and written documents which were all critical elements in the National Park Service to restore the grounds of Olmsted National Historic Site.
