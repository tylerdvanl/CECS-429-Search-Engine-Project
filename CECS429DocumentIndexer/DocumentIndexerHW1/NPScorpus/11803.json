    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Goods & Services               Goods & Services       Point Reyes National Seashore is largely an outdoors\/wilderness park. As such, aside from the Visitor Center bookstores and a hostel, there are no goods or services available within the National Seashore. However, there are a few nearby communities with post offices, outfitters and tour guides, and businesses providing basic necessities for most visitors. Before you arrive at Point Reyes National Seashore, be sure to obtain whatever you may need during your visit, such as food, beverages, batteries for cameras, etc., at one of the local stores. You may also want to fill up your vehicle beforehand, especially if you plan on driving to the Lighthouse which is located more than 32 kilometers (20 miles) from the nearest gas station. Our Miscellaneous Services page lists the local ATMs, bank, laundromat, libraries, medical clinics, pharmacy, and places of worship. Top of Page",
