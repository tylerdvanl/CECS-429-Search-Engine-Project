    "body": "East Cabin              East Cabin: The room you are standing in was built as a “guard house” in 1868 by the Mormon militia. Pipe Spring was chosen as an outpost and supply base on the Arizona Strip because of its reliable water and strategic location between the Vermilion Cliffs to the north and Kanab Creek canyon to the southeast. The need for such a base arose in the mid-1860s when the Navajo began raiding Mormon settlements in southern Utah and the Arizona Strip.
