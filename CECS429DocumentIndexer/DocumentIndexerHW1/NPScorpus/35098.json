You will need a permit for all overnight trips in the backcountry. During the spring and fall, permit availability is highly competitive. If you plan to visit Canyonlands during peak season, you may have to reserve your permit up to four months in advance. Where can I camp?Park staff have divided the backcountry of Canyonlands into sites and zones, and access to each is limited. Backpackers in heavily traveled areas stay in designated campsites, primarily at The Needles. Most backpackers at Island in the Sky or The Maze stay in at-large zones and may choose their own campsites.I'm camping in an at-large zone. How do I pick a campsite?You must locate your campsite at least 1 mile from a road, and at least 300 feet away from an archeological site, historic site, or  Where can I find drinking water?Water is a limiting factor for most backcountry trips in Canyonlands. There are springs scattered throughout the park, mostly in canyon bottoms. In some large areas, such as The Grabens at The Needles and the entire White Rim bench at Island in the Sky, there are no reliable water sources. Obtaining drinking water from the Colorado or Green rivers is difficult as the water is very silty and hard to purify. We encourage backpacking groups to pack in water whenever possible. Many springs marked on topographic maps may dry up during periods of drought. Ask at visitor centers about spring locations and current conditions. Check the sections below for information on camping in each district of the park.       Backpackers in The Needles NPS\/Neal Herbert       Backpacking at The Needles    Salt Creek Trail Closure A 1.5-mile section of Salt Creek Canyon centered on the junction of Salt Creek and Angel Arch canyon is temporarily closed due to unsafe conditions caused by a wildfire. You may hike the Salt Creek Trail from Cathedral Butte or from the north Salt Creek gate, but must turn back at the closure. Read more and see a map of the trail closure. [120 kb PDF]      The Needles is the most popular backpacking destination in the park. You can access most trailheads with a two-wheel-drive vehicle. You may find water seasonally in many of the canyons east of Chesler Park. Inquire at the visitor center about the status of backcountry water sources. Permits are required for all overnight trips into the backcountry. During the spring and fall, demand for permits is very high. If you plan to visit Canyonlands during peak season—especially during spring break (March)—you may have to make a reservation four months in advance. Designated campsites (one group per site) are established along most trails. In areas where there are no established campsites, backpackers camp in at-large zones. Visiting The Needles Maps Hiking in The Needles Backcountry Regulations       Back to Top        Most long trails at Island in the Sky have elevation changes of 1,000-2,000 feet, and require negotiating steep slopes. NPS\/Neal Herbert       Backpacking at Island in the Sky  Island in the Sky is a challenging place to backpack. The landscape below the mesa top is a mixture of talus slopes and vast basins without any reliable water sources. Some trails lead below the White Rim Road to the rivers, but river water is silty and difficult to purify. All overnight routes involve a descent of over 1,000 feet, except Murphy Point which is on the mesa top and is an ideal destination for single-night trips. Backpackers camp in an at-large zone unless traveling along the Syncline Trail where there is a designated site. A permit is required for all overnight trips.  Visiting Island in the Sky Maps Hiking at Island in the Sky Backcountry Regulations    Back to Top       Backpacking at The Maze  Trails in the Maze are primitive and lead into canyons and to various viewpoints. Due to the nature and depth of Maze canyons, access to them is limited. Routes into the canyons are cairned from mesa top to canyon bottom, but routes through washes are often unmarked. Many of the canyons look alike and are difficult to identify without a topographic map.  The Maze Overlook Trail and other routes in the district require basic climbing maneuvers in order to negotiate sections of steep slickrock and pour-offs. A 25-foot length of rope is often essential for raising or lowering packs in difficult spots. Many routes may make hikers with a fear of heights uncomfortable. Permits are required for all overnight trips in the backcountry. During the spring and fall, demand for permits frequently exceeds the number available. If you plan to visit Canyonlands during peak season, it is recommended that you make reservations well in advance. Backpackers stay in at-large zones. There are several reliable springs in the canyons of the Maze, and the status of these springs is available at the Hans Flat Ranger Station. Getting to Trailheads Most trailheads start from four-wheel-drive roads. Visitors with two-wheel-drive vehicles may park at the North Point Road junction, approximately 2.5 miles southeast of the Hans Flat Ranger Station, and hike 15 miles to the Maze Overlook. Depending on the vehicle, hikers may also be able to negotiate the 14-mile road to park at the top of the Flint Trail switchbacks. Another popular way for backpackers to reach the Maze is via jet boat shuttle from Moab. A two-hour shuttle provides access to Spanish Bottom on the Colorado River. From there, a foot trail climbs over 1,000 feet to the Doll House. Jet boat shuttles are available from two companies: Tex's Riverways: (877) 662-2839 or (435) 259-5101 Tag-A-Long Expeditions: (435) 259-8946    Visiting The Maze Maps Backcountry Regulations",
