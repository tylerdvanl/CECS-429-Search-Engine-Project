The following are descriptions and requirements for the parks' seasonal interpreter program. Historical Interpreter Historical Interpreters provide a variety of personal services to park visitors. While most people identify the word \"interpreter\" with someone who translates from one language to another, the historical interpreter does something similar by helping visitors to better understand and appreciate the parks' significance. Historical Interpreters should be interested in American History and enjoy meeting with the public and talking with people of all nationalities. Seasonal staff serve in the Interpretation Division of Richmond National Battlefield Park, staffing any of the park's five visitor centers or the visitor center at Maggie L. Walker National Historic Site. This involves answering visitor inquiries about the park and local points of interest, as well as research questions about park history. A key duty is to research, develop and conduct a walking tour over one of the area battlefields or of Maggie L. Walker's home. Richmond National Battlefield Park visitor facilities are open seven days a week; Maggie L. Walker National Historic Site is open Monday through Saturday. Weekend work will be required. Internships may be arranged for college students majoring in History, American Studies, Historic Preservation or a related field. Education Program Assistant Education Program Assistants participate in curriculum based programs that enable teachers and students to learn about various facets of the park's story and the National Park Service. They work under the direct supervision of the park Education Coordinator. Seasonal staff research, prepare and conduct programs to schools, day camps and organized youth groups that visit Richmond National Battlefield Park and Maggie L. Walker National Historic Site. Program themes include Civil War soldier and civilian life, area battles, African American History, Women's History and National Park Stewardship. Seasonal staff should have both knowledge and interest in American History. Internships may be arranged for college students majoring in History or American Studies, who have also taken education course-work. Particular projects may have time requirements and assignments will depend upon the amount of college credit to be earned. These positions are highly competitive and the parks generally receive many more applications than there are positions to fill. Those interested should apply in the fall for the following summer.
