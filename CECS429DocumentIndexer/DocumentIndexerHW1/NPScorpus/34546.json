The park currently identifies wetlands using the National Wetland Inventory maps, but several studies are underway to help better refine these maps. Areas along stream banks are considered wetlands, thus greatly increasing the number of wetland areas in the park. The park has several known wetland areas beyond stream banks, with Big Meadows being the most visible and studied wetland. At Big Meadows, two Mafic Fens (types of wetlands) contain globally rare plant communities believed to be endemic to the Park and support eight state rare plant species. The Meadow also supports an abundance of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and insects, some of which are not found elsewhere in the Park. A rare snake, a rare insect, and several salamander and bird species are among the animals that occupy the Big Meadows wetland areas. Although we currently know little about all of the wetlands in the park, we can expect that at least a portion of them contain flora and fauna unique to wetland habitats.
