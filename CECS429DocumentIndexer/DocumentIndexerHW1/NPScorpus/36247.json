    "body": "Field Trips      Each year, hundreds of school kids visit Alibates Flint Quarries. A visit here will allow students to step back in time and explore the resources that helped shape - and were shaped by - early civilizations in the Texas Panhandle and the Great Plains. Groups of 25 or under are strongly recommended. Walks are one mile in length, with an elevation gain of more than 150 feet on fairly rough terrain. The educational walks usually take about two hours. School groups must provide 1 adult for every 10 children. Please contact Park Headquarters for scheduling your class field trip at (806) 857-3151.
