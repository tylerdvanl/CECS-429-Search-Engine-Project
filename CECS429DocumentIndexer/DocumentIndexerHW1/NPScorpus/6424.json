The Rural Electrification Act provided a \"fair chance\" for those living in rural places.      ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND THE WEST Abraham Lincoln wanted to populate the West and take advantage of the region's commercial and agricultural potential. He also sought to rapidly establish a western base of population, and institutions that were sympathetic to the Union cause. These were his motivations in supporting the passage of the Homestead Act of 1862, among other legislation.",
