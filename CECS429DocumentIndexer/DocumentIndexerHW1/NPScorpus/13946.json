    "body": "Join Our Friends            Join The Friends of Mammoth Cave National Park      The \"Monarch of Caves\" has astounded visitors and played an integral role in the life and economy of Central Kentucky for generations. Millions have visited, but for each individual the experience is like no other, a moment of self-discovery as unique as the place itself. How old were you when you first went down those stairs into the great Wonder of Wonders? Do you remember it? When was the last time you came to the cave? Listen - It's calling to you now...  In your visits to the cave, you have trod in the paths of Ralph Waldo Emerson, of Jenny Lind, of Edwin Booth. Did your steps take you through Fat Man's Misery or Mammoth Dome? To Frozen Niagara or River Styx? Did you jump when you saw your first cave cricket, or feel the thrill when the guide turned out the lights? Perhaps you've bundled up for the Cave Sing during the holidays or canoed the languid Green River in summertime. Do you remember the ranger guiding the tour, or explaining the latest scientific discovery, or telling the story of doomed Floyd Collins by the campfire circle? The park still strives to do these things - the same personal experience, plus new science, new programs, new experiences, new trails - and more. But it isn't easy, and the park could use some friends … friends like You.",
