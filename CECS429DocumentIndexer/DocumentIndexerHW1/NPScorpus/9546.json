Clara Barton dedicated her life and energies to help others in times of need - both home and abroad, in peacetime as well as during military emergencies. Glen Echo was her home the last 15 years of her life and the structure illustrates her dedication and concern for those less fortunate than herself. The house is shown by guided tours only. Tours are free and offered only on Saturdays at 11, Noon, 2, and 3 and Sundays at 1, 2, 3, and 4.         Glen Echo Park is part of the George Washington Memorial Parkway. A variety of sites, including the nearby Great Falls Park and Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial located in Arlington National Cemetery, make up the Parkway and each of those sites offers a unique experience.
