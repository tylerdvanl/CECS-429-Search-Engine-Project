Volunteers play a major role in the stewardship of our national parks.  Volunteers work in almost every area of the parks, contributing their enthusiasm, skills, and time to help preserve and protect the parks' natural and cultural resources, and to serve and educate visitors. Both individuals and organized groups are welcome to volunteer, and opportunities are available for all ages and skill levels. INDIVIDUAL VOLUNTEERS There are year-round opportunities, most of which are available in the high season. Your contribution of time, energy, and skills helps us protect the cultural and natural resources within the parks, and you'll go home with a sense of pride while caring for your national parks. Check out the current openings on our Individual Volunteers page. GROUPS can also join us for short or long-term projects scheduled throughout the year, with most projects taking place in the summer. During the summer months, volunteer groups can camp for no charge at the Wolverton Service Camp. Groups with volunteers of all ages are encouraged and welcome to participate. See our Group Volunteers page for more information.    Â                 Wolverton Service Camp   7 Photos  Groups and individuals camp out during organized service projects.
