NPS Photos       National Park sites are outdoor classrooms. Visiting these sites - whether virtually or actually - we learn about the people, places and history of this nation. The Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail is no exception, but have you ever seen a 3700-mile long classroom? Visitor centers along the Trail help people to learn about the Expedition through programs, exhibits, special events. Many of these centers also offer special children's programs and\/or activity books.   Become a Junior Ranger without leaving home by simply completing the Junior Ranger activities. Once you're done, send in your completed activities to earn a Lewis and Clark Junior Web Ranger patch - all from the comfort of your own home. Want to learn more?
