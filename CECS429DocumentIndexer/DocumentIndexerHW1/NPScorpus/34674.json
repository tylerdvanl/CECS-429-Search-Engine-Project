Conditions at Big Meadows, MP 51 (AWS)  Park Weather Forecast, above 2000 ft (NOAA)  Conditions at Headquarters (SHEN-RAWS) Conditions at Sawmill Ridge, MP 97 (SHEN-RAWS)    Â    Seasons Four distinct seasons make Shenandoah a new and exciting place to be each and every month. Although best known for its vibrant fall foliage, the park is no less spectacular (and a lot less crowded) in spring when the wildflowers and trees are in full bloom. Summer brings lush greens and welcome relief from the valley temperatures. The park's elevation encourages as much as a 10-degree difference. That same difference can bring dramatic changes in winter. When surrounding lowlands are experiencing rain, the park can be blanketed in snow and ice. But the clear skies and bare trees of winter make the park's vistas magnificent and wildlife tracking and viewing particularly rewarding.",
