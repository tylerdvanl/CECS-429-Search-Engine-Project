    "body": "17 - Message from the Kaibab Paiute          We, the Kaibab Paiute people, were placed here by the Creator. We remain connected to this land that has sustained us from the beginning of time. We have been able to survive because we live with nature and respect the land - its plants, animals and water. These precious resources will continue to provide life to the People as long as we care for these gifts from the Creator. Living in harmony with the environment provides security, happiness and well being in our lives. We care for this land and give thanks to the Creator for all that surrounds us.        << back     continue >>",
