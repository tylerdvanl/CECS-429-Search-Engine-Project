Hummel  Approximately thirty-five species of freshwater plants reside in the the waters and wetlands of Pipestone National Monument. Arrow-heads, sedges, and allegheny monkey flowers are among a few of those species found within the Monument's aquatic environments. Many of the surveyed freshwater plants which occur at the Monument are listed in the table below.   Many of these species are at risk from the spread of non-native Reed Canary grass which forms thick mats of vegetation in wet areas and quickly outcompetes and replaces native water plants.
