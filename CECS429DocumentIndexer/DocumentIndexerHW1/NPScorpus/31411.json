Even if your pet does not chase deer, birds, or ground critters, it still presents the image and scent of a historical predator. The result is stress on the native wildlife. In addition, predators such as owls, coyotes, mountain lions, and javelinas can and do kill pets. Even large dogs cannot defend themselves against predators. Contagious diseases can also be transmitted between your dog and native coyotes and other wild animals. Having a pet with you may limit some of your activities and explorations in the park. Abiding by these pet regulations will ensure a safer, more enjoyable visit for yourselves, other park visitors, your pet, and the park's wildlife.  Pets are not allowed on trails, off roads, or on the river. Your pet can only go where your car can go.  Pets need to be on a leash no longer than six feet in length (or in a cage) at all times. You may not leave your pet unattended in vehicles if it creates a danger to the animal, or if the animal becomes a public nuisance. If you plan to hike or take a river trip, someone must stay behind with the pet, or you will need to make arrangements with a kennel service. There is no kennel service in the park. Pet etiquette and park regulations require that you always clean up after your pet and dispose of waste in trash receptacles.",
