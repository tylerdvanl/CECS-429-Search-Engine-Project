Ozark National Scenic riverways preserves riparian, upland forest, aquatic and subterranean habitats for wildlife. Whitetailed deer and wild turkey delight hunters while at least 198 species of birds are waiting for the avid birder. Relict glade habitats are home to some of the more unusual animals in the Ozarks, including collared lizards more typical of the US Southwest and even tarantulas and scorpions! A prescribed fire regime keeps these habitats healthy. Learn more about fire management in the park by clicking on the Fire link in the environmental Factors webpage.

They nourish and refresh us and provide a home for dazzling varieties of fish and wildlife and trees and plants of every sort. We are a nation rich in rivers. \"- (Charles Kuralt, On the Road With Charles Kuralt)",
