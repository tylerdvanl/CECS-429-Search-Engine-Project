In order to coordinate special park use events, and ensure the preservation of the park's history and resources for the enjoyment of all visitors, most special events and activities held in the park require a special use permit, issued only after the National Park Service (NPS) determines, from the applicant's information, that the activities involved will not impair park values and resources.  Â     Who needs a special use permit? A special use permit is required for activities that provide a benefit to an individual, group, or organization rather than the public at large and that require some degree of management from the National Park Service to protect park resources and the public interest. These special use permits must be obtained in advance and may require payment of a fee. Some examples of special events that require permits are:  Reserving the picnic shelter Commercial filming and photography Commerical tours First Amendment Activities Weddings Scientific research  General Permits Special events, first amendment activities, and any potential ground-disturbing activities in the park require the issuance of a special use permit.
