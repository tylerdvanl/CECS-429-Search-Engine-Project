    "body": "Planning         Resource damage caused by illegal off-road driving. NPS Photo   Stay Involved in the Management of Your National Parks Padre Island National Seashore is proposing to reclaim areas within the park's wind-tidal flats that have been damaged by illegal off-road driving. The reclamation project would restore the surface hydrology of the tidal flats as well as help to restore the natural viewshed of the area. Reclamation of the wind-tidal flats would also offer an opportunity to monitor the effects of recovery efforts on this unique ecosystem. The experimental component of the reclamation would add to the knowledge base for future reclamation projects both within and outside of the National Seashore.   The areas under consideration for research and reclamation are those where driving is and always has been prohibited. Yarborough Pass and Back Island Road will in no way be affected. No roads will be closed for any time as a result of this project. See the link below for more information.
