NPS design and construction projects follow guiding principles for sustainable development at federal facilities, including use of energy efficient lighting, natural light, best management practices for erosion and sedimentation control, and stormwater design that captures most or all rainwater to keep nutrients and sediments from entering the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay.
