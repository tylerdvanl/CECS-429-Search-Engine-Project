Altogether, 20 have been documented within the park. Some of these animals are quite visible, while others are more difficult to spot. Some animals are active during the daytime hours, but many are active only at night. Even those that aren’t evident are there, though, and play as important of a role as the more conspicuous mammals.  Eastern White-tailed Deer and Gray Squirrel are two of the most obvious mammals that live in the battlefield. Their presence is easily observed during the day, as they forage for food throughout the park.  Beavers are present in the park’s western-most battlefield, Five Forks. In this area, there is a large, still active, beaver dam located along Hatcher’s Run. This dam has created a wetland habitat, with standing water spreading out into a small pond. Have you ever seen a Southern Fying Squirrel? Probably not, because these mammals, along with Raccoons and many others, are almost strictly nocturnal.  Petersburg National Battlefield is also home to several predators, including the Gray Fox, Coyote, and Bobcat. These predators are rarely seen, though, as they shy away from human interference and are very adept at remaining hidden.",
