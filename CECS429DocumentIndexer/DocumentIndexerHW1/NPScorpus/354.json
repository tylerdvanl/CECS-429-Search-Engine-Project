The St. Croix River and the Namekagon River flow through over 200 miles of some of the least developed country in the upper Midwest. The images here are high resolution and can be used for most print projects.          Gordon Dam to Riverside   10 Photos  The St. Croix River between Gordon Dam and Riverside is subject to water level fluctuations that can make canoeing difficult, even though the scenery is still great.          Riverside to St. Croix Falls Dam   13 Photos  The river is wider, but can still be shallow in places. Banks are mostly low with silver maples and marshes, though there is a diversity of habitats.            St Croix Falls Dam to Stillwater   14 Photos  The St. Croix is now a \"big\" river. High bluffs, with floodplains and backwater sloughs add to the character. Recreation is by both boats and canoes, though even here shallow spots can be found .          Namekagon River   20 Photos  These photos show the Namekagon River from its beginnings below Namekagon Dam until just before it joins with the St. Croix River. While they can not compare with the real thing, we hope you will enjoy the views.",
