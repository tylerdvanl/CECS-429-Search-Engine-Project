Crater Lake Science & Learning Center Crater Lake National Park is one of America's oldest national parks and has been a source of public enjoyment and inspiration for over 100 years. Millions of Americans have gazed on the sublime beauty of Crater Lake. But few realize that under this beautiful veneer lies an outstanding outdoor laboratory and classroom; a place that draws scientists, teachers and students to investigate, instruct and learn from and about our natural world. From scenery to science and education, the Park's value to society is expanding.  This Center was born from the collective vision of the Park and its partners to establish Crater Lake National Park as a wellspring for research information, a proving ground for educational techniques and a source of inspiration for artistic expression. By supporting scientists and their investigations we will discover more and more about this special place. By connecting scientists with teachers and in turn with students and the visiting public, we believe that the park will become a focal point for life long learning. We established the Crater Lake Science and Learning Center to mold this future. It was created from dreams and imagination and made real through the perseverance and hard work of the park staff and our partners. It is sustained through generous public and private financial support. This facility is for the scientist, teacher, student and artist. We welcome them here to lend their talents, share their discoveries, and teach the lessons that will inspire the next generation to explore deeper, learn more and enrich us all.      Artist-In-Residence Program Artists have had a long relationship with this country's national parks and have influenced their development. The Crater Lake Waltz, photography of Peter Britt, traditional art and dance of the Tribal communities, and hand-tinted photographs of Fred Kiser are but a few examples of ways that artists have reached a special place in the hearts of visitors to Crater Lake National Park. The park is currently accepting applications for 2016. Applications are due February 1, 2016. You can download the 2016 application and information here. Update: We've received all applications for 2016 residencies and will review them on March 17, 2016. We will be able to announce the selected artists shortly thereafter on our Artist-in-Residence webpage.      Check out the NEW and growing Crater Lake Digital Research Collection!
