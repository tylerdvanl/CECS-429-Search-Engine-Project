    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Directions & Transportation     Getting Around     RVs and Trailered Vehicles                RVs and Vehicles with Trailers       The scenic roads of both the North and South Units of the park can accomodate large recreational vehicles and vehicles with trailers. However, there are sections of the road which are very narrow, have sharp curves, and\/or have steep grades. As such, operators of these vehicles must exercise caution while driving in the park. You are sharing the road with other motorists, bicyclists, pedestrians and wildlife. The pull-outs and overlooks along the park roads accomodate most vehicles, but please be aware there is no camping or staying overnight along the park road or at any of the visitor centers (including Painted Canyon). Visitors must stay in a designated camp site at the Cottonwood or Juniper Campgrounds. Both the campgrounds have a variety of back-in and pull-through sites which can accomodate most large vehicles. There is no maximum length, but some sites will work better than others, depending on the size of your vehicle. For more information on the amenities offered at our campgrounds, please check the camping section of our website. Many visitors with trailers or towed cars wish to unhook their rigs for an easier drive through the South Unit's scenic loop. These can be unhooked and left at the far (east) end of the South Unit Visitor Center parking lot.",
