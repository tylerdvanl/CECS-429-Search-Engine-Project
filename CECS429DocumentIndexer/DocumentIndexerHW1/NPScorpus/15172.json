Due to heavy snow, the Main Park Road opens as early as May 28th or as late as mid-July. Allow at least three hours to drive across the park and to make stops.Please remember that high-elevation roads are often icy or snow-covered during the fall and winter and can be very hazardous, especially when temperatures drop during the evening and early morning hours.The main park road that connects Highway 89 through the park is closed throughout winter, late fall, and most of spring. Visit the Current Conditions  page for up-to-date road closure status. The 17 Road (31N17 from Mineral to Viola), A-21, and other U.S. Forest Service and county roads close for the winter. Beginning in April, road clearing progress can be followed on the Spring Clearing page.Carry tire chains in your vehicle from October through May. Chain requirements can be instituted at any time; even four-wheel drive vehicles with snow tires can be required to chain up. Watch for highway advisories posted in Red Bluff and Redding. Caltrans will post chain requirements on Highways 36 and 44.To check for chain requirements, road closures, or other highway advisories before your trip, call the Caltrans Highway Information Network at 1-800-427-7623 or go to the Caltrans website at: http:\/\/www.dot.ca.gov\/hq\/roadinfoCaltrans also offers important tips for winter driving in snow country at: http:\/\/www.dot.ca.gov\/hq\/roadinfo\/wntrdriv.htm",
