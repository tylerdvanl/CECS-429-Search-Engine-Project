Volunteer Opportunities at Pea Ridge Volunteering is an American tradition that over the years has made an immeasurable contribution to communities, organizations and individuals throughout the country. A recent poll found that over one-third of the American public has been or is now a volunteer. Over half of those presently involved in volunteer work are also employed in full or part-time jobs. Today's volunteers are active, dynamic, creative individuals of all ages who possess the skills, desire, patience and time to accomplish a wide variety of tasks. Each year more than 85,000 volunteers donate more than 3,000,000 hours of service in the US national parks. There are no limits placed upon the amount of time a volunteer gives. You may give as much, or as little, as you wish. Some volunteer one or two days a month, while others work nearly full time. Volunteers are needed year-round and training is provided. No experience is necessary - only a desire to help preserve and protect America's natural and cultural heritage for the enjoyment of this and future generations.
