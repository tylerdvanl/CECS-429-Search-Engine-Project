Sycamore Canyon, which cuts through Rancho Sierra Vista\/Satwiwa and Point Mugu State Park, was part of a Chumash trade route. Satwiwa, which means \"the bluffs,\" was the name of a nearby Chumash village. To reflect this heritage, Satwiwa Native American Indian Culture Center and Natural Area was established by the National Park Service in partnership with the Friends of Satwiwa.   A Native American guest host or a park ranger is on hand to answer questions from 9am to 5pm on Saturdays and Sundays. Native American workshops, programs and art shows occur throughout the year.
