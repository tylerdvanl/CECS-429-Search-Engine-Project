Library of Congress  Colorful stories naturally emerge from any period in which armies meet and lives are lost. In that way the events that occurred in 1865 in the village and areas surrounding Appomattox Court House, Virginia are not much different. What is unique about many of the stories arising out of the early days of April 1865 in Appomattox are the lives that were saved and the new beginnings that were generated here in the days-- and years--after the historical surrender. Appomattox Court House NHP is a repository for many of these stories, some well known and many which might never otherwise have found a public audience. At the park you will have access to many of these stories through the Wall of Honor, our Living History program and other collections within the museum and the authentic village structures open for visitors to discover.",
