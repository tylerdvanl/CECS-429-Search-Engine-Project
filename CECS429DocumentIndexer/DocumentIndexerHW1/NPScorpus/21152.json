The program has three goals: • To engage children in learning about history and nature by participating in activities that enhance their national park experience • To extend the program’s reach to underserved audiences so that all parks can establish Junior Ranger programs • To develop and promote respect of, and appreciation for, our national treasures WebRangers: America’s parks offer an incredible experience full of wonder, history and excitement. But when you can’t be in a park, WebRangers (www.nps.gov\/webrangers), the online extension of the Junior Ranger Program, allows kids to have an interactive experience beyond the typical park visit. Re-launched in 2005, with support from the National Park Foundation, and Best Buy Children’s Foundation, WebRangers lets kids enjoy all kinds of activities—including animal quizzes, story writing and science experiments. The program encourages self-paced exploration resulting in a deep understanding of a place and an appetite to learn more. Junior Ranger Ambassadors: Sponsored by the National Park Foundation, the Junior Ranger Ambassadors program brings education and design students from colleges across the nation to help parks design, deliver and promote Junior Ranger programming. They focus on making the Junior Ranger activity booklets relevant and exciting, and on developing strategies to engage under-served audiences. This past summer, grants from the Foundation brought 30 Junior Ranger Ambassadors to parks across the country. Junior Rangers by the Numbers Electronic Field Trip Program The National Park Foundation is proud to work with the Electronic Field Trip Program (www.bsu.edu\/eft) at Ball State University (BSU) to connect school children with their national parks.
