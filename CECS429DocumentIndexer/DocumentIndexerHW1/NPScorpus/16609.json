    "body": "Frequently Asked Questions: West Thumb and Grant Village Area       Why is this area called West Thumb? Yellowstone Lake resembles the shape of a human hand; West Thumb is the large western bay that would be the thumb. The bay is a caldera within a caldera. It was formed by a volcanic eruption approximately 174,000 years ago. The resulting caldera later filled with water, forming an extension of Yellowstone Lake.  West Thumb is also the largest geyser basin on the shore of Yellowstone Lake—and its hydrothermal features lie under the lake too. The heat from these features can melt ice on the lake's surface. How did Fishing Cone get its name? People learned they could stand on this shoreside geyser, catch a fish in the cold lake, and cook it in the hot spring. Fortunately for anglers, this geyser has only two years of known eruptions: In 1919, it erupted frequently to 40 feet and in 1939 to lesser heights. Fishing here is now prohibited.  How hot are the springs at West Thumb? Temperatures vary from less than 100ºF (38ºC) to just over 200ºF (93ºC).  How deep are Abyss and Black pools? Abyss is about 53 feet deep; nearby Black Pool is 35–40 feet deep. The mudpots here aren't like they used to be. What happened? Like all hydrothermal features, the West Thumb Paint Pots change over time. During the 1970s and 1980s, they were less active; they became more active in the 1990s.  What happened to the development at West Thumb? Early visitors would arrive at West Thumb via stagecoach from the Old Faithful area. They could continue on the stagecoach or board the steamship \"Zillah\" to reach the Lake Hotel.  Later, a gas station, marina, photo shop, store, cafeteria, and cabins were built here. They were removed in the 1980s to protect the hydrothermal features and improve visitor experience. Grant Village now provides most of these facilities. West Thumb still has restrooms, picnic tables, and a bookstore and information station in the historic ranger station.  What can I do in the Grant Village and West Thumb area? This area provides numerous opportunities for adventure. Take in the spectacular views of West Thumb and the Absaroka Mountains from the shores of Yellowstone Lake. Explore the hot springs, mud pots, and geysers of the West Thumb Geyser Basin. Hike one of the local trails, like the Scenic Lake Overlook or begin an overnight backpacking excursion at one of the many wilderness trailheads. Also, private and commercial paddling excursions launch from the Grant Village Marina. Why does Grant Campground open so late in the year? Grizzly and black bears frequent this area in spring when cutthroat trout spawn in five nearby streams. To protect bears and people, the campground opens after most of the spawn is over.  Isn't there a unique lake nearby? That's Isa Lake, at Craig Pass. At one time, it was probably the only lake on Earth that drained naturally backwards to two oceans, the east side draining to the Pacific and the west side to the Atlantic. If this still occurs, it is only at the peak of snow melt after winters with deep snowfall.  What's that big lake you see south of Craig Pass? Shoshone Lake is the park's second largest lake, and is thought to be the largest lake in the lower 48 states that cannot be reached by road. Its maximum depth is 205 feet and it has an area of 8,050 acres. The Shoshone Geyser Basin contains one of the highest concentrations of geysers in the world—more than 80 in an area 1,600 x 800 feet.  What animals can I see in the West Thumb area? In addition to the bears that frequent this area in spring, elk cows and their new calves are often seen here in May and June. Bald eagles and osprey dive into the bay to catch cutthroat trout. Other birds include ravens, common loons, and bufflehead and goldeneye ducks.  In winter, pine marten are sometimes seen. River otters pop in and out of holes in the ice. Coyotes and bald eagles eat their fish scraps.      More Information   Explore West Thumb and Grant Village Area Basic Services Things To Do, including ranger programs, hiking, biking, skiing, guided tours, camping… Accessible Features in the West Thumb and Grant Village Area",
