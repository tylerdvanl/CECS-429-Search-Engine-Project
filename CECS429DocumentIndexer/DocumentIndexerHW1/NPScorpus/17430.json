    "body": "Channel Islands Live Distance Learning      Channel Islands Live programs engage students in learning about the marine and terrestrial ecosystems of the Channel Islands through activities that support the Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards. Activities focus on important practices used by scientists, such as asking questions and evaluating and communicating information. Students interact live with park rangers on Anacapa Island, a remote island off the southern California coast, during these presentations.   Live Dives are offered from underwater within one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world, the giant kelp forest. These programs focus on kelp forest ecology, marine protected areas, and scientific monitoring techniques.    Live Hikes are offered from scenic island overlooks and concentrate on American Indian culture and island isolation and biogeography.    These live programs are available on Wednesdays for interactive participation at your location and at the park visitor center in Ventura, California.     Scroll down for program descriptions.

As kelp forest inhabitants are encountered, students identify their roles as producers or consumers. Food chains are constructed and the transfer of energy is discussed. Effects of human activities on kelp forests are also explored.     1 2 3 4 5  Excellent Average: 5.0 (1 rating)   Type:Distance Learning Grade level:Sixth Grade Subjects:Biology: Animals, Biology: Plants, Conservation, Ecology, Environment, Marine Biology, Oceanography, Oceans National\/State Standards:NS 5‹8, C\/Life Sciences: Structure and function in living systems; F\/Science in Personal and Social Perspectives: Populations, resources, and environments Keywords:food chain, food web, producer, consumer, decomposer, photosynthesis, ocean, kelp forest, marine biology, oceans, islands, island        Channel Islands National Park Channel Islands Live Dive: High School    Students explore the kelp forest with a park ranger-diver through an interactive distance learning program. Program emphasis is on the park’s kelp forest inventory and monitoring program and the rationale for creation of marine protected areas (MPAs). Effects of human activities on kelp forests are also explored.

Students participate in a live, interactive visit with a park ranger on Anacapa Island to learn how humans use the natural resources around them to provide their basic needs. A program goal is for students to develop an appreciation and stewardship of the American Indian culture on the park islands while learning about their own connections to the past.

Students explore park ranger jobs through meeting a ranger in an interactive distance learning program. Students learn about job responsibilities by using objects from the ranger’s backpack as discussion prompts. Program was specially developed for classes reading Exploring Parks with Ranger Dockett in their Houghton Mifflin Harcourt language arts textbook. Can be adapted for other grade levels.
