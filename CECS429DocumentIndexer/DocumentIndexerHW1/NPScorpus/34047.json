    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Eating & Sleeping             Eating and Sleeping       Dining Options Ovations Restaurant and a picnic caterer offer a selection of food choices before Filene Center Performances. Concession stands are also open at the plaza area at Filene Center performances.  These services are not available for Children's Theatre-in-the-Woods performances, nor during the non-performance season.  Â    Picnic in the Park Pack your own picnic and find a spot in the park. Picnic tables are available throughout the park. Some are located near Wolf Trap Run, a small creek which flows through the park, and most tables are located in partly-shaded areas. Tables are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Keep in mind that no grilling or open flame is permitted in the park, nor are grills provided. For groups of 25 people or more, we ask that you contact the park at (703) 255-1827 for information on holding a large scale activity. Visit Public Use Limits page for further guidance.  If you have tickets for a Filene Center performance, picnics are also allowed on the lawn seating area of the Filene Center.",
