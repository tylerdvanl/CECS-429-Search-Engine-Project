The three Parkway campgrounds are free, primitive, and available on a first come, first serve basis.  They do not offer electricity, showers, or dump stations.  They are spread out along the Parkway: Rocky Springs (Milepost 54), Jeff Busby (Milepost 193.1) and Meriwether Lewis (Milepost 385).  Many of the other campgrounds along the Parkway corridor offer electricity, showers, and dump stations.  Check the complete updated list of all the campgrounds along the Parkway for the locations and services offered by private and public campgrounds.  Those who are biking the Parkway may be interested in the bicycle-only campgrounds along the Natchez Trace Parkway. Note:  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has banned the transport of firewood from some states to prevent the spread of highly destructive insects.",
