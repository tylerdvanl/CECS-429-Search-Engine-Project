This survey identified 85 species of birds, 62 of which were confirmed or suspected to be breeding in the park.  Previous records show that there are more than 100 species of birds at Saint-Gaudens NHS, including migrants.  Three species listed as endangered, according the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department, the Osprey, Northern Harrier, and Bald Eagle, have been sighted in the park while migrating through the area. The Pied-billed Grebe and the Grasshopper Sparrow, listed as threatened by the NH Fish and Game Department, have also been sighted within park boundaries.  Out of 100 species, only four have been introduced to the area, House Sparrow, European Starling, Ring-necked Pheasant, and Rock Dove.  Eighty-eight of the species in the park are nongame birds.  Twelve varieties of Warblers have been identified at Saint-Gaudens, including the Black-Throated Blue, Black-Throated Green, Canada, Chestnut-Sided, and Nashville which are considered rare birds by the New Hampshire Audubon Society.   The term “endangered species” means any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range other than a species determined to constitute a pest whose protection under the provisions would present an overwhelming and overriding risk to man.  The term “threatened species” means any species which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range.
