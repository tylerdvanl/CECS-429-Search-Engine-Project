Using the \"PassportTo Your National Parks\" is a great way to record your travels along the Ice Age NST or when you visit one of the Ice Age National Scientific Reserve Units. Each time you visit one of the locations listed below, take your passport book to the \"Cancellation Station\" typically found in the Visitor Center and ink stamp the date with the official cancellation. Oops! Ok, so you are in the Visitor Center and forgot your Passport? No worries. They should have “Oops, I forgot my passport” sheets of paper. Simply ink stamp the date on this and add it to your book in the future.
