All National Park Service jobs, both permanent and temporary, are announced on the USA JOBS website. Back to top            Permanent Employment Like you, many people have had the dream of becoming a park ranger. Because of this, the competition for permanent employment with the National Park Service (NPS) is intense and only a few jobs may be available. There are a number of ways to be hired for permanent positions. To access a listing of the current vacancies in the NPS, please visit USA JOBS. Listed below is a summary of how one may obtain a permanent position with the NPS: 1. If you are currently a permanent employee of the Federal Government in a competitive service position, you may apply directly to published vacancies. 2. If you were a permanent employee of the Federal Government and served for 3 or more years in a permanent position, you have reinstatement eligibility for your lifetime and can apply for any advertised vacancy issued by the NPS (note: some vacancies may restrict applicants to “agency only” or “local commuting area only”). You may also be appointed directly to a position without competition at or below the grade level or the highest grade ever held in a permanent position with similar duties. 3. If you were a permanent employee of the Federal Government and served for less than 3 years and are a veteran, you have reinstatement eligibility for your lifetime and have the same rights as listed in # 2. 4. If you were a permanent employee of the Federal Government and served for less than 3 years and are NOT a veteran, you have reinstatement eligibility for three years from the date of your resignation. This three year period can be extended by intervening periods of temporary employment with the Federal Government. You have the same rights as described in # 2 for the length of your reinstatement eligibility. 5. If you served in the Peace Corps for two years and are within one year from your resignation date, you have non-competitive eligibility for Federal employment and can apply directly to advertised vacancies. If you meet qualifications, you may be directly appointed to a permanent or temporary position. 6. If you are eligible under the Veteran Readjustment Authority (VRA), you many apply directly to NPS vacancy announcements up to grade GS-11 or the equivalent in the Federal Wage System. If you meet qualifications, you may be appointed to a position which requires a 2-year employment period that often includes a training program. At the end of the 2-year period of successful employment, you can be converted to a permanent position without further competition. 7. If you are eligible as a 30% disabled veteran, you are a non-competitive candidate and may apply directly to NPS vacancies. If you meet qualifications, you may be appointed directly to a temporary position and later converted to a permanent position provided performance is satisfactory and a permanent position is available. 8. If you are eligible under the physically handicapped program, you are a non-competitive candidate and may apply directly to NPS vacancies. If you meet the qualification standards, you may be appointed directly to a temporary position and after 2 years of successful employment be converted to a permanent position without further competition. 9. If you have outstanding scholarship (3.5+ GPA on a 4.0 scale) from an undergraduate program and are applying for positions in certain occupations, you may apply directly to NPS vacancies at grades GS-5 or GS-7. If you are found qualified, you may be appointed directly to a permanent position. 10. If you enter into a temporary appointment under the Student Career Experience Program (SCEP) and have completed the employment service requirements with a Federal agency, you have non-competitive eligibility for 120 days following your graduation and may apply directly to NPS vacancies. You may also be appointed directly to a permanent position without competition. 11. If you do NOT fit in any of the above programs, you are like the majority of the applicants for Federal positions and must compete for a permanent position. The NPS advertises permanent job openings via the Internet through the Office of Personnel Management’s website called USA JOBS. Once in the website you can do an agency search and under the Department of Interior find the current NPS job openings. In order to apply for a permanent position you must find a job announcement that is open to ALL QUALIFIED applicants. Back to top",
