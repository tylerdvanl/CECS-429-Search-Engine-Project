    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Operating Hours & Seasons              Operating Hours & Seasons          Kalaupapa National Historical Park is home to an active community of people, including patient-residents, and State and Federal employees.  Because it is still a living community, there are no opening or closing hours.  Visitation is restricted in accordance with Hawai'i State Law.  Access to the park will be denied to anyone that has not made prior arrangements and obtained necessary authorization.  The number of visitors allowed into the park is capped at 100 per day.  Persons wishing to access the park must prearrange their visit with Damien Tours (808.567.6171).  Damien Tours, owned and operated by a Kalaupapa resident, offers visitors tours of Kalaupapa and Kalawao.  Commercial tours operate Monday - Saturday, except Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day and New Years Day.    For those choosing not to visit the peninsula, the Kalaupapa Overlook from 'topside' Molokai at Pala'au State Park offers wayside interpretive exhibits for visitor learning.  The National Park Service does not offer any scheduled interpretive programs, activities, or provide visitor services because of the restricted nature of visitation to the park.  A bookstore is located in the Kalaupapa Settlement at the American of Japanese Ancestry (AJA) Buddhist Hall. There is no interpretive center at Kalaupapa. The park's cooperating association, Pacific Historic Parks  (PHP), provides interpretive, educational, and theme related items for sale at the Kalaupapa Bookstore. The bookstore has limited operating hours Monday - Saturday, and is closed Sundays. The AJA Hall\/Bookstore is one of the stops on the commercial tour. WARNING: There are no medical or dining facilities at Kalaupapa. The 3.5 mile trail to the park is extremely steep and challenging with uneven surfaces. Hiking the trail is physically demanding and careful consideration should be given to your physical fitness level before beginning the hike.",
