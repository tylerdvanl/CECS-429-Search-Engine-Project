Through the Challenge Cost Share Program, the National Park Service forms partnerships with many different groups to encourage research activities along the trail, and to achieve our collective goals to protect, preserve, and commemorate the history and properties associated with the Trail of Tears. A broad range of research topics are eligible for cost share funding. They could include: documenting a structure’s history and architectural fabric and design in anticipation of stabilization or preservation actions; studies of trail sites that may be eligible for certification or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places; general research into the trail’s history in a particular area that will contribute to an interpretive program there; and many others. Go to the links below to access completed research projects as listed by state. Trailwide research covers the entire trail through all of the states, including but not listed below: Kentucky. Many of these research documents are several megabytes LARGE so they will take some time to download. Alabama Arkansas Georgia Illinois Missouri North Carolina Oklahoma Tennessee Trailwide",
