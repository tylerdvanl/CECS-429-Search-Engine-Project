    "body": "Mercury Project          Mercury Sampling locally For the past six years, Woodstock Union and Stevens High Schools have joined  forces to collaboratively collect data and research Mercury (Hg) in our community. Three years ago, Hartford High School joined this effort to make this the largest contingency of student citizen scientists in the Upper Valley. The Twin State Mercury Monitoring Project, is funded by the National Park Foundation and supported by Dartmouth College, Toxic Metals Research Program.   >> CELEBRATE the students' hard work at DARTMOUTH COLLEGE HOPKINS CENTER FRIDAY JANUARY 8, at 7 p.m. with Marsh-Billings Rockefeller National Historical Park (MABI), and Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site (SAGA).   Rick Kendall, MABI & SAGA Superintendent, will kick off the event with a keynote address and then all are invited to view the student presentations, hear what they have learned and ask probing questions about mercury in our environment. <<          Click here to view 2014 posters     Woodstock Union High School Biology Teacher Jennifer Stainton, was recognized as 2013 Outstanding Biology Teacher of the Year, in part for her 9th grade science classes' study of mercury in the environment at the park.

Duration:5 minutes, 39 seconds                   How Mercury Enters the Environment US EPA  Nationally  \"Dragonfly larvae are currently being sampled for mercury levels in national parks. Mercury is a toxic pollutant that can harm human and wildlife health, threatening the natural resources the NPS is charged with protecting. The main source of human-caused mercury in remote national park environments is atmospheric deposition from coal-burning power plants.   National parks from Alaska to Florida and Maine to California are participating in the study. The data are available via the Citizen Scientists Study page link below. Ultimately, results will allow comparisons between parks, and will shed light on ecosystem health by characterizing the risk and potential transfer of mercury around food webs.\"  Read more details about the National Park Service's study: Citizen Scientists Study Mercury in Dragonfly Larvae  Link to the US Environmental Protection Agency's Mercury exposure pages.",
