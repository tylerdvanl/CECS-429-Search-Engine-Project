(NPS Photo)  Located along the transition from Virginia's piedmont region on its western side, to the coastal plain on its eastern side, the park's many units share an interesting combination of natural features. Each ecosystem found at Richmond National Battlefield Park, including wetlands, forests and grasslands, creates habitat for its own suite of plants and animals. However, when combined, the park's variety of ecosystem types, as well as the transition zones between them, further increase the diversity of native communities. Careful management and preservation of these natural resources will ensure that visitors will be able to experience this variety of diverse habitats at Richmond National Battlefield Park for generations to come.
