Roanhorse 5 September, 2013.          Swamp Canyon appears relatively small and sheltered from the overlook, bounded on both sides by fins and hoodoos. This size allows the viewer to develop a more intimate connection with the landscape than some of the grander viewpoints may provide.   From the Swamp Canyon overlook, hikers can descend to either side of the prominence on a trail that will connect with the Under the Rim Trail and then return on the other side, making a loop. We recommend going clockwise.    Though a moderate hike, this trail can be difficult if not prepared. Please carry plenty of water, snacks and appropriate wilderness trek items.     Good map\/land navigation skills is recommended.  Wilderness area, you will encounter wildlife i.e. bees, wasp, deer and maybe bears, mountain lions. Stay on the trail.
