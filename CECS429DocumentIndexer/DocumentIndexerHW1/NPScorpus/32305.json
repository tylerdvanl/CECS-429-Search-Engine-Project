    "body": "Mammals         Many mule deer live at the park, though they tend to avoid visitors, so are not often seen. NPS  Mammals The most abundant species are deer mice and montane voles. Other common mammals include pocket gophers, whitetail deer, mule deer,and Columbian ground squirrels. Seen occasionally are beavers, mink, river otters, muskrats, raccoons, weasels, skunks, badgers, porcupines, and coyotes.        Opossums are nocturnal. While most visitors won't actually see one, they do live in the park. NPS  New and Introduced Mammals Whitman Mission supports several introduced species of mammals. The Virginia opossum, eastern cottontail, and eastern gray squirrel all occur at the site.The eastern gray squirrel has only recently become established here. Staff first reported seeing it at the site in 2002. It apparently spread west from the city of Walla Walla, where it has been established for many years.      Unexpected Mammals The last few years have seen more and more sightings of Moose in the Walla Walla area. Moose have occasionally been spotted at Whitman Mission.       Moose wading in the park's Mill Pond.
