    "body": "Timeline of the Elwha Through 1940       25,000-10,000 years ago: The Fraser glaciation occurs and upon receding, the Elwha watershed is created.  Until late 1800's: The Klallam and other tribes inhabit a great deal of the northern Olympic coast and the mouth of the Elwha River, fishing, hunting, clamming and harvesting the lands.  Late 1800's: Port Angeles begins to grow as European-American homesteaders arrive and settle the peninsula.  1910: With financial backing of the Olympic Power Company created by Thomas Aldwell and investors, construction of Elwha Dam begins.  1912: First gravity dam blows as the reservoir fills. Thomas Aldwell receives more funding to rebuild dam.  1913: Elwha Dam becomes operational. Despite an 1890 state law requiring \"fish passage wherever food fish are wont to ascend,\" the dam operates without providing for fish passage. 1915: When Washington State Fish Commissioner Leslie Darwin offers to waive the fish passage requirement, Aldwell constructs a hatchery adjoining the Elwha Dam. It was abandoned by the state in 1922.  1925: Construction on Glines Canyon dam begins at river mile 13.   1927: Glines Canyon Dam becomes operational. No method of fish passage is provided.  1935: U.S. Representative Monrad C. Wallgren sponsors a bill for the establishment of a national park on the Olympic Peninsula.  1937: President Franklin D. Roosevelt's visit to the area in the fall seals the effort for those pushing for establishment of Olympic National Park.  1938: Congress passes Rep. Wallgren's bill, and with the President's signature, 634,000 acres is designated as Olympic National Park on June 29, 1938. Elwha 1940 – 1992 Elwha 1992 – 2010",
