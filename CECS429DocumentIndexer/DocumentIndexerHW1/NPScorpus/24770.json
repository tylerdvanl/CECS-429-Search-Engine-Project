NPS   Â     Voices of the Wilderness: An Artist in Residence Program The Voices of the Wilderness artist residency is a unique opportunity for Glacier Bay and artists to collaborate. Like many traditional residencies, artists will have an opportunity to experience Glacier Bay's wilderness. However, participating artists will also work with park rangers and actively engage in stewardship projects. The exact nature of the projects will depend on what is happening at the park, but could include helping with a children's art program, assisting park researchers, or helping with monitoring projects. such as research, monitoring, and education. The idea is to give artists a sense of the stewardship behind America's public lands, to foster an artistic exploration of these natural and cultural treasures. The desired result is artwork that communicates some of the meaning of this special public land.  Learn more about the program.  Apply by March 1, 2015.",
