Settlers arriving from England cursed the insects that plagued their new home. Modern day visitors should be prepared for insects by bringing appropriate clothing and\/or insect repellant. Biting Flies: also called \"yellow flies\" or \"deerflies\", are most active in late spring, and appear again in August. Chiggers: are small red mites. Chigger \"cures\" are ineffective because the bug is gone before the itching begins. Chiggers live inside spanish moss. Avoid chiggers by avoiding spanish moss. Mosquitos: certain mosquitos can be vectors of disease. Wearing repellant with DEET will reduce the chances of being bite. Sand Gnats: the tiny sand gnat (also called the \"sand fly\" or \"no see-um\") appears in large numbers during mild temperatures. Ticks: There are many species of ticks in the Frederica area. Wearing insect repellant, tucking pants into socks, and inspecting for ticks after a visit is recommended.",
