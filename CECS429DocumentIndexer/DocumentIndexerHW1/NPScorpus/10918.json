    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Fees & Passes              Fees & Passes          Â   No admission fees are charged to visit the Heritage Corridor or to attend most of the regular programs offered by the Park Service rangers. Fees are often collected at the other privately owned and operated sites by self supporting associations working cooperatively with the park. These sites rely on admission fees as they do not receive federal funding for operations and therefore do not accept the National Parks Pass for admission. For more information about fees charged at Partner Sites, please check their websites which can be found at the links below. Things To DoIf you plan to visit other parks with an entrance fee, learn more about the America the Beautiful - The National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass series.Also, learn about Fee Free Days at National Parks and other federally owned sites.",
