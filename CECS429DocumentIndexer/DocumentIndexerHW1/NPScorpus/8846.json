This travelogue includes color-coded maps, pre-visit information, illustrations and photographs. It includes a list of every national park area in the United States.   Spaces allow you to collect the series of commemorative Passport stamps issued each year. Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore was featured on the 1988 set of Passport Stamps.  The Passport program began in 1986 by Eastern National to help visitors discover the beauty and history found in America’s national parks. Cancellation stamps can be found at most national park areas. These rubber-stamp ink markings record the name of the park and the date of your visit.       Passport Stamp Locations  Interagency Visitor Center (open year-round) Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore - Munising North Country National Scenic Trail  Munising Falls Visitor Center (summer only) Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore - Munising Falls  Miners Castle Information Center (summer only) Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore - Miners Castle  Au Sable Light Station (summer only) Au Sable Light Station - Grand Marais  Grand Sable Visitor Center (summer only) Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore - Grand Sable Visitor Center  North Country National Scenic Trail  Park Headquarters (open year round) Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore - Munising",
