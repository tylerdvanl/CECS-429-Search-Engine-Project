    "body": "Exit Glacier Area         A moderately strenuous trail leads up to the edge of Exit Glacier NPS \/ Fiona Ritter   The Exit Glacier area is the only part of the park accessible by road.  Here you can explore the trails, walk very close to an active glacier, or take a ranger-led walk.  It is a place where you can witness up close how glaciers re-shape a landscape and learn how plant life reclaims the barren rocky land exposed by a glacier's retreat.      Directions to Exit Glacier Turn on to Herman Leirer Road, commonly called \"Exit Glacier Road,\" at mile 3 of the Seward Highway (AK-9). Proceed 8.4 miles. The road will end at the parking lot for the nature center.   There is limited parking at Exit Glacier, especially during the hours of 10:30-3:30. Please consider the hours you come, carpooling, or taking a shuttle or taxi, when you plan your trip.

Snowcoach Service: For transportation in the winter months.          Trails A network of short trails leads to different views of Exit Glacier, beginning at the Exit Glacier Nature Center and the parking lot. Start by turning left at the nature center and following the accessible trail through the cottonwood forest to the Glacier View, a panoramic vista of Exit Glacier spilling down from the Harding Icefield. This one-mile accessible trail loops back to the parking area, but if you turn left at the trail-side kiosk you can continue on toward the Toe of the Glacier and the Edge of the Glacier.   Getting to the Toe of the Glacier requires crossing the rocky outwash plain. This area may be not be accessible due to frequent floods and there is no set trail across the plain. If water levels are low, you can make your way to the terminus or toe, but don't approach the glacier in places where the ice is over your head. Huge, heavy chunks of ice can fall off without warning.   There is a well maintained trail to the Edge of the Glacier. This moderately strenuous trail brings you near a wall of blue ice providing the most dramatic close up view of Exit Glacier.   If you are looking for a longer day hike, don't miss the Harding Icefield Trail.             (PDF - 1.86 MB)   Trail Maps of Exit Glacier Area Official Exit Glacier map - from park brochure\/map.
