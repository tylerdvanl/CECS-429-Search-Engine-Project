    "body": "Explore This Park    Get Involved     Planning     Public Access     Plan for Public Access                Chesapeake Watershed Public Access Plan       Through Executive Order 13508, President Obama asked federal agencies to develop a strategy for protecting and restoring the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The executive order called for the National Park Service, in conjunction with watershed states, to \"develop a public access plan to inform and guide expansion of Chesapeake watershed public access.\" The resulting Chesapeake Bay Watershed Public Access Plan was produced by a Public Access Action Team, which includes people involved in public access planning and implementation in each of the Chesapeake watershed states and the District of Columbia and the National Park Service. In a series of meetings, and through an online process, the public participated in identifying existing sites and suggested potential sites. The public access plan: Summarizes the demand for public access in the Chesapeake watershed Outlines the process, steps, and definitions used for developing this plan Establishes the baseline of existing public access sites Depicts specific potential public access sites that could be developed in the future, as well as areas and stretches requiring additional attention Describes planning challenges to be considered in adding new access sites Summarizes findings and sets out next steps for implementing the plan and increasing access Questions about the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Public Access Plan can be directed to John Davy.
