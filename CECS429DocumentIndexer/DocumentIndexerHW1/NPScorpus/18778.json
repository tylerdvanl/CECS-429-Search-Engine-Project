    "body": "Explore This Park    Get Involved     Do Business With Us     Special Use Permits (Filming, Weddings, Scattering Ashes, Access)              Special Use Permits        Updated July 24, 2016 The Special Park Use Permits (SPU) authorizes activities that benefit an individual, group or organization, rather than the public at large: and that require written authorization and management control in order to protect park resources and the public interest.  Examples include weddings, scattering of ashes, commercial filming and\/or photography, First Amendment activities, athletic and other special events, collecting resource materials, and commercial vehicle access to \"Science City\". Applications for Special Park Use Permits MUST be received by the park no less than two weeks prior to your proposed event date. The only exception to this is for First Amendment activities. Do allow at least two days for processing of these permits.  Any commercial activity, other than commercial filming\/photography, requires a Commercial Use Authorization (CUA).      Commercial Filming\/Photography Commercial filming and photography is defined as digital or film recording of a visual image, or sound recording, by a person, business, or other entity for a market audience, such as for a documentary, television or feature film, advertisement, or similar project. Under Public Law 106-206 all commercial filming and photography requires a permit and is subject to a location fee and cost recovery. In Public Law 106-206, Congress expressed the importance of resource protection and directed that the permit request should be denied if:  there is the likelihood that resource damage would occur that cannot be mitigated or restored under the terms and conditions of a permit;  there is the likelihood of unreasonable disruption of or conflict with the public’s use\/enjoyment of the site;  there is the likelihood that the activity poses health or safety risks to the public;  there is the likelihood that the activity would result in the impairment of park resources or values; or  the required activity would violate any other applicable Federal, State, or local law or regulation. If the project is such that it is indistinguishable from the activity of the average visitor, a permit may not be required. If this might pertain to your project, please contact the Permits Coordinator at 808-572-4440 to discuss. Permits are NOT generally required for:  Visitors engaged in filming\/photography intended for their personal use and enjoyment. The filming of breaking news (an event that cannot be covered at any other time or location) by news crews. Filming that is conducted pursuant to a cooperative agreement or contract with the National Park Service.  Wilderness: The wilderness area of Haleakalā National Park encompasses 24,719 acres and countless microclimates. Only educational filming is permitted within Wilderness areas. Timeline: Due to ever-changing workloads, we must receive your application and application fee no less than two weeks prior to the start of your proposed activity. Requests that are complex in nature or requests to film in the wilderness area or in closed areas will require, at a minimum, four weeks to process as they must be reviewed for environmental and cultural compliance. Once an application is approved, a permit will be written and the permittee will have to review and sign it confirming their intent to adhere to all permit conditions. Once the permittee has signed the permit, the Park Superintendent will authorize the permit with his\/her signature.
