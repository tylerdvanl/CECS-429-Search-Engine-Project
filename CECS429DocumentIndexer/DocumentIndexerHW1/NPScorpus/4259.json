Biscayne National Park consists of four primary ecosystems:  a narrow fringe of mangrove forest along the mainland shoreline; the southern expanse of Biscayne Bay; the northernmost islands of the Florida Keys; and the beginning of the third-largest coral reef in the world.  Each of these ecosystems is comprised of a variety of smaller communities like seagrass meadows, hardbottom areas and hardwood hammocks. The geology of the area has been influenced by changing sea levels, currents, hurricanes, and reef-building organisms like corals. South Florida's subtropical climate produces forest types that are more typical of the Caribbean than of mainland North America.
