Two federally Threatened anadromous fish species, spring-run chinook salmon and Central Valley (Evolutionary Significant Unit) steelhead trout, spawn in portions of lower Clear Creek below Whiskeytown Dam. These species are closely monitored by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  In order to maintain recreational opportunities, the California Department of Fish and Game regularly stocks rainbow trout and brook trout in the lake and some perennial streams during the spring and summer months. Historically, brown trout and kokanee salmon were also stocked in the lake and can still be found there today.  Download Whiskeytown's fish list (pdf, 41K).",
