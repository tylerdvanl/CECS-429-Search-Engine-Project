Tunnels are an iconic feature of the Parkway, with 36% of all NPS road tunnels found here. There are twenty-five Parkway tunnels in North Carolina and one in Virginia. These tunnels are listed below by milepost, length, maximum height (over the center of the road), and minimum height (over the edge of the road).
