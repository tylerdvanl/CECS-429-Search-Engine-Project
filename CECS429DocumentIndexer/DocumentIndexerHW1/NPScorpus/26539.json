Myrah, Artist, Catalog No. FOCL 698  Prior to the establishment of Lewis and Clark National Historical Park, archeological investigations related to the search for the location of the 1805-1806 Fort Clatsop, and the activities of the Lewis and Clark expedition, were a continuing theme in the development of the museum collections for the park. Research and compliance activities within the park have added materials related to Native American Tribes in the area, early settlement and development, and historic transportation. Archeological materials currently comprise 17% of the park’s museum collections. There are no museum objects within the collections that can be positively associated with the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Most of the historic objects are representative artifacts from the time period, replicas of historic artifacts for exhibit, or historic objects related to the establishment and expansion of the park. The historic collection accounts for approximately 2% of the park collection.       Makah Canoe        The ethnological collection documents the material culture of the Clatsop and Nehalem Tribes of Oregon, the Chinook tribe of Washington State, and other tribal groups on the Columbia River.
