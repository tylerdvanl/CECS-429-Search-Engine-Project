NPS Photo by Sheena Grabski        During the winter, there may be an opportunity to go on a ranger-guided snowshoe hike. Please call for more details or for current conditions, call the Monument at 748-3253.        Use your snowshoes to explore Florissant Fossil Beds.  Snowshoes available for use if you are attending a ranger-led hike.    When there is enough snow, Florissant Fossil Beds' gentle meadows, hills, and trails can be a great place to snowshoe or cross-country ski.     The Monument does not have any equipment available, so please bring your own snowshoes or cross-country skis.         Aspens make great photography subjects during the winter at Florissant Fossil Beds.
