These three locations are dispersed through east-central Oregon, and visiting all three units is difficult to do in a single day, but is possible with an early start. This John Day Camping & Services Map shows the three units and the local highways (updated in October 2014) includes campgrounds, services, and certain travel information as well as GPS addresses for the three units of the monument.  Please note that some services shown on the map above may not be open 7 days\/wk so check with the local chambers of commerce for updated information.  Â       The amount of time visitors have available and the route of travel they take through the area often are the determining factors on which unit(s) they visit.",
