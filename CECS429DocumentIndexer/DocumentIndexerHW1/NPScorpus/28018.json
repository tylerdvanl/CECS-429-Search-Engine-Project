Workshops are held at the Obed Visitor Center, and run from 5:00-7:00 p.m. (ET). Travis Gosnell built his first bow as a child and has always enjoyed a good challenge. He says, \"At times, it (bow building) is a kind of therapy from the rat race of life.\"    Travis has a Bachelor's Degree in History and Political Science from Tennessee Technological University, and has worked a variety of jobs before becoming a teacher at Wartburg Middle School. He enjoys hunting, fishing, American Indian archeology, and World War II history. Travis is now excited about the opportunity to pass on his passion for primitive weaponry to others.       The workshop is wheelchair accessible. Visitors will have the opportunity to help in the process of building a primitive bow and ask Travis questions about other primitive weapons.   For more information regarding the next scheduled workshop, please contact the visitor center at (423) 346-6294.",
