Ride the shuttle to the Temple of Sinawava, walk 1 mile to the end of the paved Riverside Walk, and begin wading up the river. There is no formal destination, and you return the same way you came. Many hikers try to reach Orderville Canyon, a tributary creek approximately two hours upstream from the end of the paved trail (2.5 miles from the shuttle stop).  Travel upstream into Orderville Canyon or beyond Big Spring is prohibited. It is 2.5 miles upstream from Orderville to Big Spring, making the roundtrip hike up to Big Spring and back to the shuttle stop 10 miles. No permit is required for this day hike. Group size limits (12 people per group) do apply beyond the junction with Orderville Canyon. Please remember to use the restroom at the Temple of Sinawava before starting your hike; there are none in The Narrows.  Â         Top Down Narrows Hike",
