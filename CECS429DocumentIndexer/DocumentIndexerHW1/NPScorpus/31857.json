In 1970 the property was sold to private developers who planned to build on the land. Concerned that the development would damage a valuable historic asset, local citizens organized a drive to preserve the site. This sparked interest in establishing a national memorial. In May 1977 President Jimmy Carter signed the bill creating the Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site, \"in order to commemorate for the education, inspiration, and benefit of present and future generations the life and work of an outstanding woman in American History.\" Donations You can help support the National Park Service and the Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site through a number of avenues.
