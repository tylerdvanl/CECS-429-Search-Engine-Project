You may also find great ideas for projects and research papers. Remember to include a notation for the source of this information. These \"Fun Facts\" were created and published on the Rocky Mountain National Park website a few years ago. They were updated in 2007.  The original idea was that each topic would provide a bit of information and some attractive pictures about a natural history topic, an answer to the \"burning question of the week,\" or an event in the park. We have specifically tried to size some of the more attractive large photos to be made into wallpaper for your computer screen (by right clicking on the picture and selecting \"Set as background\"). As a result, we hope you find these Fun Facts informative and useful.
