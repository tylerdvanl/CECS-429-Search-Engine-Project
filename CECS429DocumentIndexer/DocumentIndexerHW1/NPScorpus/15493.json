    "body": "Horseback Riding       The Glenwood Dunes Trail system is the National Lakeshore's only equestrian trail. Horseback riding is permitted on the specified portion of the Glenwood Dunes Trail from March 16 - December 14. However, if there is sufficient snow cover for cross-country skiing (3 inches or more) before December 15 or after March 15, the trail will remain closed to horseback riding. Horses are prohibited in the winter to prevent accidents with cross-country skiers on the trail.  The parking lot is large enough for horse trailers. In the parking lot and picnic area, all horse excrement must be bagged, removed from the area and disposed of appropriately. There is no horse rental concession. Horses are prohibited on all roads.
