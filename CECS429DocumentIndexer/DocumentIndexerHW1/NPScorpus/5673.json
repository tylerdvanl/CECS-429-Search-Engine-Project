    "body": "Commercial Services Operator Training       Once a commercial operator receives a permit to operate at Big Cypress National Preserve, the owner and guides will be required to attend training provided by Big Cypress staff and others. Training for operators consists of:  Two full days of training on-site at Big Cypress National Preserve - 1.25 days inside and .75 day field trip. Field trips will be specific to permitted activity Operators will also be required to participate in three additional documented training opportunities throughout the year, to be selected from a list provided by the National Park Service to the operator.  Examples: Rookery Bay Ecotour operator workshops, Florida Master Naturalist Program, Big Cypress seasonal employee interpretation training, Big Cypress National Preserve invitational \"Lunch and Learn\" sessions, Preserve scheduled interpretive programs, Online opportunities, such as those provided on www.eppley.org Other training opportunities not on the list can be submitted to Big Cypress for approval, but must be approved in advance, in order to be accepted to meet requirements for training. Our intention is to provide as many opportunities to get National Park Service approved training as possible, and providing it to as many commercial operator staff as possible. The training is mandatory for the owners and managers of commercial operations, and since the operator will be required to provide training to meet NPS standards, we will try to \"catch\" the guides as they arrive for the season.",
