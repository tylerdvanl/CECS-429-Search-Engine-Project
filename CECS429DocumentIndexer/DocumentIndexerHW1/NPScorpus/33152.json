For a century the American people have entrusted the NPS to tell the nation's stories and protect its historic, natural, and recreation features, and to preserve the parks so they may be enjoyed by future generations. In this centennial year, you are invited to both celebrate this milestone anniversary and to become part of the next generation of park stewards.  See the Calendar for events celebrating the NPS Centennial. Help the national parks look forward to the next century. This is not the end of a century, but the beginning of the next 100 years!
