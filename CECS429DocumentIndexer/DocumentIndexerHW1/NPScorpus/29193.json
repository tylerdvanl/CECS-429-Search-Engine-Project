A weblog is a journal (or newsletter) that is frequently updated and intended for general public consumption. Blogs generally represent the personality of the author or the Web site. Blogs often focus on a particular subject, such as food, sports, or local news. Some blogs function as online diaries. A typical blog may combine text, images, and links to other blogs, Web pages, and other media related to its topic. Chickasaw's Blogs We want to keep you connected with what is happening in the park.
