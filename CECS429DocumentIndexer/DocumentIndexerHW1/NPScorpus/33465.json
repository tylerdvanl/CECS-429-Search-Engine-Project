Application Hints  We look at all of your experience and education so be sure to include any volunteer work you do. Ensure that you give the month and year you began and ended each job and make sure you put in the amount of hours per week you worked. We are required to perform qualifications based on a 40-hour week and any part of that would be pro-rated towards experience requirements. (For example: you may need one year of experience for a particular job. You worked at a similar job for 12 months working 40 hours per week. You would be qualified. If you worked at that same job for 12 months but worked 20 hours per week, then you would receive credit for 6 months experience.) Make sure you list your relevant experience. Add additional pages if needed. There is no \"appropriate\" amount of time to go back in your experience. Do not include extraneous materials. Read the vacancy announcement and provide what is requested. The National Park Service is an Equal Opportunity employer.
