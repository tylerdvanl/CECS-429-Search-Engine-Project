Once you have explored these pages, contact us via the park information line (970-562-4282) or via email if you have further questions regarding your trip logistics. Travel By Bus Large vehicles like school buses or rental coaches can drive to the visitor center, from which the Square Tower Ruin trail is easily accessible. All roads to the outlying units are dirt and not maintained regularly. High-clearance vehicles are recommended for visiting these sites. Attend a Ranger Program Spring through fall, short porch and overlook talks and evening campground programs are offered to the public on a regular schedule, and visiting school groups may join any of these programs. Private guided walks or talks can also be arranged for larger groups; please contact the park well in advance. Hike a Trail Non-commercial educational groups may hike together on all park trails. For groups larger than ~20 people, breaking into smaller groups is appreciated by other hikers. Stay in the Campground A small campground near the visitor center is open year-round on a first-come\/first-served basis. Campsites cost $10 per night, and entrance fee waivers do not affect camping fees. More...",
