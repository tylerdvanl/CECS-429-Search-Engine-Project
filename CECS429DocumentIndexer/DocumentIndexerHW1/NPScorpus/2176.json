Â       This one-story, rambling adobe-block home was built in a Southwestern, New Mexican colonialist style. It includes ponderosa pine-log viga ceilings, wood-plank window and door framing, and a tongue-in-groove wooden floor throughout. The floor plan resembles Juan Lorenzo Hubbell's boyhood home in the South Valley of Albuquerque, New Mexico.
