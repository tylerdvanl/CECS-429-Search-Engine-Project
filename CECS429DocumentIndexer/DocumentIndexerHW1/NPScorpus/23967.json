Carlsbad Caverns National Park offers numerous ranger-guided cave tours into areas other than the self-guided routes. Find out which tour is right for you by clicking on the tour name below. The ranger-guided cave tours require an additional ticket and can be purchased in advance. If you reserve a spot on the Slaughter Canyon Cave or Spider Cave trip you must caravan in your own vehicle to the trailhead after meeting at the visitor center at least 15 minutes before the tour. Participants on guided tours (except King's Palace and Left Hand Tunnel) must bring 3-AA batteries with them. Gloves, knee and elbow pads will be provided if crawling is required on a tour. We provide required equipment to minimize the risk of transferring White Nose Syndrome from another cave. NOTE: Children younger than 4 years are not permitted on any ranger-guided cave tours. Additional age limits differ for each tour. Availability on all ranger-guided tours is limited so plan ahead and reserve early. Make tour reservations by calling 1.877.444.6777 or by visiting www.recreation.gov. You must pick up your tickets in the visitor center.        Carlsbad Caverns National Park is closed on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's Days.
