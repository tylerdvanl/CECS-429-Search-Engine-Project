During the breeding season, this small island, only 16 acres in size, is home to birds not found elsewhere in the continental United States. Once the nesting wildlife have vacated Bush Key, visitors are invited to take a stroll along the shoreline of this uninhabited island. When Bush Key is open, visitors are welcome to walk the out and back on the 1 mile round trip shoreline trail from sunrise to sunset. To preserve a tranquil visitor experience and protect the fragile plant life, we require visitors to stay on the trail.   Bush Key closes every year around February to September, when up to 80,000 sooty terns and 4,500 brown noddies make nests and raise their young on the island.  This is the only significant breeding colonies of sooty terns and brown noddies in the United States.    Due to the dynamic landscape and shifting sands, at times Bush Key is accessible to Garden Key via a land bridge, at other times Bush Key is only accessible via kayak or canoe.
