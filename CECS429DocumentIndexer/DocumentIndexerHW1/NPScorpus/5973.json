    "body": "Explore This Park    Learn About the Park     Nature     Plants               Plants          More than 250 species of plants are found on the battlefield’s landscape, several of which have been identified as state threatened and watch list species. These include such species as Short’s Rockcress, Harbinger of Spring, and Dwarf Larkspur. If you come to visit us in the spring and follow some of our nature trials you may be lucky enough to view the beautiful Virginia Bluebells, Spring Beauty, Yellow Trout Lily, and Black Eyed Susan. Throughout the park there are a number of trees which are referred to as “witness” trees, or trees that were present at the time of the battle. The natural resources staff also periodically performs tree surveys to measure large trees in the park, to determine their age, and to monitor their overall health over time.",
