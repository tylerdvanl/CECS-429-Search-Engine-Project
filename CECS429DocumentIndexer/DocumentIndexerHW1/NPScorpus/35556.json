Programs that link Zion resources to student learning objectives may include PowerPoint presentations, games, discussions, and\/or activities. Pre-arrival packets containing pre- and post-visit activities are located on the Curriculum Materials page. All programs are between 45 to 60 minutes long. Program details, scheduling, and the registration form are located on the Outreach Registration page.    Special Requests – In the Classroom   A park ranger will visit your K - 12 class to teach students about the natural or cultural resources relevant to Zion. Programs are typically one-hour in length, during the fall and spring, and we strive to address multiple curriculum standards that promote connections to our national parks.    Special Requests – In the Park If your class is planning a field trip to Zion, rangers may be available, based on staffing, to present an orientation or topic-based presentation to your group before you explore the park. Talks are usually 20 to 30 minutes long and typically held at the South Campground Ampitheater. Topics include human and park history, plant and animal adaptations, hydrology, geology, and ecology. For more information on any of these programs, contact the Education Coordinator at 435-772-0165.",
