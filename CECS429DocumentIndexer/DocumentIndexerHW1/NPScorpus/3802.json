Game trails and some old mining trails do provide limited hiking opportunities. Most people find summer hiking best above timberline (3000'-3500') since there are fewer insects, less brush and improved vistas allowing for less chance of surprising or being surprised by wildlife. Historic mail trail areas do provide the oppportunity to hike, but fires during the 1999 and 2002 fire seasons have severely limited their use as easy and enjoyable hiking areas. As is prudent with any outdoor experience, always leave a trip plan with a friend or family member to help insure your safety. The Eagle Visitor Center staff will be happy to file a backcountry hiking plan for you to help add to the level of security for your trip, but always remember that in the backcountry you must be self sufficient. Carry plenty of water. Satellite phones and GPS units are often quite helpful in the backcountry.",
