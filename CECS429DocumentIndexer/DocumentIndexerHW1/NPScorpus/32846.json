Although a scenic and adventurous cycling trip, special road conditions require additional attention. This webpage provides tips for an enjoyable and safe pedal along this beautiful route. You can also download a handout (PDF) of this page and additional safety information.  SAFETY CONCERNS  Rocks Amazing geologic scenery can be beautiful as well as threatening. Make sure to watch out for rolling rocks along the way, especially along steep cliffs. Ride to the inside of rock falls if possible to keep from going into traffic.  Traffic Because bicyclists will be sharing the road with motorized park visitors, special considerations must be made for road travel. Use caution with blind corners and hills. Although the shoulder line separates the bicyclist's path from that of the motorist, both motorists and bicyclists can cross these lines at anytime. Stay alert and make yourself visible with head and tail lights, and reflective clothing.  Tunnels Between the towns of Newhalem and Diablo there are two tunnels. The longer of the two, closer to Newhalem, is fitted with a \"BIKES IN TUNNEL\" flashing safety light that can be turned on at either end. Before entering the tunnel, turn on all head and tail lights. There may be rocks inside the tunnel which have dislodged from the tunnel walls. Be prepared for safe maneuvering. Reduced road space can force cars and bikes together.  Other Bicyclists You will also be sharing the road with other cyclists. Know the correct hand signals and areas of possible bike traffic. Think ahead and know what to do if you do meet other cyclists. Be comfortable with explaining to others what it takes to make it a safe trip.          Cycling route on the North Cascades Highway.  (click for cycling map and guide) NPS\/NOCA       MILEAGE GUIDE Milepost (MP) 105.3: North Cascades National Park Wilderness Office (1 mi down Ranger Station Road): INFORMATION MP 106: (elev. 358') Town of Marblemount: FOOD, PHONE, BIKE SUPPLIES (limited).
