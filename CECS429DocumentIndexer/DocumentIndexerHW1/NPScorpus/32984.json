The park, with its abundant rainfall and snowy mountains, hundreds of lakes and streams, 10 major rivers and the Pacific Ocean, provides habitat for 37 species of native fish. Unique Fish Besides salmon that may travel thousands of miles during their lifetimes, the park also has freshwater fish that spend their whole lives isolated in their home lakes. The tiny Olympic mud minnow of lowland lakes is found nowhere else in the world. The Beardslee and Crescenti trout isolated in Lake Crescent are genetically distinct from their rainbow and cutthroat ancestors. Interested in fishing Olympic National Park waters?
