NPS \/ R. Cammauf  The South Florida Natural Resources Center conducts monitoring of freshwater fishes and invertebrates in several habitat types within Everglades National Park. Shark River Slough, a deep-water habitat, is sampled intensively once per year, whereas the Rocky Glades at the eastern edge of the park are sampled monthly. This monitoring program tracks seasonal and long-term changes in freshwater fish and invertebrate populations that arise from natural weather patterns and changes in water management. The program has also documented the invasion of park waters by several species of exotic aquarium fish, including the highly invasive jewel cichlid.",
