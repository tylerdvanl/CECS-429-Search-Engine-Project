    "body": "Where Mountains, Ice, and Ocean Meet  At the edge of the Kenai Peninsula lies a land where the ice age lingers. Nearly 40 glaciers flow from the Harding Icefield, Kenai Fjords' crowning feature. Wildlife thrives in icy waters and lush forests around this vast expanse of ice. Native Alutiiq relied on these resources to nurture a life entwined with the sea. Today, shrinking glaciers bear witness to the effects of our changing climate.                Attend A Ranger-led Program   Join a park ranger for a short walk, interpretive talk, or a day hike and learn more about your park.         Explore The Fjords On a Boat Tour   Boat tours depart Seward's small boat harbor daily during the summer months, making it easy to travel deeper into the park.               Kayaking in Kenai Fjords   Kayaking in Kenai Fjords can be an exciting way to explore the fjords, see glaciers, and view wildlife.
