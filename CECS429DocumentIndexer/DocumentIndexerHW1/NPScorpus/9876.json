    "body": "Quincy Mine Office        From the Quincy Mine Office located along U.S. Highway 41, administrators oversaw daily operations. NPS Photo, Dan Johnson.   Â    In the late 1800s and early 1900s, administrators of the successful Quincy Mining Company occupied this stately Jacobsville sandstone building. Today, its office spaces are leased to private enterprises. Future plans call for both an interior and exterior restoration to return it to its former historic appearance. The building is not open to the public at this time.",
