    "body": "2007:  Photographers Deon and Trish Reynolds       Mr. Reynolds interest in photography began at a young age when his father introduced him to the art of photography and helped him to make his very own camera.  Educated in Portland at the Museum Art School, now the Pacific Northwest College of Art, Mr. Reynolds apprenticed wit several renowned artists and photographers.  He became a studio assistant and photographer, shooting catalogs and advertisements for prominent companies and by the time he married Trish, he has become well versed in the art of commercial photography.    Deon's background in commercial photography gave him the freedom to pursue the photography he yearned to do.  Death Valley was his first subject, and from there Deon and Trish began to explore all of Nevada.  Now they live in Eureka, Nevada, in an 1880 bank building, complete with a vault, where they operate the Eureka Gallery to sell their work and that of regional artists.  Deon and Trish's interest in photography has taken them all over the American West, capturing the wild and surreal nature of the Wild West.  Visit www.deonreynolds.com.
