Ticket purchasing and shuttle bus boarding occurs near the Mammoth Mountain Adventure Center which is located near Mammoth Mountain Main Lodge. The shuttle bus will take visitors to any of ten bus stops in the valley including the Devils Postpile and Rainbow Falls trailheads. For more detailed information on the shuttle bus and how to travel to the monument during the shuttle bus operating season, visit the shuttle bus page. For through-hikers, backpackers, or other visitors without vehicles needing to get to Mammoth Lakes: The Reds Meadow\/Devils Postpile Shuttle bus is free for visitors between Stop 10 (Reds Meadow Resort) and Stop 1 (Agnew Meadows). If you are planning to travel to the Mammoth Mountain Adventure Center then on to Mammoth Lakes, here is the process:  Board the Reds Meadow\/Devils Postpile Shuttle Bus at any stop in the Reds Meadow Valley. The fare of $7\/per adult or $4\/child under 12 (children 2 and under are free) can be paid directly to the bus driver. Exact change is preferred. Change can generally be obtained at the Devils Postpile Ranger Station (open 9-5 daily between mid-June and Labor Day) or Reds Meadow Store. If the Adventure Center\/Mammoth Mountain\/Mammoth Mountain Inn is your final destination, the bus will drop you off at that location. For those of you traveling on to Mammoth Lakes\/Yosemite\/other Eastern Sierra destinations, read on. At the Adventure Center, between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., board one of two buses (the both go to the Village at Mammoth, which is the transit hub for Mammoth Lakes.) Board either the Bike Park shuttle (free for backpackers\/hikers\/campers) or any Devils Postpile\/Reds Meadow Shuttle Bus going out of service for the day. Tell your driver your plan on the way out of the Reds Meadow Valley and they will be able to tell you which bus to board. Once at the Village at Mammoth, a variety of bus lines will take you to other destinations within the Town of Mammoth Lakes. All buses departing from the Village that stay within Mammoth Lakes are free. Any buses that utilize the Highway 395 corridor are pay services.  OUTSIDE OF THE SHUTTLE BUS OPERATING SEASON When the Devils Postpile\/Reds Meadow Shuttle Bus is not running, you may drive your vehicle into the valley. Keep in mind that the road is narrow, steep, and descends almost 1,500 vertical feet from the Minaret Vista Station, where visitors pay a standard amenity fee of $10. Parking lots usually fill up by 11:00 a.m. during nice weather or on busy weekends. Planning your trips to arrive before 10:30 a.m. or after 2:00 p.m. will make it easier to find parking. The Devils Postpile Road currently has a vehicle length limit of 37 feet, for the short stretch of road going to the ranger station and campground.  FOR VEHICLES LONGER THAN 37 FEET VISITING DEVILS POSTPILE There is currently a vehicle length restriction of 37 feet on the Devils Postpile spur road. This does not apply to the entirety of the Reds Meadow Road and larger vehicles may still access USFS campgrounds and facilities. There are a few options for visitors with long vehicles wishing to visit Devils Postpile. Recreational Vehicles: For visitors with recreational vehicles or vehicle\/trailer combinations longer than 37 feet that wish to camp in the Reds Meadow Valley, there are several U.S. Forest Service campgrounds all within 5-6 miles of Devils Postpile that can accommodate larger RVs. Visit www.fs.usda.gov\/inyo for more information. Once you find a camping spot, the shuttle bus is free for in-valley transit. You can take the shuttle from your campground to Devils Postpile or the Rainbow Falls Trailhead for free. There is not adequate parking for large RVs at the monument after the shuttle bus season. Commercial Tours: All commercial tours must apply for a commercial use authorization. If the commercial tour will be traveling in a vehicle longer than 37 feet, you must contact Eastern Sierra Transit Authority to arrange transportation into the monument for the tour. If the tour is arriving in a vehicle less than 37 feet, you still must apply for a commercial use authorization. Educational Tours and Non-Profit Groups: If you're visiting Devils Postpile as part of a non-profit or educational tour, please visit the special use permit page to apply for a special use permit.  AREA AND REGIONAL TRANSIT OPTIONS The area surrounding Devils Postpile is relatively easy to navigate using public transit. There are two primary transit providers. Eastern Sierra Transit provides bus service to the monument (fee service), within the Town of Mammoth Lakes (free), and along the Sierra Crest from Ridgecrest to Reno (fee service). Visit Eastern Sierra Transit for more information. Yosemite Area Regional Transportation Service (YARTS) provides transit from the Mammoth Area into Yosemite and to the West side of the Sierra (Mariposa area) for a fee. Contact YARTS for more information.  Backpackers: Combining the Reds Meadow\/Devils Postpile shuttle with the free routes in Mammoth Lakes and\/or the YARTS buses is the easiest way to get from the monument\/Reds Meadow Valley to town or to Yosemite.",
