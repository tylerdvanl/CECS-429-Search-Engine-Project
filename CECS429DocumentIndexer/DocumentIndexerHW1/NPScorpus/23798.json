This isn't true in the late fall, winter, and spring. From now until May 14, 2016 visitors can once again access Frijoles Canyon, the park visitor center, and the main archeological sites using their personal vehicle. Visitors can visit Frijoles Canyon from sunrise to sunset. Just be sure to leave before it's dark.        Snow is important to keeping Bandelier beautiful. photo by sally king  SNOW DAYS Frijoles Canyon gets an average of 25\" of snow per season. The mesas get twice that and the highest elevations in the park can get even more snow. If you arrive in Bandelier just after a snow event the Main Loop Trail will be closed to visitors until staff can clear it of snow. Walking on the snow creates ice that continues to be a safety hazard for months. If it has just snowed you may want to sleep in and arrive a bit later to Bandelier. If you come early (after 9 AM but before the snow is cleared) we will let you wait near the fireplace in the visitor center. If it snows enough, the park may even be closed. Call (505)672-3861 X 517 before you leave home to make sure the park is open. Hurray for snowy days. They provide more than half the annual precipitation for most areas of the park. This moisutre is neccessary for Bandelier to stay the beautiful and unique place that it is.        Snow can actually accentuate the forms of the archeological sites. photo by sally king  A SPECIAL BEAUTY Snow can make Bandelier even more special. A dusting, or even a dump, of snow acts to highlight the dwellings. The sun can sparkle like minature diamonds off the ice crystals in the trees. Hairy-earred Abert's squirrels are more active and far more likely to be seen. Be careful walking under trees soon after a snowfall. Snow may dump on you. If you come dressed for the weather conditions you can have an amazing visit to Bandelier in the winter.
