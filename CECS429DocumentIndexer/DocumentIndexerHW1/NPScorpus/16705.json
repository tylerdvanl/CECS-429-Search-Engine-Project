Although this will change business for many state and local parks and museums, Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site is a federal site. So as a reminder – firearms are still prohibited – both concealed and open carry – inside of all federal facilities in the state, including National Park Service sites.  The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (see below) altered park policy and allows for the possession of hand guns while visitors are on park grounds, but not inside of federal buildings. Please contact us at 785-354-4273 or email us by clicking here if you have any questions.   As of February 22, 2010, a new federal law (the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Discolsure Act) allows people who can legally possess firearms under applicable federal, state, and local laws, to legally possess firearms in this park. It is the responsibility of visitors to understand and comply with all applicable state, local, and federal firearms laws before entering this park. As a starting point, please visit the Kansas Attorney General's website at http:\/\/ag.ks.gov. Federal law also prohibits firearms in certain facilities in this park; those places are marked with signs at all public entrances. The Visitor Center meets the criteria of a federal facility. Firearms are not permitted inside the building.
