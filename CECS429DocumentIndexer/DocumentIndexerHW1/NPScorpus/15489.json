    "body": "Winter Activities          Hiking, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing are popular in the wintertime. Visitors must bring their own snowshoes and cross-country skis, as there are no rentals available. A 4-6 inch snow base is recommended. Trails are not groomed. The best areas for cross-country skiing include:   Glenwood Dunes Trail System This extensive trail system features interconnected loops through gently rolling wooded dunes ranging from less than a mile to nearly 15 miles. The trail system can be accessed from either the Glenwood Dunes parking lot or the Calumet Dunes parking lot.    Tolleston Dunes Trail System This 2.9 mile trail winds amid varied habitats ranging from oak savanna to wetlands and is a good choice for advanced skiers. There are some difficult hills that can be tricky to navigate.   Hikers and visitors using snowshoes are asked to walk to the right of the cross-country ski tracks whenever possible. Sledding and snowmobiling are not permitted.    Â    Shelf Ice Shelf ice often forms along the edge of Lake Michigan during periods of cold weather. Don't be fooled. Despite its appearance, the shelf ice is not solid. In fact, due to the way it is formed, the shelf ice has numerous air pockets. It can be difficult to tell where the ice ends and the beach begins.  Do NOT walk on the shelf ice. A person applying even a small amount of weight on the ice can easily fall through and into frigid water that can quickly kill. Enjoy the beautiful and unique ice formations from the safety of solid ground.",
