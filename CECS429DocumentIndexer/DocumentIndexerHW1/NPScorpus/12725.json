This important work is accomplished by restoring fire's natural role in the environment and by reducing hazardous fuels.  Each year, managers prepare an Annual Fuels Treatment Plan that lists all the approved prescribed burns and mechanical fuel reduction projects that will help the parks accomplish goals.  If you are visiting the parks, be aware that fire and smoke can be present at any time. Since the execution of burns depends on air quality, local fire activity, fuel moistures, and weather, the times listed here are estimates only. Fuels Projects Tables   The table below identifies the planned projects for Calendar Year 2016 and their status. There are 11 projects totaling over 2,661 acres. This list is only a guide.
