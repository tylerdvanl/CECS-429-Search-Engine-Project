Joseph Pulitzer, publisher of the newspaper The World, spearheaded the sale of models of the Statue of Liberty to the public through his newspaper. Beginning in 1885, Pulitzer began advertising the sale of these models to be sold to the public in two sizes; a 12-inch model for five dollars and a 6-inch model for one dollar. The museum collection includes several of these original American Committee models. Original letters addressed to Joseph Pulitzer are included in the museum collection and indicate that raising of funds for the construction of the pedestal was not a simple task, as illustrated in the 23 March 1886 letter written by American Committee treasurer Henry Foster Spaulding concerning the dire need for funds to continue the work of constructing the Pedestal.       A letter addressed to Joseph Pulitzer from Henry Foster Spaulding regarding funding for the pedestal and a request for $11,000, March 23, 1886 National Park Service, Statue of Liberty NM         A mallet used in the process of hammering in rivets National Park Service, Statue of Liberty NM  While under the control of the United States Army in the 1920s, the Statue of Liberty was in need of repair.

The restoration involved approximately 1,000 workers from many different trades who proudly displayed their union affiliation and contribution on their clothing and equipment.

The engineering and architectural work on the 1980s restoration of the Statue is extensively documented and all reports are available for research in the museum archives and library.       Reflected lenses used in the Statue of Liberty's original torch c. 1934 National Park Service, Statue of Liberty NM        The 1980s restoration replaced the original cast iron armatures with stainless steel bars and a decision was made to replace the original torch.

The original torch, with its 250 colored glass plates designed by Gutzon Borglum in 1916 is now on exhibit in the lobby of the pedestal. The lighthouse fresnel lens once used in the torch was removed and is now in museum storage.         A brass pin with the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation logo commemorating the centennial of the Statue of Liberty, 1986 National Park Service, Statue of Liberty NM  The task of raising funds for the Statue of Liberty's 1980s restoration was undertaken by the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, a not-for-profit corporation headed by former Chrysler Corporation President Lee Iacocca.

A museum dedicated to the history of immigration to the United States was proposed and built inside the pedestal of the Statue in the 1960s. The completed museum, called the American Museum of Immigration (AMI) opened to the public in 1972 and was administered by NPS curators until 1991 when it closed after the opening of the Ellis Island Immigration Museum. The administrative and business files of AMI and items associated with its development and operation are in the museum archives and collection.       The museum objects once exhibited in the AMI are now part of the museum collection and some of these items, such as a wood plate brought by an immigrant from Czechoslovakia, are currently on display in the Ellis Island Immigration Museum.        Hand-painted wooden plate from Czechoslovakia c. 1923 National Park Service, Statue of Liberty NM       < Early European Use of Liberty and Ellis Islands | Back to Museum Collection | The Statue of Liberty in Popular Culture >",
