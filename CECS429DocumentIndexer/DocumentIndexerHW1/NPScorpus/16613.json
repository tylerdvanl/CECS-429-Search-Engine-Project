NPS\/Diane Renkin       Fishing Bridge RV Park, elevation 7,800 feet (2,377 m), is located near the Yellowstone River where it exits Yellowstone Lake on its way north toward the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. Directly off the east entrance road, close to Lake Village and Bridge Bay, it is in a busy and popular section of the park. Mud Volcano area and Hayden Valley (a great place to look for wildlife) are within close driving distance. The nearby historic footbridge spans the Yellowstone River adjacent to the road, where you may view spawning cutthroat trout during late spring. This is the only campground in Yellowstone to offer water, sewer, and electrical hookups for RVs. It is a large campground with more than 325 sites and because grizzly bears frequent the area, it is for completely hard-sided units only—no tents or tent campers are allowed. Campfires are prohibited in the Fishing Bridge RV Park, including the use of portable fire pits. Pay showers and laundry are available in Camper Services located near the campground entrance. Fishing Bridge also offers an RV dump station, a nearby store, and the historic Fishing Bridge Museum and Visitor Center. A park ranger hosts nightly evening programs from June to early September at the Fishing Bridge Visitor Center amphitheater. Please see the ranger program schedule in the park newspaper for more information. This campground is managed by park concessionaire Xanterra Parks and Resorts and takes reservations at 1-866-Geyserland (within the U.S.), (307) 344-7311 or online at YellowstoneNationalParkLodges.         Sites: >325   Elevation: 7,800 ft (2,377m)   Accessible Sites: Yes   Flush Toilets: Yes   Pay showers\/laundry onsite: Yes (Two showers included each night)   Dump station: Yes (Dump stations may close if temperatures are below freezing.)
