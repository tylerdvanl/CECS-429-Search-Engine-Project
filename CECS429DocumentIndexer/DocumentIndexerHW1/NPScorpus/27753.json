Because of shoals at the harbor entrance, ships were forced to enter the harbor from the south and sail toward the fort on Sullivan's Island. In this position, they could not fire on the fort until they turned into the harbor. By the mid-19th century, Fort Sumter added its firepower to keep ships out of the harbor. Since Moultrie was in continuous use by the Army for coastal defense for 171 years, it has played an important role in the nationâ€™s history. Please use the links to the museum exhibits to learn more about Fort Moultrie during these important events.
