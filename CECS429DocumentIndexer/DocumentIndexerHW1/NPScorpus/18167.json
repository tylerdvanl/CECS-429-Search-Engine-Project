    "body": "Kids & Youth       Â    The President William Jefferson Clinton Birthplace Home National Historic Site represents the early years in the life of President Bill Clinton. This is the home where his education began. It only makes sense that we would like to help the youth of today advance their education as well.  We have many activities throughout the year to give kids a rewarding experience and develop their minds. From the Junior Ranger activity books, to our Junior Ranger Camp, we help children along their own path of growth.",
