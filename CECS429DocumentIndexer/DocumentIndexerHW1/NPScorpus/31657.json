From Main Overlook to Turkey Spur is a moderate 1.6 mile hike (3.2 miles round trip). Along the way hikers will enjoy many breathtaking views of the gorge and river far below. The trail is rated moderate because of several small steep hills near Turkey Spur. A self-guided trail brochure interprets the first half mile of this trail. The trail begins at Main Overlook and ends at the Turkey Spur Overlook. The road to Turkey Spur allows for an easy return or for a vehicle shuttle for those not wishing to hike back.            Little Laurel Trail This strenuous trail connects Grandview with the New River 1,400 feet below. The trail follows an old road for two miles as it descends to the river, passing by the site of an old coal mine at Royal. The road descends steeply in some places with a total elevation change of around 1400 feet. This change in elevation provides an opportunity to view a great diversity of spring wildflowers.    The Little Laurel Trail begins at the parking area for shelter #3 and #4. The lower trailhead is on the Glade Creek Road. From Beckley follow Route 41 towards Prince. Just before the bridge that crosses the New River is a gravel road on the right that leads past the trailhead. Follow the signs toward Glade Creek (Royal Road). The trailhead (an unmarked gated, gravel road) is just ¼ mile down this road on the right near the scattered foundations of the coal town of Royal. Please do not block the gate; the road is still used by park staff as an administrative road.         A hiker on the Castle Rock Trail stands beneath a large cliff face.

This loop will take hikers below the overhanging cliffs on the Castle Rock Trail and then alongside the outstanding viewpoints on the Grandview Rim Trail.
