In addition to the Junior Ranger Booklet program and summer camps, here are some of the special activities designed specifically for children aged 6 to 12: Discovery Hunt First grade students from Mundo Verde Public Charter School have created a self-guiding discovery hunt for children ages 5 and older. The discovery hunt is designed for the 1\/2 mile Woodland Trail, located just behind the Nature Center. Pick up the treasure hunt kit for free at the Nature Center front desk and then set off on a discovery hunt with the family. TRACK Trail Designed to introduce children to the wonders of nature as well as the benefits of outdoor exercise, the Rock Creek Park TRACK Trail runs for one mile (two miles, out and back) on the paved, multi-use trail paralleling Rock Creek between Broad Branch Road and Porter Street. Four different TRACK Trail brochures may be picked up at the trailhead. For more information, click here.",
