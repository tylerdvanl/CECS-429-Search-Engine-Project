Are NOT allowed at Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield.  Our National Parks are special places for special people. They’ve been created for everyone as a whole, not just for one particular individual. In order to ensure that visitors have a meaningful and educational visit, the Organic Act of 1916 was established. The National Park Service preserves unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the national park system for the enjoyment, education and inspiration of this and future generations. The more we learn, the more we understand the past and what we are to become in the future. When an artifact is removed, it is a piece of history that cannot be replaced. That one item could tell a story or be the missing piece to a puzzle that will remain a mystery forever. Stolen items are not just a loss for the Battlefield but for everyone who hopes to learn more about American history.  The Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield museum has encased many artifacts that were discovered by our Regional Archaeological Team. Some items have been found by visitors years ago who did the right thing and turned them in to the staff so they could be displayed and we could all learn a little more . These items have been inventoried, researched and preserved so that we may educate visitors on who participated in the Battle of Kennesaw. They tell the story of what happened here at the mountain and how this battle was a turning point in the Atlanta Campaign. Helping us preserve history helps preserve history for everyone. If you see someone relic hunting, metal detecting or finding and removing artifacts, please do not approach them. Notify the visitor center immediately at 770-427-4686 ext. 0. A federal law enforcement officer will investigate further. Please keep in mind that acts against the Battlefield are felony crimes. Per 18 United States Code 1361: Destruction of Government Property; 18 United States Code 641: Theft of Government Property\/degradation; 18 United States Code 2: Aiding and abetting; 18 United States Code 371: Conspiracy to defraud the United States.  If you have any questions or are unsure of the boundaries, please do not hesitate to call the visitor center during normal business hours or you may email the Superintendent directly.  Enjoy your visit and help us to help future visitors by taking ONLY pictures and leaving only footprints.       Items confiscated from relic hunters. NPS",
