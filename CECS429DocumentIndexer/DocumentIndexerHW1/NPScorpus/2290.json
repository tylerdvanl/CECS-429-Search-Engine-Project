    "body": "Where the highway ends, the Ancestral Puebloan Wild West Prehistory Begins...  The prehistoric Puebloan Ancestors built Tsegi Phase villages within the natural sandstone alcoves of our canyons. The resilient Ancestral Puebloans paved the way for current Native American groups in the Southwest region. These villages, which date from AD 1250 to 1300, thrill all who visit with original architectural elements such as roof beams, masonary walls, rock art, and hand and foot holds.              Homes of the Ancestral Puebloans   Learn about the people who built and lived in Keet Seel and Betatakin and the history of these ancient homes.",
