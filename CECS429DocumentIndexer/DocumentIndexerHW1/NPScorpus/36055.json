Many of our native plants, as well as our landscaped Spanish Garden, attract hummingbirds year-round. Migratory and local hummingbirds sip sugar-filled nectar from flowers to fuel their cross-continental flights throughout the year. These plants also provide food and shelter for other animals. Spotted ground squirrels eat seeds and live in the root systems of bushes. Birds rest in our trees by day while owls perch at night, searching for prey. Our trail-system offers visitors and local residents a place to stroll, jog, or relax through grassy hills and shaded walkways. From the trails, visitors can take in the view of the Franklin Mountains to the north, and the Bridge of the Americas and Mexico to the south.",
