A segment of the Falls Trail collapsed in this area of geologic hazard, and cannot be repaired. Boaters will no longer be able to hike out of the Rio Grande via Frijoles Canyon. The nearest alternative that we can offer is to hike out on the Burro Trail, accessed at the mouth of Alamo Canyon. The map below describes this alternate route.",
