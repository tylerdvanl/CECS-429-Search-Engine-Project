    "body": "Superintendent's Welcome         Superintendent Don Striker NPS Photo \/ Jay Elhard  Welcome to YOUR park.   You are just in time to join us in celebrating a very special occasion, the centennial of the National Park Service. One hundred years ago the National Park Service was created to care for and protect the nation’s natural and cultural treasures, to preserve its stories, and to create a common ground for all its citizenry to enjoy now and far into the future.   In Denali, we are privileged to share the stories of the human connection to a vast and wild landscape. Subsistence hunting, trapping and gathering occur today just as they did hundreds of years ago. Denali also serves as a barometer for change.   As permafrost thaws, glaciers shrink, and tree lines rise, we feel humbled to care for this living laboratory that is so critical to understanding the effects of climate change on our global community. More than anything else, we hope you celebrate the true ideal of national parks here in Denali, a place that has been set aside to connect people to America’s past, a place that protects present wildlife and amazing landscapes for your enjoyment and that of future generations, and a place that celebrates the individual’s opportunity to experience inspiration, reflection, awe, and wonder.   It's a big idea, but we believe Denali is big enough for every visitor to find something special in their park. Enjoy your visit.   -- Don Striker, Superintendent",
