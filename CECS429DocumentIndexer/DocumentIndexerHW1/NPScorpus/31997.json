Founded in 1856, Wilberforce University (WU) was founded to provide an intellectual Mecca and refuge from slavery's first rule: ignorance.  (WU history).  The university was named in honor of one of the most well-known abolitionists in history, William Wilberforce of England.  While the Civil War raged in the 1860's, Wilberforce University suffered and would close its doors in 1862 due to falling enrollment.  In March of 1863 though, it re-opened when the African Methodist Episcopal Church purchased the property and then newly incorporated in 1863.  Since then, Wilberforce University has operated as the nation's oldest, private Historically Black University.  In 1887, the state of Ohio began providing funds to the university for a combined Normal and Industrial department.  This branch of Wilberforce would eventually split from WU and become Central State University, the sister university to Wilberforce University. In 1894, Charles Young reported to the university as the instructor for Military Sciences courses.  While at Wilberforce University, Young would forge lifelong friendships with those in the community and with those he worked with, namely W.E.B. DuBois.  Because of his fondness for the area and the university, Young would make Wilberforce, Ohio his permanent residence and to raise a family despite constantly traveling the globe for his military duties.
