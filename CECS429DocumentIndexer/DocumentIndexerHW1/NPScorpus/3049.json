Laborers were needed to manage the cattle. It is not known exactly how many cowboys worked for the various companies. Some worked year-round while others were hired seasonally for roundups and branding. Some cowboys at Pipe Spring worked to pay their annual tithe to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Cowboys remained an important part of Pipe Spring and Arizona Strip life through the early decades of the 20th century.
