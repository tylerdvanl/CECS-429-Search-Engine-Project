Herbert Hoover       Herbert Hoover's journey began in 1874 in a two-room cottage in the center of West Branch, Iowa. His ancestors arrived in horse-drawn wagons hoping to find a new life for their families as they settled in this developing, primarily Quaker, midwestern rural community.       Hoover family reunion, 1878 NPS Photo       Family & Fellowship Herbert Hoover's parents and their fellow Quakers played a large role forming his values. During these early childhood years, Herbert saw how the Quaker faith promoted simplicity, integrity, equality, peace, and service to others. The hard work and conscientious deeds of his parents and their neighbors helped build a community (of Quakers and others) that also supported the Hoover family.       Second Street Friends Meetinghouse in West Branch, 1885 Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum       The Religious Society of Friends The Friends, or Quakers, built a meetinghouse in 1857. The Quakers worshipped in silence until a member felt compelled to express his or her spiritual thoughts. Hulda Hoover often shared inspired messages and eventually became a traveling minister. Quakers expected children to sit quietly during hours-long services. Herbert Hoover later remarked: “Those who are acquainted with Quaker faith … will know the intense repression upon a ten-year old boy who might not even count his toes. [I]t was a strong training in patience.”       Jesse and Hulda Hoover in 1879 Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum       Jesse & Hulda Hoover Young \"Bertie's\" parents were pillars in this community. Hoover's father, Jesse, was a devoted family man and owner of a successful local business. His mother, Hulda, was a Quaker minister. Alongside like-minded family and neighbors, they demonstrated leadership, devotion, industriousness, and fellowship.       A West Branch blacksmith shop, circa 1900 NPS Photo       Blacksmith & Businessman In 1871 Jesse established his own blacksmith and wagon shop. One of three \"smithies\" in the 500-person town, he was skilled, well-liked, and fair. He forged necessary tools and strong business relationships that served the thriving community. Blacksmiths were critical to growing farm communities like West Branch. They shaped glowing hot metal with hand tools in the blacksmith shop over a coal fire. Their services helped keep farms running by shoeing horses and repairing essential equipment like wagons, plows, and pumps. Loud, dirty, and bustling, the shop likely fascinated the young Hoover boys. Spending hours watching and helping their father, they learned firsthand a strong work ethic.",
