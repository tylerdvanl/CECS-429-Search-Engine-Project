Keywords: invasives, insects, pests, non-native plants, non-native animals, exotic plants, exotic animals, forest management, resource protection, resource management, natural resources, service learning    Overview By being directly involved with real issues and problems, students learn the skills and create a desire to be proactive with non-native invasive species. Objective(s) Explain\/define invasive species and their effect on natural communities.  Identify five local invasive plants and two invasive pests by sight, plant keys or fact sheets.  Recognize Asian Longhorned Beetle and Emerald Ash Borer, their damage or evidence of activity.  Articulate possible problems, issues and effects of invasive species.  Gain an understanding of the scope of the invasive issues.  Understand the importance of current actions to eradicate and control invasive species.      Background The invasion of exotic plants and pests into our natural forest and woodland community is an ever growing real issue that all humans will deal with in some way soon. This study is not currently part of my forestry curriculum but I believe it should be and will soon be required. This unit is an attempt to arm my students with the information, knowledge and skills to educate others and manage exotic invasive species.  Procedure    Step 1   Lesson One: Students will become aware of the issues around invasive species including plants, animals, fungi, bacterial, and viruses. 45-60 minutes  Lesson Two: Students will understand the difference between native plants, exotic plants, exotic invasive plants and how they fit in natural communities. 45-60 minutes  Lesson Three: Students will be able to identify and explain the difference between exotic species and invasive exotic species.  Lesson Four: Students will collect exotic invasive plants and identify by sight or identification guides and other resources. 1.5-2 hours  Lesson Five: Students will become familiar with five local invasive plants including: Japanese Knotweed, Japanese Barberry, Multiflora Rose, Common Buckthorn, Amur Honeysuckle and exotic pests such as Asian Longhorned Beetle, Emerald Ash Borer, and Hemlock Woolly Adelgid. They will gather information and construct fact sheets for each species. (5 sheets) 1-1.5 hours for each sheet  Lesson Six: Student will demonstrate the ability to analyze data and formulate a logical response to control\/eradicate on exotic plant found at the Mallory lot. 90 minutes  Lesson Seven: To remove the Japanese Knotweed in a manner that will kill the plants currently growing and not cause another infestation on site, down stream or any other locations. 5 hours  Lesson Eight: Students will think about the long term effects of invasive species and how our lives may change as a result.                Step 1     Lesson One: Students will become aware of the issues around invasive species including plants, animals, fungi, bacterial, and viruses. 45-60 minutes Lesson Two: Students will understand the difference between native plants, exotic plants, exotic invasive plants and how they fit in natural communities. 45-60 minutes Lesson Three: Students will be able to identify and explain the difference between exotic species and invasive exotic species.

Assessment Accurate completion of the worksheet for the article At War with Invasive Species.  Completed written invasive species definition.  A collection of five invasive plant leaves, stems, and or flower samples with site map and location found noted.  Accurate completion of five invasive plant and two invasive pest fact sheets.  Completed eradication plan.  Written summary of how invasive species may impact your life.     Park Connections Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller actively manages invasive species within the park boundaries.  Extensions The methods which seem to work best for my students are hands on activities in real life issues and problems. With this in mind, I was looking for class activities to generate interest and concern on a personal level, offer opportunities to learn skills and create a desire to be proactive with exotic invasive issues.
