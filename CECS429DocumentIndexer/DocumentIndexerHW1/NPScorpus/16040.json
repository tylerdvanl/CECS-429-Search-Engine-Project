For more details, call 620-223-0310, or send an email message to the historic site's education coordinator. 4th grade students can also go towww.everykidinapark.govto complete an activity and obtain a free annual entry pass to more than 2,000 federal recreation areas, including national parks. \"During the National Park Service's centennial celebration, we want everyone to get to know their national parks, and we're offering a special invitation to fourth graders and their families to discover everything that national parks offer,\" said National Park Service Director Jonathan B. Jarvis. \"We hope these free passes for fourth graders will introduce 4th graders, their classes, and families to our national treasures, places where they can run and play, explore and learn.\" Fort Scott National Historic Site offers a variety of activities that fourth graders and their family can enjoy, including guided tours, a junior ranger program, special events such as artillery demonstrations offered on summer holiday weekends and during the Civil War Encampment in April, and other activities throughout the year. Each year in April and May, 4th grade school groups are invited to attend one of the site's education programs-Life on the Frontier or Sweep Through History.  To receive their free pass for national parks, each fourth grader can visit the Every Kid in a Park website and play the online game to access their special Every Kid in a Park pass. Fourth graders and their families can then use this pass for free entry to national parks and other federal public lands and waters all across the country from September 1, 2015, through August 31, 2016.The website also includes fun and engaging learning activities aligned to educational standards, trip planning tools, safety and packing tips and other important and helpful information for educators and parents. In addition to providing every fourth grader in America a free entry pass for national parks and federal public lands and waters, fourth grade educators, youth group leaders and their students across the country can also participate in the program through field trips and other learning experiences. In April 2016, fourth grade students from Fort Scott will be invited to attend a program featuring a Theodore Roosevelt impressionist. President Roosevelt was an ardent conservationist and established many national monuments during his presidency.   The goal of Every Kid in a Park is to connect 4th graders with the great outdoors and inspire them to become environmental stewards, ready to preserve and protect national parks and other public lands for years to come.The program is an important part of the National Park Service's 2016 centennial celebration, which encourages everyone to Find Your Park. Every Kid in a Park is an administrative-wide effort, launched by President Obama, and supported by eight federal agencies, including the National Park Service, the Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, Department of Education, Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Fort Scott National Historic Site is a unit of the National Park Service. The park buildings are open from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., while the grounds are open from dawn to dusk.",
