It was here, in the first home shared by the future president's parents, that Joseph and Rose Kennedy cultivated and instilled in their son the family's principles, skills, aspirations, and ambitions.          Park Planning Documents As part of our planning process, the National Park Service has done several studies and Kennedy family and the landscape of Beals Street. These studies are available for download below.         NPS  Cultural Landscape Report In 2013, the park completed a Cultural Landscape Report. This new report details the history of the greater Brookline area landscapes with a special focus on 83 Beal Street, the president's birthplace. Brookline's function as a streetcar suburb is described in detail, as well as new research on the home's transition from private residence to National Historic Site. Highlights of the report include detailed neighborhood maps showing changes in street design and structures over time as well many never before seen photographs of 83 Beals Street from 1914 to the present day.

The study places the Kennedy family's experiences and attitudes while living in Brookline in the historical context of the 1900s. This context offers insight into the social identities of the Kennedy family, life at home and the character of Brookline. The study concludes with an overview of how the home at 83 Beals Street transformed from a private residence to a National Historic Site and thoughtfully considers the process of memorialization.
