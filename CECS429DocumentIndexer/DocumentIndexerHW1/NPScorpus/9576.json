    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility             Accessibility       Clara Barton National Historic Site is a historic house museum and accessibility is not always ideal. However, we are always working to improve accessibility. Your comments on accessibility areas for improvement are always appreciated. Please feel free to contact us. The front porch and first floor of the structure are wheelchair accessible. We have a photo album with photographs for the second and third floors of the house. The site does not have public restrooms on-site.  The accessible restroom is located at adjacent Glen Echo Park. The path is paved, but does have some uphill grades and is about a seven minute distance from the house.",
