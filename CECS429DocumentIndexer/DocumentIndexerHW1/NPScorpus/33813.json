Both Confederate and Union troops constructed earthen dams to create standing water for both defensive and logistical purposes (water sources for troops and animals). However, today there are only a few small permanent ponds\/lakes left on the battlefield's property.Vernal (or temporary) ponds are more numerous, though. These ponds form in low points in especially wet seasons. These ponds play just as important of a role in the park's natural habitat as do the year-round ponds. They provide breeding ground and habitat for many types of amphibians and insects, and act as a source of food for other animals.The most notable year-round body of water is present in the Five Forks unit. The pond has been created by a beaver dam that blocks Hatcher's Run. It teems with life, as can be seen in the number of fish species that occupy its waters.",
