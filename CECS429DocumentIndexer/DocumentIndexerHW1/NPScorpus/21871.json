NPS Photo   The Doris Borhauer Basket Collection is comprised of 92 spruce root baskets created by Tlingit and Haida weavers from Southeast Alaska. The National Park Service purchased the collection from Doris Borhauer in 1970. Typically, only a portion of the collection is on display at any one time due to limited display space within the park.  You can view the entire collection in an on-line searchable database hosted by the Alaska Native Knowledge Network. The photographs and notes in the database were compiled by the Sitka Tribe of Alaska through a Historic Preservation Grant from the National Park Service.",
