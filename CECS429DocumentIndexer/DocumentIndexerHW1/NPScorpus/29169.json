Some common trees in this national park area include. Oak, Hickory,Eastern Red Cedar, Elm, and Sycamore. Open areas within the forest provide a place for the mixed grasses and wildflowers of the prairie to prosper. These prairie plants include Sideoats Grama, Little Bluestem, Indian Blanket,Yucca, and Coneflowers. A variety of animals utilize these forests and prairies. The Hermit Thrush and Flying Squirrel remain in the deep woods,while the White-tailed Deer will venture from the interior to the forest edge to increase foraging success. Some prairie spiecies such as the Eastern Meadowlark, Bull Snake, and the Nine-banded Armadillo will also be found near the edge. Here at Chickasaw National Recreation Area, in south central Oklahoma, these two ecosystems form a blend of forest and prairie known as an ecotone. This ecotone increases the diversity of animals that can be found here in Chickasaw National Recreation Area.",
