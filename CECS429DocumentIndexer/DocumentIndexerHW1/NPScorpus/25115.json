The McKinley Chalet Resort is located in the heart of the Nenana Canyon, less than two miles north of the entrance to Denali National Park.  To attend a program, you can take a shuttle, drive your personal vehicle, or walk to the McKinley Chalet Resort. Programs are offered at 10:00 am on Mondays and 3:30 pm Tuesday-Saturdays.   Topics vary from the very specific (e.g., bears or other wildlife) to the general (e.g., sustainable living), but all connect to the greater themes found in the story of Denali National Park and Preserve.",
