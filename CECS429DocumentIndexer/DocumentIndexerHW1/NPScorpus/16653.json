If you like to avoid crowds, check out spring (April\/May) and fall (September\/October). Be sure to read the current conditions before you head our way since some roads and facilities maybe be closed or affected by weather (which can look and feel like winter any month of the year).  A winter visit will fill your days with snowy landscapes, steaming geyser basins, and fewer crowds. However, access to the interior of the park (e.g. Old Faithful, Canyon) is restricted to oversnow travel and many facilities are closed, so it’s important to plan a winter trip well in advance.
