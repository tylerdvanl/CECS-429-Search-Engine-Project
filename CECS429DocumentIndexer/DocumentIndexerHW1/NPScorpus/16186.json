(See Federal Register Vol. 73, No. 123, Wednesday, June 25, 2008, page 35946) 2Hydrocarbons: certified by EPA to a Family Emissions Limit (FEL) of 15 g\/kW-hr or less. 3Carbon Monoxide: certified by EPA to a Family Emissions Limit (FEL) of 90 g\/kW-hr or less. Air emission figures for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons presented are either the Official Test Results (OTR) or the certified FEL. The Official Test Results are actual measured emissions. 4To operate in the park after March 15, 2015, a population of measurements for a snowmobile model may not exceed a mean output of 67 dB(A), and a single measurement may not exceed 69 dB(A), using the J1161 test procedures. The November 22, 2013 rule for winter use management in Yellowstone National Park allows a snowmobile meeting New BAT requirements for air and sound emissions may be operated in the park for a period not exceeding six years from the manufacturing date, or after the snowmobile has traveled 6,000 miles, whichever occurs later.",
