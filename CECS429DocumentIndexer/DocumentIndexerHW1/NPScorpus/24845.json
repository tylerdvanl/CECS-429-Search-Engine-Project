    "body": "Fishing       Sport Fishing The Alagnakâ€™s extraordinary rainbow trout, char, grayling, and abundant salmon are some of the most attractive sportfish in the world, and the river has become the most popular fly-in fishing location in all of southwest Alaska. Although the fishing is exceptional, these prized sportfish are still vulnerable to overfishing. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) carefully monitors the populations to ensure that the present regulations maintain the long-term stability of the Alagnak sport fishery. Visitors intending to fish should become familiar with these regulations specific to the Bristol Bay area. An Alaska sport fishing license is required of all nonresidents 16 and over, and most residents 16 to 59. You may also need a harvest record card and\/or king salmon stamp before you fish. For more information and to buy your licenses, stamps, and tags online, visit ADF&G's License and Permits web site. Sport fishing licenses and king salmon stamps may also be purchased from a license vendor (most AK sporting goods stores), by calling (907) 465-2376, or by mail at: ADF&G Licensing Section 1255 W. 8th Street P.O. Box 115525 Juneau, AK 99811-5525 Commercial Fishing The large salmon runs in Bristol Bay are subject to a carefully managed commercial harvest prior to their arrival in individual rivers including the Alagnak. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game allows commercial fishing only when there are enough fish to meet sufficient population numbers for spawning populations, subsistence, and sportfishing.",
