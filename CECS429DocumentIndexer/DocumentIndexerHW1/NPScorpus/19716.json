    "body": "Donate       Thank you for your interest in supporting the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area. Philanthropic contributions continue to make a significant difference and we welcome and are grateful for your support. There are several ways of supporting the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area. Your donation to the park may be made directly to the National Park Service or to our primary non profit, tax exempt support organization, the National Park Foundation. If you are interested in donating directly to the park you may contact the Superintendent by phone 678-538-1210 or e-mail. Donations may be mailed to: Superintendent, 1978 Island Ford Parkway, Sandy Springs, Georgia, 30350.  A monetary gift will be deposited in a separate donation account that will only be spent on the specific project or program for which you earmarked your gift. Donations made to the National Park Foundation, on behalf of the park, will be used by the park the same as described above. The advantage of making your contribution through the National Park Foundation is that the amount will be deposited in an interest bearing account. Visit the National Park Foundations website to learn more about making a donation on behalf of the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area.",
