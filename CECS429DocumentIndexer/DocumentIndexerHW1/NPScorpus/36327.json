SCA provides volunteers of all backgrounds and educational levels with meaningful conservation service internships and volunteer opportunities in our National Parks, National Forests, and other public lands. Each year over 3,000 volunteers perform 1.5 million hours of service in all 50 states to protect vital habitats, threatened wildlife, and other at-risk resources in our nation’s parks, forests and urban green spaces. This unique experience instills an ethic of conservation and inspires lifelong stewardship that benefits our members, our society, and our environment. Today, nearly 45,000 Alumni continue to practice the conservation ethic they first encountered through SCA as teachers, resource managers, park rangers, business people and in their personal lives. The Student Conservation Association offers positions in many park areas. While not a salaried position, you will receive compensation in the form of a stipend, moving expenses or mileage reimbursement and a monetary award which can be used for paying off old school loans or paying for additional classes. The SCAs at Big Bend are generally Conservation Internships. Typically, Big Bend employs 4–5 SCA students each fall and spring season.
