    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Permits & Reservations              Permits & Reservations       NOTE: Additional information on specific special events can be found on their permit applications. If you are unable to download an application, we are happy to send you one via fax, email, or hard copy.   Types of Permits GGNRA grants permits for special uses such as cultural programs, picnics, wedding ceremonies, festivals, athletic events, film and photography projects, etc. Click here for park maps. When your application is under review, the Office of Special Park Uses will look at multiple criteria, including whether or not there is a meaningful association between the park and the event, and how the event contributes to visitor understanding of the significance of the park. Information on this page is for the Golden Gate National Recreation Area (including Muir Woods, Alcatraz, Fort Point, Crissy Field and Baker Beach) and San Francisco Maritime National Historic Park. We do not issue permits for the Presidio Trust, state parks such as Mt. Tamalpias and Angel Island, San Francisco city parks such as Marina Green and Golden Gate Park, or the Fort Mason Center.    NOTE: Alcatraz Overnight Program for 2015 Suspended The Golden Gate National Recreation Area is suspending the Alcatraz Overnight program that is managed through a lottery system while it goes through an evaluation and possible reconfiguration. Alcatraz Island is a popular stop for most people visiting San Francisco. With more than 1.5 million visitors to the island each year and the high demand, the very limited overnight program reaches fewer than 600 people yet requires significant staff time to manage and implement. This year, the park will review the overnight program and evaluate how it can best meet the goals and mission of the National Park Service and the Interpretive and Education program on Alcatraz Alcatraz Event Application  No private events\/tours are allowed during daytime hours or during evenings with scheduled public tours. (Aim to schedule for Tuesday or Wednesday night) No weddings are permitted on Alcatraz. Private events on Alcatraz must be conducted in historically appropriate areas.

Project Review    If an event is unlike anything that has been held in the park before and\/or there are other aspects of the event the park needs to consider, your application will be taken through Project Review. This is the opportunity for all departments (and sometimes the public as well) to ask questions before approving your event.  If your application needs to go through Project Review, the application fee is usually $1000 and is always due before Project Review can begin. Project Review takes at least three weeks, and the process does not guarantee that your event will get approved. General Rules   All advertising, branding, and signs on site must be approved by NPS prior to your event. Signs cannot be more than 30% advertising. Large events require at least one Park Ranger present during the event as well as during loading. Events in sensitive areas require special approval. Staking or accessing a hydrant takes extra time and money. You may not enter most areas closed to the general public. Any event over 200 people will be required to submit a parking and transit plan, and in the case of a Crissy Field event, you must also obtain a permit from the Presidio Trust. If you want to have a large event (1000 or more people) at Crissy Field, it will need to go through Project Review. We only allow 3 large events at Fort Mason each year. A date and location can be held up to one year in advance with an application and application fee. Not all events will be granted exclusive use of an area. Your event and your advertising materials must provide Universal Access. We require composting and recycling at all events. Green Event Guidelines Sound cannot exceed 85db.
