NPS photo  Bobcat (Lynx rufus)                                Bobcats, also known as wildcats, are much smaller than mountain lions and have shorter tails.  These cats do well around park borders of urban Tucson where food like rabbits and quail are abundant.  Despite their relatively small size, reports have cited bobcats preying on animals as large as adult deer!  Their usual diet consists of small mammals, birds, and carrion. They are about 2 -4 feet long and weigh from 15 to 29 pounds.    Â      A mountain lion captured by an NPS wildlife camera. NPS photo  Mountain Lion (Puma concolor)                   The elusive mountain lion is the most powerful predator at Saguaro National Park. It is found in both districts.  They have the ability to kill prey larger than themselves and can leap 20 feet (6.1 m) or more!  Their jaws are so strong that they can bite through the shells of adult desert tortoises, something no other predator in the Sonoran Desert can do.  Total length: Up to 6 feet (1.5 m)  Weight: 75- 145 lbs (34 to 66 kg)  Diet: Deer, javelina, jack rabbits, squirrels",
