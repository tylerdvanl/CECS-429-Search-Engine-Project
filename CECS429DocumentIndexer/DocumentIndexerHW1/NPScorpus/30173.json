Thanks to the Dayton & Greene County Convention & Visitors Bureaus, there is now a list of Lodging and Restaurants around the park in Dayton to assist those in planning their visit to the area.  Many thanks to both bureaus for providing this information. Visitors to the park in the downtown Dayton area should view choices listed from the Dayton CVB.  Those visiting the park in the Wright-Patterson AFB area should view choices listed from the Greene County CVB.
