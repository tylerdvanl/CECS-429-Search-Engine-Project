Library of Congress  Theodore Roosevelt, as an adult, was never shy of crowds and basked in the attention of his supporters. Early on, he recognized the value of the 'photo op' to promote himself, and utilized photographs, as well as the news media, to their fullest extent. When 'motion pictures' were invented, thanks to the efforts of Thomas Alva Edison, Theodore seized upon this new form of 'social media'. His innately animated movements and abundant energy made him a natural for the motion picture lens. Many of these films have been archived by the Library of Congress.
