Many of these practices have simply been implemented by staff members adjusting operational procedures in day to day operations. Others have been developed through various initiatives and programs requiring outside funding sources. All rely on the commitment of park staff to look at what is done and try to make a difference.  Pictured Rocks views sustainability not only in how the park and its operations impact the environment, but also on how operations affect the health and safety of its employees and visitors. Almost universally, we have found that practices considered sustainable for the environment are equally beneficial for lakeshore employees. For instance, the production, use, and disposal of toxic and hazardous materials are of equal concern to both.  As the lakeshore's sustainability program evolves, we will continue to evaluate products, procedures, and operations to improve our sustainability scorecard.       Return to top of page",
