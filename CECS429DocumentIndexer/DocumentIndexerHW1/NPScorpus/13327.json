    "body": "Auto Touring       All of the roads in Yosemite National Park are scenic, but the most famous scenic drive is along the Tioga Road, a 39-mile (62 km) drive from Crane Flat to Tioga Pass. The road is typically open from late May or early June through sometime in November. (Check current road conditions.) The Yosemite Road Guide, available at visitor center bookstores, contains descriptions of each road inside the park and includes suggestions of where to stop along the way. Some typical driving times from Yosemite Valley:  Wawona\/Mariposa Grove: about an hour   Glacier Point: about an hour   Crane Flat: 30 minutes   Hodgdon Meadow\/Big Oak Flat Entrance: 45 minutes   Hetch Hetchy: 1.5 hours   Tuolumne Meadows: 1.5 hours   Tioga Pass: 1.75 hours",
