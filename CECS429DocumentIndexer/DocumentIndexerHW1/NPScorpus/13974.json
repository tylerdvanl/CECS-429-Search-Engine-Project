Primary interpretive themes are the key ideas through which the park’s nationally significant resource values are conveyed to the public. They connect park resources to the larger ideas, meaning, and values of which they are a part. They are the building blocks—the core content—on which the interpretive program is based. Each primary theme may connect to a number of specific stories or subthemes. These elements are helpful in designing individual services, ensuring that the main aspects of primary themes are addressed.      ROCKS & RIVER Powerful geologic forces of sedimentation, uplifting, and erosion created features in the gorge through which the river flows, influencing the plants and animals that live there.
