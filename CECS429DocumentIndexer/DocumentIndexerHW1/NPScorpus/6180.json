Saint-Gaudens NHS has several species of amphibians including five frogs, and several salamanders. Common amphibians include American Toads, Red Efts, Spring Peepers, Red-backed Salamanders, Bullfrogs, and Green Frogs. They can be found in garden pools, along seeps, springs, and streams, in the woods, or on the hiking trails.  Amphibians are known for their dual ability to live in water or on land. Red Efts are no different. Red Efts, also known as Eastern Newts or Red-spotted Newts, are a common site along the parkâ€™s hiking trails, particularly following a rain. They spend their youth in the water, then on land for two to seven years, before returning to the water to mature into aquatic adults. As aquatic adults they are water bound and no longer able to return to land. They can often be seen moving under the ice in the winter, as they stay active year round.",
