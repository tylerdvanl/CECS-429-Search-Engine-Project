It overlies the Cliff House Sandstone and is exposed only near the northern boundary of the park. This unit was deposited at water depths greater than the Cliff House Sandstone and represents the last significant transgression of the Western Interior Seaway into northwestern New Mexico. Few fossils have been found in the Lewis Shale unit within the park.",
