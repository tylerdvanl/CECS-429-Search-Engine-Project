Once visitors have scaled the rugged cliffs using the stairway from the landing cove, they will find a figure eight-shaped trail system that meanders over gentle slopes to dramatic overlooks, magnificent coastal views, and the last permanent lighthouse built on the west coast. An interpretive trail guide is available on the island to interpret these and other island resources.
