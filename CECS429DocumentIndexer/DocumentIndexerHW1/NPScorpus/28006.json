One of the best places to view the river up close is at Nemo, where restrooms, picnic tables and grills are available. The Rock Creek Campground, which is just a short distance from Nemo, offers overnight camping on a first-come\/first-served basis. The Lilly Bluff Overlook gives visitors an excellent 200-foot-high view of the river.  The Devils Breakfast Table rock formation is a unique horizontal rock perched and balanced upon a vertical rock spire.  Hikers can enjoy numerous trails:Point Trail (3.8 miles roundtrip)Lilly Bluff Overlook Trail (200 yards)Lilly Bridge Trail (0.8 miles roundtrip)Lilly Boulder Trail (1 mile roundtrip)Emory River Nature Trail (0.7 miles roundtrip)A portion of the Cumberland Trail (14 miles from the Devil's Breakfast Table to Nemo).

Obed also sports a variety of boulders for boulder climbers just a short distance from the Lilly Bluff Overlook parking area. Those who enjoy fishing can do so at many places along the Obed (an updated Tennessee fishing license is required). Another fun and educational place to visit is the Obed Visitor Center, located at 208 North Maiden Street in downtown Wartburg, Tennessee.
