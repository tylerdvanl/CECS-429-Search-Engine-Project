Wijiji differs from sites like Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl in that it appears to have been built at once rather than several building periods. Evidence can be seen in the exceptional symmetry of the building plan and the uniform masonry. Typical Chacoan features such as enclosed plazas and great kivas are absent at Wijiji.       Trail to Wijiji         Wijiji back wall NPS Photo, Russ Bodnar",
