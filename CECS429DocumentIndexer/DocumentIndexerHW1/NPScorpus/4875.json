    "body": "Pets Visiting the Monument       Please do NOT leave your pet inside your vehicle while you enjoy the park. Well behaved pets on a leash or under physical restraint are welcome in the park. You will need to clean up after your animal and have it under your direct control at all times. Keeping any living thing inside a parked car here in the Sonoran Desert is not recommended. Arizona revised statute 13-2910-A7 allows police and animal control officers to use reasonable means to remove the animal from the vehicle, including breaking out windows. Officers can take these steps and provide emergency medical care to the animal without the ownerâ€™s knowledge or consent. If the animal suffers any serious bodily damage or death, the owner could be arrested and charged with felony-level animal cruelty.",
