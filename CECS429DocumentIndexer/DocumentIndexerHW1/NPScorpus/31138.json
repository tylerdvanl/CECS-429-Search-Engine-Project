The home is furnished in the early to mid-1920s period and as such depicts a rural Texas lifestyle of 75 years ago.        President Johnson's photo hangs above a bed similar to one shared with his brother Sam   Guided Tours Park rangers give free guided tours of the home starting every half hour: 9:00 a.m. - 11:30 a.m. (closed for lunch) 1:00 p.m. -4:30 p.m.  To take the tour, meet the ranger on the front porch a few minutes before the next tour is scheduled to start.",
