It appears at the moment when you come over a rise and look down into the Potomac Valley and see the capital spread out with its great monuments... The years never diminished the feeling of pride and elation we felt in those beautiful buildings that belong to all of us. Lady Bird Johnson, dedication ceremony, April 6, 1976  Â    The Lyndon Baines Johnson Memorial Grove on the Potomac was designed by landscape architect Meade Palmer as a living memorial to the late president. Reached by a wooden footbridge, the memorial is composed of two very different areas: a meadow surrounded by lush deciduous trees and a grove of white pines. A spiral trail leads through the grove to a massive, roughly carved granite megalith by sculptor Harold Vogel. There are dramatic views of the National Mall from the lawn in front of the memorial.",
