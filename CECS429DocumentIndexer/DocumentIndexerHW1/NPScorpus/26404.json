More than 175 species of fruits and nuts preserved in the fossil record suggest a forest more diverse than any modern ecosystem in this part of the world.  It contained plants with modern relatives such as walnuts, chestnuts, oaks, bananas, magnolias, and palms. The forest was dense and moist, receiving an annual rainfall of three meters (almost 10 feet). But this semitropical environment was home to more than just trees and plants; the forest echoed with the buzzing of insects, the calls of birds, and the footfalls of mammals. Most of the mammalian beasts that thrived during this time period are only vaguely familiar to us now: creodonts – large meat-eaters similar to wolves or hyenas but related to neither; Hyrachyus – a distant relative of the tapir; and brontotheres – large rhino-like plant eaters. In addition to the mammals, reptiles such as crocodiles and tortoises lived alongside large catfish relatives.          Click on the image for a larger resolution Mural by Larry Felder        Key to mural       Dominant fossils found in this assemblage:1. Cercidiphyllum (tree)  2. Ensete (banana plant) 3. Sabalites (extinct fan palm)  4. Patriofelis (cat-like creodont, the size of a modern panther) 5. Macginicarpa (sycamore)  6. Orohippus (early horse) 7. Dioon (cycad) 8. Cornus (flowering dogwood)  9. Juglans (walnuts)  10. Pinus (pine tree)  12. Pristichampsus sp. (3m long crocodile)  13. cf. Ictalurus (freshwater catfishes) 14. Telmatherium (1.25m brontothere) 15. Castanea (chestnut) 16. Magnolia (magnolia tree)  17. Hyrachyus (‘running rhino’) 18. Lauraceae (laurel tree)  19. Cicadidae on Vitis (cicada on grape vine)  20. Meliosma (aguacatillo)  Filling the Role...  The Clarno Nut Beds flora is made up of predominantly angiosperms (flowing plants) like Magnolias, Meliosma, Macginicarpa, Ensete, Hydrangea knowltonni, and others. The beds also contain gymnosperms (seed bearing plants) like Juglans (walnuts) and more.The Nut Beds also preserve over 66 genera and 77 species of petrified woods, making it the most species rich fossil wood locality on Earth of any age.  Many of the petrified wood fossils include Saxifragispermum tetragonalis (willows and cottonwood), Juglans, Pinus, laurels, Sabalites, and Cercidphyllum.Patriofelis ferox was a creodont similar to the size of a modern panther.  Patriofelis translated from Latin means “father cat,” but this refers to superficially similar anatomy, rather than a relationship to the cat family (Felidae).  It first appeared in the middle Eocene some 45 million years ago.  It had short legs with broad flat feet, suggesting that it may have been a poor runner, but a quite good swimmer.  P. ferox was a reasonably good climber, as it was closely related to the extinct Oxyaenidae family.Orohippus major was a three toed horse, built for agility and maneuverability.  It is about the size of a large dog (2 feet tall at the shoulders) and diminutive by comparison with other modern horses.   What puts Orohippus into the Equidae family is its only equine trait, a slightly enlarged middle toe on its front and hind legs. But due to its small size and other traits, this browser would look more like a prehistoric deer.   Pristichampsus sp. was a 10 foot long (3m) crocodile that lived alongside many mammals 44 million years ago.  It had heavily armored skin and long legs, suggesting it was a cursorial (adapted to running) reptilian that spent most of its time hunting terrestrial mammals. Pristichampsus’s teeth were sharp and had serrated edges, characteristic of modern terrestrial crocodiles.   Hyrachyus eximius was a perissodactyl (odd-toed ungulate) mammal suspected to be the ancestor to modern tapirs and rhinoceroses.  It would have looked similar to a tapir, but probably lacked the tapir’s proboscis as there is no soft tissue or cartilage evidence preserved with the fossil to support this. The Hyrachyus’steeth resemble those of a rhino, portraying its ecological role as a ground dwelling browser.      Click here for a complete floral list.  Click here for a complete faunal list.
