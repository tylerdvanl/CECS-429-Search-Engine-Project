(September 1, 1863 through 1867) A native of Springfield, Illinois, he enlisted in the Army at the age of 51. During his posting at Fort Smith he served in a variety of roles within the military and the local community. He served not only as Post Chaplain but also as Provost Marshal and Commissary Officer.

He was the co-editor of a local newspaper, Fort Smith New Era. He often wrote editorials under the pen name of Thrifton.   Springer's real passion was to aid the widows, orphans and freed slaves displaced by the Civil War. He secured homes for over 200 Northwest Arkansas orphans to his home state of Illinois.   A portion of Springer's journal has been edited by William Furry in his book, The Preacher's Tale, University of Arkansas Press, 2001. Tom Iverson",
