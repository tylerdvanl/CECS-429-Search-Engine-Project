Approximately half of these species breed in the park including eighteen species of warblers. Roughly thirty of the species are year-round residents including tufted titmice, red-tailed hawks, Carolina chickadees, wild turkeys, and barred owls.

Certain areas, such as Big Meadows, support species that can be found nowhere else in the park.              Birds  Standard List  Customize Your List       Shenandoah National Park includes a wide variety of essential habitat for resident and migratory  birds.
