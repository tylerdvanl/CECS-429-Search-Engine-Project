October 04, 2006  Historic Beach Patrols  What was it like to work for the U.S. Life-Saving Service (LSS) during the fall, which was traditionally known as “shipwreck season” on the Great Lakes? One hundred years ago, LSS surfmen set out each night to hike the shoreline in search of ships in distress. This fall, the public is invited to relive history and join National Park Service (NPS) rangers and Volunteers-in-Park (VIPs) to recreate a traditional evening beach patrol. There will be only two chances to participate in this special event; meet at the Sleeping Bear Point Coast Guard Station\/Maritime Museum in Glen Haven at 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, October 14 or 21, 2006.   September 26, 2006  Take Pride in Sleeping Bear Dunes  Saturday, September 30, 2006 is National Public Lands Day across the country and volunteers are participating in Take Pride in America® special events which beckon “Lend a hand, it’s your land.”  At Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, it is a fee-free day for everyone to enjoy the park as well.  As a token of our appreciation, volunteers will receive a coupon to use for free entrance to any public lands at a later date.  Park rangers will host two activities:  a beach cleanup in the morning and an introduction to the Adopt-a-Beach program in the afternoon, where individuals or groups do more than just clean up a particular beach; they also record data, assess wildlife habitat and test the water.  Both activities meet first at the Lakeshore Visitor Center in Empire on Highway 72 and then proceed to a designated beach.   September 24, 2006  2006 Artist In Residence Award  Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore is pleased to introduce two Artists-in-Residence (AIR) this month.

They will also present a public program highlighting their crafts on Friday, September 29, 2006.   September 10, 2006  Ferry Concession Contract Solicitation  The National Park Service has issued a Concession Prospectus for the Tour Boat and Ferry Service at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore.

The Concessioner may provide motorized vehicle tours on South Manitou Island, sales of limited snacks and beverages, and transportation of kayaks and canoes.  The operating season is mid-May through mid-November.

August 24, 2006  Trumpeter Swans Released  In partnership with the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians, Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore has announced that eight young trumpeter swans were released in the park during the summer of 2006.  The eight were released together into one of the wetland areas within the Lakeshore and it is hoped that they will finish maturing and imprint on the area before migrating south for the winter.  If the release is successful, it is possible that in the near future the swans will return with mates to begin rearing families within the Lakeshore.   August 21, 2006  September Saturdays at the Lakeshore  Not only are there five Saturdays this September, but one of them is a fee-free day for all National Park sites! Five new programs will be featured this month on topics ranging from trees to grasses and coyotes to insects, walks through the dunes, and even a special guest lecturer. September 30, 2006 is National Public Lands Day (NPLD) when across the nation, thousands of volunteers “Take Pride in America”  and do their part to clean up parks, build trails, plant trees, etc. in national parks, forests and wildlife refuges. At Sleeping Bear Dunes that day, all are invited to participate in a beach cleanup in conjunction with the Alliance for the Great Lakes Adopt-a-Beach Program. That day, entrance to all public lands is free and anyone volunteering will receive a free pass to use on another day in the future.

The birds are courting and establishing territories in preparation for nesting. Piping Plovers continue to be listed as an endangered species under the Federal Government and Michigan Endangered Species Acts. Effective April 28, and until further notice later in the season, no pets will be permitted on those segments of beaches where Piping Plovers have established territories or nests. Dogs disturb birds while they are trying to establish nests, and threaten successful chick rearing.   February 10, 2006  No Evidence of Cougars 2006  The presence of cougars (Puma concolor) in Michigan has been debated for decades. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service currently lists the eastern cougar subspecies as endangered and presumed extinct in the wild. From November 2004 through April 2005, the National Park Service (NPS) conducted a study throughout the mainland portion of the Lakeshore, with a goal of collecting evidence of cougar presence. After six months of intensive study, staff at the Lakeshore did not find any physical evidence to support the reported presence of cougars in the park.
