The first step is learning how to visit safety. Being prepared and aware of safety concerns helps avoid damaging fragile natural and cultural resources. The National Parks Service protects all wildlife, plants, rocks, and artifacts. Please leave everything the way you find it at Tonto National Monument. Hiking is limited to designated trails. Watch your step and please do not lean on or sit on any cliff dwelling walls. Venomous Reptiles and InsectsScorpions, tarantulas, and centipedes cause an extremely painful sting. Rattlesnakes and Gila Monsters will deliver a life-threatening bite if they feel threatened. Please give them the right of way by staying back at least 10 feet (3 m). If they do not move out of the way or are very close to the trail, contact the Park Staff. CactusMany plants in the Sonoran Desert have spines and needles. It is best to avoid touching plants, even if it looks fuzzy. If you are stuck, wash the area thoroughly with soap and water. Use tweezers to remove spines if necessary. Seek professional medical advice about the possibility of infection. Africanized BeesThe bees at Tonto can be aggressive. If you see a solitary bee, do not swat at it. If there is a swarm nearby seek shelter immediately in the visitor center or your car. Bees will also 'pelt' as a warning sign. This is where the bees run into people without stinging. Consider seeking shelter soon. WaterWater is necessary when hiking to the Lower or Upper Cliff Dwelling. Please bring a bottle with you. Free spring water is available to refill bottles in the visitor center. Watch for signs of heat related emergencies. If you feel dizzy, nausea, very hot, or out of breath sit down in the shade, sip water. Call 911 or contact park staff if an emergency or you do not feel better after a short rest.",
