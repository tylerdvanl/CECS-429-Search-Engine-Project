The sun can be intense, so wear sunscreen and bring along a hat and a lightweight long-sleeve shirt. Winter Weather  During the winter months, prolonged exposure to cold weather can cause hypothermia. Be sure to dress in layers to avoid this. The cold can also cause snow and ice to build up on sidewalks and steps. Please be sure to use caution when traversing on paths, sidewalks and stairs within and around the park as they may be slippery  Bees Bees are frequently in the park's grassy areas throughout the spring and summer months. Closed toe shoes may help prevent stings and other insect bites. Poison Ivy Poison ivy is found in the woods of the park. Make sure to stay on designated paths to avoid exposure.
