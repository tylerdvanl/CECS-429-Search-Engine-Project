    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Pets              Pets      Prince William Forest Park is a popular dog walking spot for many of our visitors.  With its vast array of hiking trails and wide gravel fire roads, the park is a doggie favorite.  All pets entering the park must be on a leash of six feet or less at all times while in Prince William Forest Park.  Leashing your pet keeps people, wildlife and your pet safe. Pets are prohibited in the following areas (except for those aiding persons with disabilities):  Chopawamsic Backcountry Area Turkey Run Ridge Group Campground Any public building Cabin Camps    Pet owners shall be responsible for removing pet excrement from campsites, picnic areas, parking lots, trails and other public use areas. Do not leave your pet unattended in a vehicle or campsite. Interior temperatures of vehicles rise within minutes and pets can quickly overheat and die, even with the windows cracked. Owners are responsible for their pet's behavior and may receive fines if their animal creates problems with wildlife and\/or other visitors or is not on a leash. Please note: Violators of park rules and regulations will be issued a federal citation in accordance with Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations. For example: Failing to keep pets on a lead no longer than six feet in length is subject to a maximum fine not to exceed six months in jail or $5,000.
