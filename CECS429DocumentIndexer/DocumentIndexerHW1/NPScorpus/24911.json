The islands take the brunt of the ocean's erosional force, which can be tremendous. During one five year time period, a 30 ft (9 m) wide strip of barrier island beach eroded away! In addition to protecting the coast, the islands provide valuable breeding grounds for shorebirds and terns and habitat for predatory birds and foxes.  Â       Beach Ridges Thousands of years ago, an enormous amount of sand was created in the Brooks Range. When rivers flow over the ground, they pick up a large amount of this sand and carry it into the Chukchi Sea. When the waves of this sea crash on the shores of Bering Land Bridge National Preserve, the sand is redeposited on land. In places where this happens frequently, low sand dunes and sand ridges form. Most of the preserve's sand features are found in the Cape Espenberg area or on its barrier islands.",
