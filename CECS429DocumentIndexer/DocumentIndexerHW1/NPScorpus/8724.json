Over 20 miles of trails wind through a magical landscape of varied habitats and topography. Beech, maple, hemlock, and conifer forests and old fields grow on the sandy uplands and rugged hills of old glacial features. The trails receive about 140 inches of snow each winter.  Each trail offers a variety of loop lengths for a leisurely day ski or quick workout at the end of the day. All lakeshore trails are designed for diagonal stride only - skating is not permitted.  Trails are marked with blue diamonds and a map at each intersection.  Watch and listen for grooming equipment when you ski.   Trail maps are available at trailheads and at trail intersections. The Munising trails (C and D) feature several interpretive waysides on the natural and human history of the area. Be sure to stop at these for a brief overview of some interesting topics.  Skiing is free at the lakeshore; however, the park will be installing donation boxes for those who wish to assist us in the cost of maintaining these beautiful trails.  Whether you are a novice or an accomplished skier, we hope you find the trails challenging and fun.      For Your Safety  On the Grand Marais Trails, loops C and D cross a county road used by snowmobiles - listen and watch for approaching snowmobiles before crossing.   On the Munising Trails, loops A and B cross a snowmobile trail at four locations - listen and watch for approaching snowmobiles before crossing.  Watch for other skiers on downhill runs.   Ski trail conditions may vary. Heavy weekend use and alternating daytime thawing and nighttime freezing may turn snow packed slopes into fast, icy runs. Severe storms are common in the area and may rise quickly. Wind may obliterate the trail at times.   Darkness comes early in winter so allow plenty of time to return to your vehicle before dark. As always, be sure to let someone know you where are skiing and when you expect to return.  Wear adequate layers of clothing. Take food and water if you plan to be out for the day. Match your skill level to the trails you ski.   Pets, winter camping, snowshoeing, walking, and skating are not permitted on lakeshore ski trails.      For more information about skiing within Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore and nearby trails ...
