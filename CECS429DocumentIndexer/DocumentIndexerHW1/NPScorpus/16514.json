NPS\/Neal Herbert  The National Park Service, in partnership with Resource Systems Group Inc. (RSG), is conducting a visitor use study at Yellowstone from August 4 through August 14, 2016. This park-wide data collection effort will be used to understand trends in the demographics, experiences, opinions, and preferences of visitors to Yellowstone. These data will help park managers to make decisions that reflect the experiences and needs of visitors both in the present and in the future. Survey administrators from RSG and Washington State University will be contacting visitors to participate in a mail-back survey. Randomly selected people will be asked to take a stamped, self-addressed survey packet with them to complete at the end of their trip in Yellowstone. Survey administrators will be intercepting people along inbound roadways at pre-identified, park-approved pull-outs. Survey administrators will be wearing yellow traffic safety vests and RSG baseball hats while working in the park. In order to fully participate, people must complete the questionnaire and drop it in any U.S. Postal Service mailbox. A final report will be available in 2017.",
