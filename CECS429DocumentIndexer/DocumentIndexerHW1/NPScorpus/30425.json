In the springtime, the park’s forests come alive with ephemeral (short-lived) wildflowers, especially in moist areas near creeks. Before the trees spread their leaves and block sunlight, the forest floor is a living canvas, painted with a variety of native wildflowers. Our woodlands are home to spring beauty, yellow trout lily, toothwort, hepatica, bloodroot, dwarf ginseng, Virginia bluebells, spring cress, purple cress, rue anemone, foam flower, twin leaf, bishop's cap, squirrel corn, violets, jack-in-the-pulpit, several species of trillium, and a host of others. In mid-to late-summer, park fields transform into vibrant patches of blooming goldenrod and asters. Most commonly, Canadian goldenrod, grass-leaved goldenrod, New England Aster, and callico aster enliven the fields with their colorful blooms.       NPS COLLECTION",
