The Old Guard supports Fort Larned primarily through fundraising to promote history and interpretation at the park.  The Old Guard has been instrumental in acquiring entrance signs, as well as historic items such as the 1870s ambulance and historic rifles.  One of their most important historic preservation efforts has been protecting the site of the Cheyenne village destroyed by General Hancock in 1867 For more information, including how to become a member, visit the Fort Larned Old Guard website. Thank you for your support of Fort Larned National Historic Site!       The Old Guard's annual meeting, the Mess & Muster, features special talks and programs about Fort Larned's history.Â  In this program from 2011, members are listening to a program about the Cheyenne-Sioux Indian village at the actual village site, which the Old Guard purchased and takes care of for the park.       The Outpost is the official newsletter of the Old Guard, with news and information about Old Guard activities, as well as stories on the history of Fort Larned and the Santa Fe Trail.  We invite you to explore these issues to learn more about the Fort's history and what the Old Guard does to support Fort Larned.",
