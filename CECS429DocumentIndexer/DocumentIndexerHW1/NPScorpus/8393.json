Â    Managing a national park is a complex task that involves skilled professionals from many fields. Park management is not achieved by merely relying on experience and instincts. Whenever possible it is based on solid scientific research, conducted not only by park staff, but by universities and independent researchers as well. Financial constraints are always an issue while managing our national parks. At Cape Lookout National Seashore, there are natural and cultural resources, and numerous historic structures that are managed within the 56 miles of seashore. In all national parks, the need for efficient, innovative park management is especially important in order to protect the very best of this nation's rich heritage. And the law of the land dictates that, in turn, these resources, and the American public that own them, deserve the very best that the National Park Service can give them.",
