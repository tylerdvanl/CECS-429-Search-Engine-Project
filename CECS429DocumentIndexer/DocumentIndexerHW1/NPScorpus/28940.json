We were fortunate to hire four young people who attend school in the Hudson and Chatham school districts. They accomplished projects on site like landscape management work, helping to maintain the Dutch Farming Heritage Trail, removing invasive species at the Martin Van Buren Nature Trails, and assisting with house tours. They shadowed the interpretation and curatorial staffs as well as learned about sustainable agriculture through working with our neighbors at Roxbury Farm. The program was also a pilot effort to reach out to the variety of different communities of Hudson. In addition to hands-work experiences, the group was able to participate in numerous interactive learning experiences offered by many wonderful educational organizations and individuals in Columbia County and nearby. Among our cooperators this year were the Cornell Cooperative Extensions, the Sylvia Center, Fran Martino, Thomas Cole National Historic Site, Iroquois Indian Museum, and the Columbia Land Conservancy. The group also had the opportunity to visit National Parks outside of Columbia County. They traveled to Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia to experience the drama of American history, and to the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area to enjoy the outdoors by hiking and camping. We are very excited to continue this program next summer and hope to expand through increasing the number of youth hires, developing a more extensive set of college and career ready skills, participating more in-depth with projects for community partners, and providing additional leaderships and community outreach opportunities. Keep and eye out here and on our Facebook page http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MartinVanBurenNationalHistoricSite  for updates concerning recruitment for next year. In the meantime, if you are a student at Hudson High School, we are hosting a community dialogue group to provide open discourse on relevant local issues while learning about their relation to the monumental events that happened during President Van Buren's lifetime-the era between the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. contact kayla_altland@nps.gov for more information about this opportunity or come to our first meeting Tuesday, Sept. 22 at 3 pm in  Room 54 at Hudson High School.",
