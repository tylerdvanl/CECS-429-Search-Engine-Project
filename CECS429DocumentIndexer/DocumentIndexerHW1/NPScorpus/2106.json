The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract.\" - Abraham Lincoln, Gettysburg Address 1863 Places have power. Their names, their landscapes, or even the way the air smells may evoke feelings in the visitor. Tumacácori is not an island in the region but instead part of an assemblage of missions, ranches, and military presidios that changed the face of the Pimería Alta. Even the name \"Arizona\" is steeped in cultural and linguistic mystery.",
