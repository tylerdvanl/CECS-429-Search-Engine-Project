Please note: A section of this trail (from Jaggar Museum south to Keanakāko‘i Crater) is closed due to the current eruption in Halema‘uma‘u Crater. Hiking here is an awe inspiring journey through an active volcano. The breath of gasses and steam bear witness that Pelehonuamea (Pele of the sacred land) still resides here. Rich with native plant and animal life, active volcanism, and Hawaiian deities of a living culture, hikers will marvel at diverse scenic vistas, desert terrain, and lush rain forest.        Steam Vents Along the Crater Rim Trail NPS Photo  Of interest: Plants, birds, insects, desert, rain forest, steam vents, caldera, craters.  Difficulty: Challenging Distance and hiking time: 11-mile loop (the section from Jaggar Museum south to Keanakāko‘i Crater is closed due to the current eruption), all day (allow ½ hour per mile plus stopping and viewing time) Elevation: 4,000' Hikers may access the trail from many locations along Crater Rim Drive. Bring water and food. Be prepared for hot and dry, and wet and windy weather. Scorching sun, biting winds and pelting rain can occur in the same hour. Note: expect concentrated sulfur fumes are emitted from Halema'uma'u Crater and nearby areas. Hikers with asthma, heart or breathing problems should avoid these fumes. STAY ON MARKED TRAILS Cliffs, earthcracks, and steam vents have unstable and slippery edges. Keep well back for your safety.  Hiking over cracks and holes, loose rock, and thin lava crust greatly increases your risk of getting hurt.
