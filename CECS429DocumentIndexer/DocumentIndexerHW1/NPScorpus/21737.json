    "body": "Explore This Park    Get Involved     Support Your Park             Support Your Park       Supporting Noatak National Preserve is a different experience than in other places. For most people, Alaska is far away. To actually put your feet on the ground in the preserve, you have to charter a 4-seater airplane to get there. However, rangers still need help from people who love their national parklands. Caring about and contributing to public lands is an American ideal. Here is how you can help from near or far.   Volunteer There are many opportunities to support the work at Noatak National Preserve whether you live in the area or around the globe. See our volunteer page for more details. Donate You can make a gift to benefit the monument either directly to the National Park Service or through our cooperating association, Alaska Geographic. To make a gift directly to the National Park Service donation account, mail your check to the headquarters address. Learn More  Anyone can be a Jr. Ranger. Learning is the first step toward helping. Complete the activities in the Jr. Ranger book and mail them in. Not only will you be able to tell others what you learned about the parks in northwest Alaska, but you can also earn the Junior Ranger badge, saber toothed cat patch, and even a water bottle.",
