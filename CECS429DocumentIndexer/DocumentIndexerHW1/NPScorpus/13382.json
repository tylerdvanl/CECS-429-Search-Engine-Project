Yosemite covers 1,200 square miles and does not have a single address. We do not recommend using GPS units for directions in and around Yosemite. If you do use a GPS unit, just keep in mind that if there's a conflict between what the road sign says and what your GPS unit says, the road sign is correct (and your GPS unit isn't).  Gas is available at Wawona, Crane Flat, and El Portal 24 hours per day with a credit card. Gas is no longer available in Tuolumne Meadows. Gas is not available in Yosemite Valley.Electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are located only in Yosemite Valley: one at the Village Garage, and the other at The Majestic Hotel in Yosemite (formerly The Ahwahnee).
