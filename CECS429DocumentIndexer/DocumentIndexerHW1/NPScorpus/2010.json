Horseback riding is a great way to experience the desert and explore parts of the desert that few get a chance to see.  In order to help preserve the fragile desert ecosystem, a few guidelines must be followed.  Entrance Fee must be paid at the Kris Eggle Visitor Center one of the self-registration stations Horse travel is only allowed in designated areas Stock must be fed weed free hay for one week prior to visit and during the entire stay Manure\/droppings must be cleaned up at campsites.  Horse trailers cannot be cleaned in the park Do not tie to trees, cacti, or any other vegetation or historic structures Limit riding groups to five horses maximum Please no riding for 48 hours after a soaking rain Stay on the designated trail  Please stop by the Kris Eggle Visitor Center or call (520) 387-6849 ext. 7302 for more information. Horse camping is available at Twin Peaks Campground   Currently, visitors may ride on certain existing, developed trails. In the future, we hope to offer more equestrian options. As always, horse use is allowed in the federally designated Wilderness sections of Organ Pipe Cactus.",
