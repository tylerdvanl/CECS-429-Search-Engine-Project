They are places where wild plants and animals live out their daily lives and where natural processes prevail; They are also areas for people to be spiritually refreshed and physically challenged. They are areas to enjoy. From our visits we gain rich experiences and memories, but in return we must remember to give these areas another day of unspoiled wildness.
