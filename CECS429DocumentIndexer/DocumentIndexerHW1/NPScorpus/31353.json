Capromeryx), American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), and giant tortoise (Hesperotestudo). These remains contain the Nation's only recorded discovery of a nursery herd (females and offspring) of Pleistocene mammoths, comprising at least 18 of the unearthed mammoths. Waco Mammoth is one of over 400 National Park Service units that, working with other partners, helps safeguard this nation's natural and cultural heritage.
