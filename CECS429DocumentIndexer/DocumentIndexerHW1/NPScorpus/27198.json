    "body": "Professional Development          Teacher-Ranger-Teacher Each year Congaree National Park accepts applications from teachers interested in a challenging and fun professional development opportunity at the park in the summer. Teacher-Ranger-Teachers (TRT) work with park rangers for 8-10 weeks to develop lesson plans focused on park resources. The teachers will learn ways to enhance their curriculum in multiple content areas using national parks. Assignments and projects will depend upon the individual hired and current park projects. Duties may include observing, preparing, and presenting educational or public programs, developing educational and interpretive materials and media, providing community outreach and working with other divisions in the park. Training in interpretation and the National Park Service mission will be provided. The park will also provide uniform shirts and a $3,000 stipend. Selected teachers must be willing to undergo a Federal background investigation. The nationwide TRT program focuses on teachers from schools with ethnically diverse student populations, who have had little or no experience with national parks or limited opportunity to explore them. Teachers from Title I schools are encouraged to apply. The park is not currently accepting TRT applications. A sample application form is below.
