Also called sonogram, spectral waterfall, voiceprint, or voicegram, a spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies in a sound that can be used to analyze the various calls of animals. The horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents frequency. The amplitude of a particular frequency at a particular time is represented by the intensity of color at each point in the image.
