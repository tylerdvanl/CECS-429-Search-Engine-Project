    "body": "Winter Drives and Viewpoints        The General's Highway offers great views of the park in winter. Kirk Wrenche       Winter is a great time to visit the park, but the weather is often unpredictable. Snow can fall suddenly at any time of year on park roads in higher elevations, accumulate rapidly, and linger for days or weeks. Be prepared with warm clothing, a sleeping bag, water, and emergency food in case you need to wait for the road to be plowed.  If you're planning a trip in snowy weather, be prepared for winter road conditions. Tire chains are often required in these parks, and chain advisories can be in effect for days after a storm. You may need to bring chains for your vehicle, even if you have four-wheel or all-wheel drive. Chains are also available for rent in nearby towns. Check the alerts and conditions page for the latest road conditions.        Generals Highway from the Foothills Entrance to Lodgepole Chains are often required here in winter.
