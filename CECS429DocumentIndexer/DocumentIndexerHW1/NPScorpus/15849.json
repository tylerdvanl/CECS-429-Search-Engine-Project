    "body": "Education         Volunteer Keith Thomas giving a program to students. National Park Service  School groups are welcome at George Rogers Clark National Historical Park. This park is free for all visitors. School visits typically include three programs at the park. First is the movie in the visitor center. This film is 30 minutes in length and tells the story of George Rogers Clark's capture of Fort Sackville in Vincennes. Second is the Clark Memorial program. This program is a recorded six-minute narrative presented by headphones within the Memorial. When coupled with a ranger introduction, the entire memorial experience lasts for 15 minutes. The third is a live program presented by a ranger or park volunteer in period dress of the 18th century. This program typically runs 15 to 20 minutes. School groups wishing to take full advantage of their visit should plan for a minimum tour time of one hour. Adding an extra 15 to 30 minutes will allow the park staff to better serve the group and offer more information and details without the group being rushed. Remember to include extra time for shopping at the gift store, perusing the museum, walking the grounds, lunch, and restrooms as none of these are scheduled in a one hour visit. All group visits must be arranged through the Vincennes\/Knox County Convention and Visitors Bureau (CVB). The CVB may be contacted at 1-800-886-6443. The CVB also can make reservations for other sites in Vincennes, provide information about restauraunts, picnic areas, and provide other information.
