Bryan Harry photo      The invertebrates found in our park come in an amazing variety of shapes and sizes!  Hermit crabs and snails abound in the rocky tidepool areas. The coral polyps live together in colonies joining together to make the coral reefs.  Reef inhabitants include sea cucumbers, sea urchins and sea slugs. In the anchialine ponds, tiny red shrimp can be found grazing on algae.  Above you, butterflies, dragonflies and other insects fly through the air.  All of the different habitats in the park have some type of invertebrate living there.",
