The forests of the park are northern deciduous hardwood forests, of which approximately 60% are mature (150-200 years old) and 40% are success ional (100-150 years old). The rolling forested hills, fields, and babbling brooks weave a natural tapestry that provides a sense of the 18th century pre-encampment landscape.",
