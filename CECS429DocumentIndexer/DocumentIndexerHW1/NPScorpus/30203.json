To celebrate the 100th anniversary of the U.S. National Park Service, we launched a new junior ranger program for all to learn about the importance of one of the country's most recognized public agencies.  You can download the new Centennial Junior Ranger Activity Book and then print it out to complete.  Fill out as much of the booklet as you can and then bring it to any National Park Service visitor center for a ranger to review.  Once we look it over, you'll receive your limited edition Junior Ranger Centennial Badge and the ranger will sign your certificate.  If you can't make it to a visitor center, you can also mail your completed booklet to us (mailing address can be found on page 3 of the booklet).  Be sure to include your return address so we can send you your badge. Enjoy this activity by yourself, with friends or with your family!

What did they eat? Where did they live? How do we know about these people that lived 2,000 years ago? Answers to these questions can be found by participating in the park's Junior Ranger program. Any child between the ages of 6 to 12 can become a Junior Ranger by answering questions in a booklet available at the Mound City Group Visitor Center. Answers can be found in the park's brochure, video, museum, and interpretive signs in the mound area and along trails. Upon completion of the activities, bring the booklet back to the Visitor Center and be awarded a Hopewell Culture Junior Ranger badge!  Once children have acheived the Junior Ranger badge, ask about our Junior Archeologist booklet to extend your child's knowledge of the Hopewell culture, archeology and our national parks! Children will earn a Junior Archeologist badge. While the Junior Ranger program may be tailored for children of specific ages, we encourage visitors of all ages to participate in the program to expand their Hopewellian knowledge! Just ask a Ranger for your booklet during your visit.          Become a Junior Archeologist!  When most people think of archeology, they think of an adventurous explorer who braves great danger to grab a precious object! Archeology provides a link to the past and a means to study to the people who came before us. Junior Archeologists are important people because they help archeologists take care of very special places. The Junior Archeologist program is an opportunity for children to learn about the archeology at Hopewell Culture National Historical Park and have fun at the same time! In order to earn the badge and complete the requirements, children ages 5 -12 must participate in a Junior Archeology Day. Time: 10:00 a.m. - 12:00p.m.  Dates: September 3 and 17, and October 1 and 15 Place:  Mound City Group visitor center Children will be able to participate in many hands-on activities, including a mock dig to earn a Junior Archeologist badge!
