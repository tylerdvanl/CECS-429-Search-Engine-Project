A noticeable decrease in amphibians has been attributed to crayfish predation. Crayfish are continually introduced to the Santa Monica Mountains because of their utilization as fishing bait. What you can do! Cease buying crayfish as fishing bait and encourage other fishers to do the same! Talk with local legislators to have crayfish banned as bait in the area and be sure to decontaminate all fishing equipment before entering the National Recreation Area.",
