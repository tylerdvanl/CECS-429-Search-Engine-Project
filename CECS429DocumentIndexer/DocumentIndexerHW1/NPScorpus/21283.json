This provides for a wide range of wildlife from eagles to Tiger salamanders and from mountain lions to beetles. The most visible animals for park visitors are birds such as the Chickadee and Stellar's Jay and also smaller mammals such as Richardson's ground squirrels, Abert's squirrels. and rabbits.
