Some species of migrating sea birds come to the preserve to lay eggs at rookery sites along the  the northwest coast of the preserve. The bedrock cliffs at Sullivan Bluffs offer sea birds, including kittwakes, murres, and horned puffins, a secure nesting site for their young. The arrival of birds to the cliffs at Sullivan  Bluffs has brought humans to the area for hundreds of years. Alaska Natives living a traditional subsistence  lifestyle have passed down the knowledge of gathering sea bird eggs to the next generation. Even today,  gathering sea bird eggs represents just one of the many ways people still interact with the natural features  of the preserve.",
