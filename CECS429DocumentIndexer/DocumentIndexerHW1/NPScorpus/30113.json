    "body": "Laws & Policies       Firearms Information  As of February 22, 2010, a new federal law allows people who can legally possess firearms under applicable federal, state, and local laws, to legally possess firearms on lands owned by the National Park Service in this Park. Federal law also prohibits firearms in certain facilities in this Park; those places are marked with signs at all public entrances.  Firearms and other dangerous weapons* are not permitted in any building on park grounds (Please call the U.S. Air Force to inquire about concealed carry at Huffman Prairie Interpretive Center). Refer to Section 512 of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, Public Law 111-24, 123 Stat. 1764-65 (last section, bottom of document). Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park is a partnership of private non-profits and other Federal agencies with the National Park Service (NPS). The National Park Service owns or leases relatively little of the lands and historic buildings making up the Park. This limits the effect of the changes made by Public Law 111-24. The following is a listing of each of the five units of the Park that are open for public visitation with the anticipated effect of the change in law. 1. Wright-Dunbar Interpretive Center and Wright Cycle Company  (16 S. Williams St., Dayton)   The NPS owns or leases almost this entire site. However, most exhibits, activities, and programs are indoors in buildings that are “Federal facilities” and covered by a government-wide rule prohibiting firearms in “Federal facilities.” (18 USC 930 (g) (1)) 2. Huffman Prairie Flying Field and Huffman Prairie Flying Field Interpretive Center  (on Wright-Patterson Air Force Base) These sites are owned by the U.S. Air Force and Air Force rules control possession of firearms at these locations. Please check with Wright-Patterson AFB before bringing firearms to these locations. 3. Paul Laurence Dunbar State Memorial  (219 North Paul Laurence Dunbar St.) This site is owned by the State of Ohio and is covered by Ohio state government rules prohibiting firearms in “State facilities.” 4. Hawthorn Hill and   5. Wright Brothers Aviation Center at Carillon Historical Park   These sites are owned by private not-for-profit organizations. Ohio law controls the possession of firearms in these locations.  It is the responsibility of visitors to understand and comply with all applicable state, local, and federal firearms laws before entering this Park. Check with the State of Ohio website for more information.  * The term \"dangerous weapon\" means a weapon, device, instrument, material or substance, animate or inanimate, that is used for, or is readily capable of, causing death or serious bodily injury, except that such term does not include a pocket knife with a blade of less than 2&1\/2\" in length. 18 US Code 930, g2.",
