    "body": "Sunflower Star         Â    Common Name  Sunflower Star  Scientific Name Pycnopodia helianthoides  Habitat Near-shore sand and rocky bottom.  Additional Information The magnificent sunflower star inhabits low intertidal and subtidal areas ranging from Alaska to San Diego, California. Juvenile stars begin life with 5 arms, but once mature, adults have close to 24! They have very soft, spongy skin that comes in a kaleidoscope of colors - purple, green, brown, orange, pink and yellow. They are the largest sea star in the kelp forest reaching lengths of over a meter from tip to tip.  The sunflower star is a voracious predator often traveling up to 40 inches per minute to chase down its prey. This unique species of sea star has a skeleton composed of disconnected pieces. This allows for them to open their mouths wide enough to engulf large prey. They eat sea urchins, snails, clams, sea cucumbers, crabs and even other sea stars.",
