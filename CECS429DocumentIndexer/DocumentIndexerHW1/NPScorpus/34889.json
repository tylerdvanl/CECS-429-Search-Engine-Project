The nearest gas station is in Corinne, 26 miles east via highway 83. Travelers coming in from the east, out of Logan Utah, will pass the last available gas station in Tremonton traveling on Highway 102. Any travelers coming in from Idaho on Interstate 84 will pass the last available gas in Snowville Utah, when they take the Highway 83 exit to Golden Spike. Visitors relying on GPS Units, in order to direct them to our site, need to be cautious once they turn off State Highway 83. These systems have misdirected several visitors headed to our site. Road signs are more reliable as you approach the site.  Food Services If you plan to spend several hours visiting, bring food and drink - visitor center only has water and snack food for purchase. Other Conditions Be prepared for any type of weather; mosquitoes can be a nuisance. If you have any questions, please contact the Visitor Center (435) 471-2209 ext. 29.",
