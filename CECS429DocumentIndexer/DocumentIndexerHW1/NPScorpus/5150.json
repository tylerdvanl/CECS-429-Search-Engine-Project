It is important, however, to remember that the park is their home, and humans are just visitors. For their safety and yours, please follow these basic guidelines:   Never approach the wildlife. Respect their space and keep a safe distance between you and the wildlife. Never feed the wildlife. By feeding animals they become dependent on human food, which can lead to dangerous situations between humans and animals. Don't leave food at a campsite or picnic site; store food in the trunk of a car, if possible. Clean up all food scraps from your site and don't leave garbage around over-filled garbage cans. Report sick or injured wildlife to the park communication center at (800) 543-4295; don't try to help them on your own. Sick or injured animals may attack out of fear. Never remove any wildlife from the park. Keep pets on a 6 foot leash to protect both them and the local wildlife. Stay on designated trails. It is easier to see and avoid unwanted encounters. Watch your step to avoid stepping on small animals, like snakes. Snakes seldom strike unless trampled or bothered and can be camouflaged in leaves and other debris. Don't put your hands where you can't see them.",
