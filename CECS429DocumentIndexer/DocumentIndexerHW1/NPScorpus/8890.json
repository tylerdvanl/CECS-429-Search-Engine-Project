By painting landscapes of the American West, nineteenth century artists publicized many of the natural wonders of a land little known to eastern residents. This body of work helped to stimulate the establishment of many of our National Parks and to foster a continuing appreciation of them. Today's artists continue to document the resources of the National Park system with contemporary approaches and techniques, drawing upon the scenic, historic, and cultural elements of the parks for inspiration. These artists translate the parks' purpose as places of pleasure and preservation, into images that bring other people new insights, enjoyment and understanding.

It provides resident artists the opportunity to capture the moods of Sleeping Bear Dunes in their particular medium. The program provides rent-free use of a park house located in the vicinity of the village of Empire (no pets). You may also choose to stay in a campsite in one of the developed mainland campgrounds. Two 3-week residencies are available during September and October. The artist is asked to donate to the park an original piece of work representative of their medium, produced during the residency, and to contribute to the advancement of the park's mission. This is done by sharing knowledge with the public during the final week of the residency through a workshop, demonstration, reading, slide talk, etc. In addition, the artist must be willing to interact with park visitors when contacts are made in the field while working. Donated works will be displayed in the park or shared with the public through other appropriate means. These works will characterize the Lakeshore for present and future generations. Offering the public an opportunity to experience our national heritage through the eyes, ears and talents of the contributing artists fulfills one of the program's main purposes. The artist will be enrolled in the Volunteers In Park (VIP) Program of the National Park Service.        \"Empire View of Sleeping Bear\"Oil over acrylic Larry Vienneau, Artist-In-ResidenceSeptember, 1999  Selection Process A jury of park representatives and local subject matter experts will select from the pool of applicants.
