On February 24, 2016, the Proposed Rule for Dog Management in the GGNRA opened for a 60-day public comment period on www.regulations.gov (RIN 1024-AE16).  The comment period was later extended to 90 days and ended on May 25, 2016. The Proposed Rule is an important step forward in the dog management planning process that ensures the protection of park resources and provides recreational opportunities for a wide variety of park users. Please see below for a brief list of frequently asked questions about the Proposed Rule.       Frequently Asked Questions   Why does GGNRA need a dog management plan\/rule?   Since GGNRA was established in 1972, annual visitation to the park (including Muir Woods and Fort Point) has grown from around 1.4 million to over 17.5 million visitors. At the same time, dog walking in the park has increased dramatically. GGNRA must establish a Dog Management Plan that looks to the future. The Proposed Rule would provide a safer and more balanced park experience for all visitors. The National Park Service seeks to reduce current and future conflicts by providing space for all types of users, to protect park resources, and to clarify where and how park visitors can enjoy the park with their dogs - ensuring GGNRA remains the most dog friendly park in the nation.   What is the Proposed Rule?   The Proposed Rule would amend the park's special regulations designating 22 locations for dog walking in the GGNRA.  It is based on the Preferred Alternative described in the Draft Dog Management Plan\/Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) that was reviewed and commented on by the public in 2013\/14. The Proposed Rule would identify where and how people would be able to enjoy the park with their dogs - both on and off leash – as well as places that would be dog free. It also defines terms like “voice and sight control” that are essential to dog management. If ultimately implemented, the rule would ensure the protection of park resources and provide recreational opportunities for a wide variety of park users.   Visit www.regulations.gov to view\/comment on the Proposed Rule (RIN 1024-AE16).         What park areas would be open to dogs under the Proposed Rule? Under the Proposed Rule, the GGNRA would remain the most dog-friendly National Park, designating the only recreational dog walking opportunities for off leash dog walking in any of the 410 units in the National Park System. By comparison, dogs are not allowed off leash on neighboring California State Park Department lands or in San Mateo County Parks where they offer limited on leash dog walking opportunities.   Off leash dog walking would be allowed in 7 areas distributed among 5 park locations including Fort Funston, the most popular dog walking area in the park. Dog walking would be allowed on almost one-third of the park’s beach mileage, mostly off leash. One-third of the park’s trail mileage would be available for visitors to walk their dogs on leash. Picnic areas and beaches would include dog-free options. Specific areas would be identified for commercial dog walking.  Click here to see the maps under the Proposed Rule.          How does the Proposed Rule help protect wildlife and native plants? The GGNRA is home to over 1,273 plant and animal species (37 of which are rare, threatened, or endangered). The park considered impacts to these plants and animals when designating areas where dogs would be permitted. For example, areas with sensitive wildlife or plants were designated as either off limits to dogs or for dogs on leash only. Once a dog rule is implemented, regulations related to the impact of dog walking activities on natural resources would be monitored for compliance.      Where can I get copy of the Proposed Rule?   The Proposed Rule for Dog Management in the GGNRA can be downloaded on the web at www.regulations.gov (RIN 1024-AE16). To have a hard copy of the Proposed Rule mailed to you, please call the Dog management Information Line (415) 561-4728 or e-mail us.  How do I comment on the Proposed Rule?  The Proposed Rule is now open for a 90 day public comment* period from February 24th through May 25, 2016 (Comment period was extended from 60 to 90 days on February 24, 2016).  Comments* can be submitted:    On the web at www.regulations.gov (RIN 1024-AE16) - OR - Via Letter to: Superintendent, GGNRA, Attn: Dog Management Proposed Rule, Building 201 Fort Mason, SF, CA 94123.  *Due to federal regulations, comments cannot be accepted over the phone or via email. Bulk comments submitted on behalf of others in any format will not be accepted.  Click here to review “Tips for Submitting an Effective Comment.\"    Will there be Public Meetings?   The Golden Gate National Recreation Area (GGNRA) hosted six public informational meetings on the Proposed Rule for Dog Management in the GGNRA between March 22-31, 2016. Over 600 people participated in these meetings in Marin, San Francisco, and San Mateo Counties. At these meetings, there were opportunities for the public to learn about the Proposed Rule, ask questions, and speak individually with park staff as well as briefly to the assembled group if desired.     Click on this link for a video recording (along with other information) of the public meetings.  What happens to my comment and what happens next in this process?  All substantive comments on both the SEIS and Proposed Rule will be documented and responded to in a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). These comments along with relevant data, expert opinions, and other facts accumulated during the SEIS and Proposed Rule stages will be evaluated to determine whether the proposed solution will help accomplish the goals and solve the problems identified in the SEIS before moving forward with a Final Environmental Impact Statement, Record of Decision, and Final Rule.
