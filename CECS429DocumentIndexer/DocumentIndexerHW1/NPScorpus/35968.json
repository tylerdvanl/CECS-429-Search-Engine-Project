Permits will be issued in person only, during normal visitor center hours, and may be obtained the day of, or the day before the proposed trip. Due to the time involved, please be ready to begin the process at the visitor's center no later than 4:15 pm. Please be sure to have your driver's license ready, your itinerary, and your vehicle's license plate number. This will help to expedite the process and have you ready for the trails! General Restrictions and Regulations Permits are issued on a first come, first serve basis. During peak visitation periods permits may be in demand, so plan an alternative itinerary. The permit authorizes camping only on designated sites in the established backcountry campgrounds. You must choose your campground(s) at the time the permit is issued. Tents must be pitched on hardened tent pads available at all campgrounds. Fires are strictly prohibited (no wood or charcoal). Containerized fuel is the only allowable method to be used for both cooking or warming. Pets are not permitted in the backcountry. There are no water stations along the trails and all park water sources are protected and must not be disturbed. Please plan to pack in all water needed for your hike. It is recommended to bring one gallon of water per person, per day. Use Limits To minimize resource impact, all backcountry campground use limits are based on a standard of: -No more than 4 persons per campsite, with either one large tent or two small tents. -No more than 2 consecutive nights may be spent at any given campground. -Backcountry use permits are issued for a maximum of seven nights.

Â    Special Use Activities Special Use Permits are required for short-term activities that take place in the park area which provide a benefit to an individual, group or organization, rather than the public at large. Such activities require written authorization and some degree of management control from the NPS in order to protect park resources and the public interest; and are not prohibited by law or regulation. Examples of special park uses include weddings, first-amendment activities, events such as a bike race or meeting, group activities (groups of 20 or more participants) and non-profit organization activities. Please allow two weeks for the processing of permit applications.
