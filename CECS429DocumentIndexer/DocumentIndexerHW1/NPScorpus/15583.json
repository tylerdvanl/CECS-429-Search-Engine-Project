Our volunteers help make history come alive throughout the year.       Fort Larned's friend's group, the Fort Larned Old Guard, provides support by donating funds and materials to help us carry out our mission.          Volunteers dressed as soldiers demonstrate the Army ceremony known as Flag Retreat, or lowing the flag for the day.        Old Guard members get ready to enjoy dinner at their annual meeting, the Mess & Muster. NPS",
