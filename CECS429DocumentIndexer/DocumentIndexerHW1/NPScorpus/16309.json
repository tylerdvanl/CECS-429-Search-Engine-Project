    "body": "Volunteer Angler Report Card - Please Complete and Return!       Each year since 1979, Yellowstone has asked anglers to keep records on fishing trips, including the stream or lake visited, time spent fishing, fish species caught, lengths of fish, and so forth. The long-term database this has created, enables park managers to better understand fisheries status and track changes in specific populations from year-to-year.  When purchasing a Yellowstone National Park fishing permit, you will be provided with a Volunteer Angler Report (VAR) card, along with a copy of the regulations.  The card should be completed for each trip to a single stream or lake, and can be dropped off at a park Ranger Station or Visitor Center, or returned by mail (postage paid).  Keep in mind that the information you provide on each card should be only for one stream or lake-please don't mix information from multiple locations! Hopefully you will need additional VAR cards for trips to several streams or lakes over several days! Thank you for supporting our fisheries management program by returning these cards to park biologists!   Back to main Fishing page",
