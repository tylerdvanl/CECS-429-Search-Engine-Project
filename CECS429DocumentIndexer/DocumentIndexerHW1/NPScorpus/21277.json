    "body": "Long Lake Fish Weir        The Long Lake population has the longest known annual spawning duration (August through April) of any sockeye salmon population in North America. Throughout the winter, sockeye spawn in the northwest corner of the lake which rarely freezes.          The weir at the outlet of Long Lake has been in operation since 1974.   The weir at the outlet of Long Lake (on the McCarthy Road) has been in operation since 1974. Initially the Alaska Department of Fish and Game ran it. In 1976 Cliff Collins, a local private citizen who owned the land where the weir is located, voluntarily took over operation of the weir when ADFG was no longer able to fund its operation. He operated the weir continuously from 1976 through 2003. In 2003 when Mr. Collins, at age 93, was no longer able to operate the weir, a cooperative agreement was formed between the Collins’ Family Trust, Wrangell-St. Elias National Park\/Preserve and the Copper River Watershed Project to continue to keep the weir operating. Since 2004, funding has been by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of Subsistence Management. Starting in 2003 the weir operators began sampling sockeye salmon for age, sex, and length composition as well as counting the number of sockeye migrating into Long Lake. Over forty years of weir data show annual variations in abundance of Long Lake runs ranging from 4,400 to over 50,000 sockeye. This is the longest running data set of weir counts of salmon in the Copper River drainage. The sockeye salmon stock that spawns within Long Lake is the largest salmon stock within the Chitina River drainage.      Count Totals 1974-2014     YEAR   SALMON     2014   16,778     2013   14,494     2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005   25,736 12,885 10,876 4,555 631 7,486 9,239 7,770     2004   19,215     2003   4,604     2002   50,000     2001   26,939     2000   8,665     1999   12,922     1998   8,531     1997   4,433     1996   6,209     1995   17,933     1994   18,289     1993   16,101     1992   10,141     1991   11,501     1990   21,399     1989   17,760     1987   7,065     1986   13,323     1985   21,431     1984   10,729     1983   28,003     1982   28,064     1981   12,687     1980   39,978     1979   46,110     1978   15,458     1977   8,772     1976   24,689     1975   6,786     1974   4,501",
