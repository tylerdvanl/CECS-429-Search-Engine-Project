While most of that investment comes from the general tax base, those who use these areas for recreation derive a greater benefit from--and place a greater burden on--resources than the public at large. These individual park fees redistribute that burden so that users pay an increased share of the costs. We encourage you to participate in recreational activities; such experiences will enhance your visit and create memories. But we also ask you to remember your role in keeping the experience alive for others.  There are many projects that the fee monies will be applied to such as repairs and improvements to roads, buildings, and trails. Fee money goes toward improved signs and exhibits. Educational programs, ranger-guided programs, and other visitor activities receive funds from fee money collected. Natural habitat protection as well as stabilization and restoration of historic structures can be enhanced thanks to fee monies. We thank you for your support of the Johnstown Flood National Memorial and the National Park Service.",
