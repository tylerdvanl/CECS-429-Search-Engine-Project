This large circular pueblo was from an earlier occupation dating to about 1300. This pueblo, centered around a central kiva, was occupied until about 1400, when it was mostly abandoned. Later, the rectangular shaped pueblo of Mound 7 was built on top of the remains of this earlier circular pueblo. Today, there is a deeper room of Mound 7 that has been excavated to show the lower circular pueblo.  This room is visible from the top of Mound 7 during your next trip to the Gran Quivira unit of Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument.       The Circular Pueblo visible below Mound 7 today.
