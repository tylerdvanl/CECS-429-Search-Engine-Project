Rangers continually research and prepare numerous programs, exhibits, media and special events to evoke interest and provide information on a variety of topics. They also work with park partners in the community to reach visitors outside our boundary. Formal and Informal Interpretation Formal programs include organized talks, tours, and hikes. Rangers provide specific information about a given topic such as battle tactics, civil war artillery, etc. Informal interpretation is sharing information in a less structured atmosphere like roving trails and talking with visitors on a more casual level. Special Events Special events frequently focus upon particular themes that appeal to new or specific audiences. Some commemorate events that relate to park stories. Some highlight topics that relate to other sites within the area and provide opportunities for people to enrich their experience by visiting multiple sites. Others expand perspectives for understanding the past and offer deeper appreciation for park resources. Collections Management \/ Archives Monocacy National Battlefield manages a wealth of objects and information in its museum, archives and library collection. These collections are used to prepare exhibits and interpretive programs. A college intern and park volunteer are working with park staff to archive interpretive files including research from an array of repositories, copies of soldier letters and diaries, newspaper and magazine articles, Community Outreach Program The park collaborates with the Frederick Historic Sites Consortium, the Tourism Council of Frederick County, the Journey through Hallowed Ground National Heritage Area, the Heart of the Civil War Heritage Area, and other community partners that share a rich cultural heritage that provide additional visitor experiences. Junior Ranger\/Education programs Rangers create and revise activities to help young visitors understand and appreciate park resources. We believe this is especially important in creating a new generation of park stewards. Download the Junior Ranger booklet. Media and Exhibit Development Rangers continually research, plan, and develop a wide variety of media from brochures and booklets, to podcasts and web-related materials.
