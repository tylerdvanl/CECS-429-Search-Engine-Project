Visitors can drive the 2 1\/4-mile self-guiding automobile tour. An in-car narrated CD or cassette tour of the park (allow 2 hrs.) is available for sale in the bookstore.

Please be careful when crossing Old Battleground Road and New Garden Road. Remember to travel the correct direction on the one way tour road, wear your helmet, and always yield to pedestrians. Walking  Those who enjoy hiking can take advantage of the 2.5 miles of battlefield walking trails. Remember, you are in a National Park and may encounter wildlife on your journey. Never feed or approach any of the wildlife and report any unusual animal behavior to park staff. However you decide to tour this special place, you will be able to enjoy the outdoors and see history come to life! Monuments  Twenty-eight monuments within the park honor Revolutionary soldiers, statesmen, heroes, and heroines. William Hooper and John Penn, two of North Carolina's three signers of the Declaration of Independence, are buried under the Signers' Monument. A large equestrian statue of General Nathanael Greene dominates the monument honoring the soldiers of the Southern Army and its leader.

Stay on park trails and avoid woods and tall grass. Snakes live in the park, too. Please do not feed the wildlife. If you see strange animal behavior please report it to a park ranger immediately.
