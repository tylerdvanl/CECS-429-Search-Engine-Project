An audio tour of the park's scenic road is available for purchase or rental at the bookstore. Recorded descriptions of exhibits or waysides are not available. Service Animals Service animals are allowed in national parks. For a definition of a service animal, please go to www.ada.gov\/service_animals_2010.htm. Service animals are permitted everywhere at Arches. Owners are encouraged to identify their working service animal, such as with a vest. Identification is not required, but helps prevent unwarranted \"dog on trail\" complaints from other visitors. There are no plastic bags provided at trailheads for waste products, so please bring your own. Caution! The desert can be deadly for pets. Car temperatures rise quickly in the sun, even on cool days. Your pet can easily die of heat exhaustion. If you are leaving a pet in a car, crack the windows as much as possible and leave water to drink. We recommend you not leave pets in the car at all when the outside temperature exceeds 68 degrees, even with the windows cracked.",
