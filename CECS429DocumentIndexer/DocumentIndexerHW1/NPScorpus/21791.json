NPS Photo\/Cait Johnson       One of our biggest challenges is finding a way to share the Noatak National Preserve's experience with those who do not have the opportunity to visit the park in person. We have created a Flickr account as a way to extend the virtual park boundary to encompass all those who love and support our national parks, wherever they may be. Any visitor who would like to volunteer a sample of a trip to Noatak National Preserve is encouraged to visit our Flickr site to post photos, video clips and journal entries to share with others.                   Noatak National Preserve   81 Photos  Check out photos taken inside Noatak National Preserve          Noatak National Preserve   90 Photos  Landscapes, trips, and projects          Fantastic Landscapes     26 Photos  Noatak National Preserve has a wealth of beautiful vistas            Adventures of an Education Specialist   28 Photos  Ever wonder what adventures you might find traveling to remote villages in northwest Alaska?
