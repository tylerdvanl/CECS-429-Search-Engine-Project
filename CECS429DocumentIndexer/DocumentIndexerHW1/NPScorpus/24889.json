A curriculum based ranger program can help you and your students meet grade level expectations. Ranger programs are an excellent tool to introduce or review a subject with your students.  Rangers will visit classes in the Bering Strait School District and Nome Public Schools.  Hands-on activities and multimedia presentations keep students engaged in the program activities. Techniques such as cooperative learning, problem based learning, and resource immersion challenge students to explore topics more deeply.  Ranger programs also provide an opportunity to bring topical issues into the classroom learning environment while addressing Alaska curriculum standards.
