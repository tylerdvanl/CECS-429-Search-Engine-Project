Despite being often overlooked, reptiles are vital components of southeastern ecosystems. They can serve important roles as both predators and prey, forming critical trophic links in many ecosystems, and can serve as indicators of environmental integrity. Comprehensive accounts of regional species composition and richness are fundamental to initiating meaningful monitoring or research programs applicable to conservation issues. Up to 60 species of reptiles could possibly occur on the Outer Banks. According to investigations of reptile occurrences on the Outer Banks (Tuberville et al. 2005, Gaul and Mitchell 2007), 59 species of reptiles have been documented in Dare County, North Carolina since 1588. Of these, 32 species of reptiles have been documented at Cape Hatteras National Seashore.          Observed In Park Scientific Name Common Name      Alligators    Yes Alligator mississippiensis American alligator          Turtles    Yes Chelydra serpentina Common snapping turtle    Chrysemys picta Eastern painted turtle   Yes Clemmys guttata Spotted turtle    Deirochelys reticularia Eastern chicken turtle   Yes Kinosternon subrubrum Eastern mud turtle   Yes Malaclemys terrapin Diamondback terrapin    Pseudemys concinna Eastern river cooter    Pseudemys floridana Florida cooter   Yes Pseudemys rubriventris Red-bellied turtle    Sternotherus odoratus Common musk turtle   Yes Terrapene carolina Eastern box turtle   Yes Trachemys scripta Yellow-bellied slider          Sea Turtles    Yes Caretta caretta Loggerhead sea turtle   Yes Chelonia mydas Green sea turtle   Yes Dermochelys coriacea Leatherback sea turtle   Yes Lepidochelys kempii Kemp's ridley          Lizards    Yes Anolis carolinensis Green anole   Yes Cnemidophorus sexlineatus Six-lined racerunner    Eumeces fasciatus Five-lined skink   Yes Eumeces inexpectatus Southeastern five-lined skink   Yes Eumeces laticeps Broadhead skink    Ophisaurus attenuatus Slender glass lizard    Ophisaurus mimicus Mimic glass lizard   Yes Ophisaurus ventralis Eastern glass lizard    Sceloporus undulatus Fence lizard   Yes Scincella lateralis Ground skink          Snakes     Agkistrodon contortrix Copperhead   Yes Agkistrodon piscivorus Cottonmouth    Carphophis amoenus Worm snake    Cemophora coccinea Scarlet snake   Yes Coluber constrictor Black racer   Yes Crotalus horridus Canebrake rattlesnake   Yes Diadophis punctatus Ringneck snake   Yes Elaphe guttata Corn snake    Elaphe obsoleta Rat snake    Farancia abacura Mud snake   Yes Farancia erytrogramma Rainbow snake   Yes Heterodon platirhinos Eastern hognose snake    Heterodon simus Southern hognose snake    Lampropeltis calligaster Mole kingsnake    Lampropeltis getula Eastern kingsnake   Yes Lampropeltis triangulum Scarlet kingsnake or milksnake    Masticophis flagellum Coachwhip    Nerodia erythrogaster Plainbelly water snake   Yes Nerodia fasciata Banded water snake   Yes Nerodia sipedon Northern banded water snake   Yes Nerodia taxispilota Brown water snake   Yes Opheodrys aestivus Rough green snake    Regina rigida Glossy crayfish snake    Rhadinaea flavilata Pine woods snake    Seminatrix pygaea Black swamp snake    Sistrurus miliarius Pigmy rattlesnake   Yes Storeria dekayi Brown snake    Storeria occipitomaculata Redbelly snake    Tantilla coronata Southeastern crowned snake   Yes Thamnophis sauritus Ribbon snake    Thamnophis sirtalis Garter snake    Virginia striatula Rough earth snake          References  Gaul, R.W. and J.C.
