The more adaptable cave crayfish Orconectes pellucidus occupies habitats ranging from base level to tiny streams, and can travel out of water if necessary. The troglophilic or partially cave adapted amphipod Crangonyx packardi, the crayfish Cambarus tenebrosus, the sculpin Cottus carolinae, and the springfish Chologaster agassizi often occur in organically rich situations. With the exception of sculpin, fish and crayfish are predators and the remaining species are primarily grazers.",
