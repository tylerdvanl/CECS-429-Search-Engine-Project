NPS Photo\/Tyler Teuscher  Sheefish, salmon, grayling, pike and Dolly Varden in the rivers are good to catch and good to eat. Local subsistence users may be fishing with set nets - give them a wide berth so they can complete their important harvest activities. Not much has been published on fishing or river conditions of this area because it is so remote. Visitors are on their own for most things, which is often why boaters come to this area. Generally, sheefish are more plentiful in the fall while grayling and pike are available year round. There should be a substantial salmon run in the river in the fall. Anglers are required to have a fishing license and follow Alaska state fishing regulations.",
