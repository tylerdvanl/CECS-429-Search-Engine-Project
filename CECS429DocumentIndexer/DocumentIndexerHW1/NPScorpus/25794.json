NPS photo\/B. Mayhew  Welcome to Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park! Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park is a collection of sites throughout the town of Skagway, Alaska and the surrounding area.  During the summer months (late May to mid-September) Skagway is a major cruise ship port.  Skagway can see up to 10,000 visitors a day, with at least one ship arriving every day.  During the Winter months (October to May) Skagway becomes a very quiet community.  Some visitors do arrive during these months via the state ferry or the Klondike highway, however, these visitors make up only a fraction of the total numbers. Please use our website to find information on:   Operating Hours & Seasons.  Klondike Gold Rush National Historical park is open year-round, though services available vary on season.  Most visitors come during the summer (May-September), but visiting in the winter offers small town charm and history. Fees & Passes Permits & Reservations.  Permits are needed to camp overnight on the Chilkoot Trail or to lead commercial tours in the park (including park museums). Skagway Weather is different than anywhere else in southeast Alaska.
