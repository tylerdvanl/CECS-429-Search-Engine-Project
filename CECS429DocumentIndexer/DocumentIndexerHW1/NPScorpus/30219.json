Some of the many spring flowers, such as spring beauty, bloodroot, Dutchmanâ€™s breeches, and yellow trout-lily, blossom before leaf out. During the summer, common milkweed, butterfly weed, black-eyed Susan, and purple coneflower brighten the landscape. Later in the year, goldenrod and white snake root accompany the autumn colors in the trees. Native prairie grasses and forbs have been planted at Hopewell Mound Group and Hopeton Earthworks. The wildflower show there is best in the summer when the prairie plants thrive despite the heat. Eventually, most of the park land will be converted to native grasslands.",
