The annual Rendezvous Days celebration at Grand Portage National Monument is supported, in part, through sales in the bookstore. Rendezvous Days would not be the same without the generous financial support of Eastern National and assistance from EN staff.          Cabinets display reproduction Jamestown glassware, ceramic mugs and clay pipes similar to artifacts uncovered by archeologists at Grand Portage National Monument.
