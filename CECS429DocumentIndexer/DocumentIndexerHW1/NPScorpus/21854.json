NPS photo  The Park Prescriptions Program was formed through a partnership between Sitka Community Hospital, SEARHC, and Sitka National Historical Park with the goal of helping improve Sitkans' health and wellness by encouraging residents to recreate within the park.  To participate in the Park Prescriptions Program, consult with your health care professional and ask about receiving a Park Prescriptions card.  Once the card has been prescribed to you, you can walk or run in the park on your own schedule - you will get a punch on your card for each day you exercise.  Upon completion, the card will be entered into a quarterly drawing.  Interested?  Watch this short video to learn more, or consult with your health care professional!
