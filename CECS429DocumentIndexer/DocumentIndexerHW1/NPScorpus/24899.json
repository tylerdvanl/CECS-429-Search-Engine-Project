A diverse, scenic geology is found throughout its 51 mile (82 km) length. It started as a normal, uplifted fault block mountain range and over time was slowly sculpted by wind, water, and glaciers. The artistry that came from these events includes steep valleys, glacial cirques, and exposed granite walls. Remote and rugged, its beauty is rarely seen by people today due to its remote location.",
