NPS Photo by N. Judd 04\/18\/08  Your next stop on the Crater Rim Drive Tour will be Jaggar Museum (the next left turn after leaving Kīlauea Overlook). This is one of the busiest locations in the park. Be careful when parking. Look out for nēnē, the endangered Hawaiian goose. The Thomas A. Jaggar Museum is a museum on volcanology with displays of equipment used by scientists in the past to study the volcano, working seismographs, and an exhibit of clothing and gear from scientists who got a bit too close to lava. There is also a gift shop with books, videos, cds, maps, and other special items for sale. The Museum has large windows which affords a sheltered view of the caldera and main crater, Halema'uma'u, when weather is inclement. The overlook outside the building offers an incredible view of the volcano with interpretive displays about Kīlauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes. The US Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory is adjoining the Jaggar Museum. It is not open to the public.       For more information about Jaggar Museum, please visit the \"Jaggar Museum & Halema'uma'u Overlook\" page.      Note: A portion of Crater Rim Drive, between Jaggar Museum and the Chain of Craters Road junction is closed indefinitely due to the fumes and ashfall from the vent that opened within Halemaʻumaʻu Crater in March 2008. The section of Crater Rim Drive from Chain of Craters Road to Keanakāko'i Crater is open to foot traffic.      Go to: Crater Rim Drive Tour - Stop #3 - Kīlauea Overlook      Return to: Crater Rim Drive Tour - main page Things to Do",
