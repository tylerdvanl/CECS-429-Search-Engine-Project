    "body": "Discover Dinosaur  Dinosaurs once roamed here. Their fantastic remains are still visible embedded in the rocks. Today, the mountains, desert and untamed rivers flowing in deep canyons, support an array of life. Petroglyphs hint at earlier cultures. Later, homesteaders and outlaws found refuge here. Whether your passion is science, adventure, history or scenery, Dinosaur offers much to explore.              Seeing Dinosaur Fossils   Visitors can see over 1,500 dinosaur fossils exposed on the cliff face inside the Quarry Exhibit Hall.",
