It offers a westward perspective for several miles beyond the entrance area of the park. Snow and extreme conditions may obscure the view at times. The image is set to refresh several times each minute.   Check out the alpine webcam on Mount Healy           Alaska Railroad Depot This view from high above the Denali Visitor Center is oriented to the southeast, across the park boundary in the middle distance to the Yanert River Valley beyond. In winter, this expanse is where the sun first emerges and lingers low over the horizon. (Image refreshes about once each minute.) Trains pass through the depot around noon and 4:30 pm each day in summer.  Check out the railroad depot webcam.             Resting Grizzly Regardless of season, \"Resting Grizzly\" by William Berry, located just outside the entrance to the Denali Visitor Center, may well be the most hugged and photographed work of art in all of Alaska.   Check out the Resting Grizzly webcam at the Denali Visitor Center           Sled Dog Puppies  August 2 update  Annie and Lucor's pups were born early in the morning on Saturday July 23, 2015. There are five healthy pups, three boys and two girls.   In honor of the NPS Centennial this year and the upcoming Centennial for Denali in 2017, we felt it was the perfect year for the \"Birthday\" themed litter.     We hope that these names remind you to celebrate our 100 year milestones the same way that our sled dogs approach every day - with boundless enthusiasm and passion for the work and play that they get to do in our parks every day.  We anticipate turning on the puppy cam on Monday, August 15.           Denali   Park researchers studying air quality operate a visibility webcam looking toward Denali from Wonder Lake, about 85 miles from the park entrance. The webcam archives high resolution photos for visibility documentation, and runs on solar power.           FAA Webcams: Eielson Visitor Center, Kahiltna Glacier and the Denali Park Airstrip  The FAA maintains webcams throughout Alaska, including three in Denali.   One is positioned on the Kahiltna Glacier, where most aspiring mountaineers land before starting a trip up the highest peak in North America. The other is at Eielson Visitor Center, located at Mile 66 of the Denali Park Road. The final camera is mounted at the airstrip near the park entrance, which is open to general aviation.",
