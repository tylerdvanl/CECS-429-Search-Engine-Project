Private boaters may not tie off to ladders, pillars or handrails, cannot use lines that are already attached to the pier (these are for the authorized tour boat and NPS operations), may not leave access gate to ladders open as this is a safety issue for all visitors to Fort Sumter. Again, plan to beach or anchor vessels on the western side of the fort.    Charter Boats Fort Sumter National Monument does not permit Charter Boats to operate at Fort Sumter.
