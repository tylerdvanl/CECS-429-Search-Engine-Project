    "body": "Downloading and Printing Photos       Downloading An Image  Click on \"View Album\" for the collection topic you want. Click on the image (or its title) you want to print or download. A separate window will open. Right click on the image. From the drop down window list choose “Save Picture” if you want to download the image or \"Print\" if you want to print directly from the site. If you want to download and save the image, enter the file location where the image is to be stored, name it, and click save.  NOTE: Image sizes vary. If you are a return user, please note that you are no longer able to download a variety of image sizes. The NPS's websites have recently been switched to a new content management system and at this time there is no option for providing alternate sizes. ABOUT OUR PHOTOS: The images in our photo albums are public domain and therefore have unrestricted use. If a photographer is listed, a credit is appreciated.",
