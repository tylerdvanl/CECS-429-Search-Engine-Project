Some postcards are images of art work from the Volcano School of art. Others are photographs that were strategically manipulated with bright orange and red to increase the dramatic look of Kīlauea Caldera and Halema‘uma‘u Crater. Still other images are illustrations or photographs softly hand painted to represent the natural and built environment of the park, or mass produced on linen paper by postcard publishers such as Curt Teich & Co. While looking at the postcards it is interesting to note the different names used for the park and the volcano; the use of Kilauea National Park represents the early interest in creating a national park that primarily encompassed Kīlauea Caldera. Some of the postcards were created by local Hawaii photographers such as Hilo resident I. Morihiro, who deftly hand-tinted his postcards with bright orange and red coloring. The selection of postcards is from the Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park Archive, HAVO 16084 Cultural Resource Management Collection, Box 62.",
