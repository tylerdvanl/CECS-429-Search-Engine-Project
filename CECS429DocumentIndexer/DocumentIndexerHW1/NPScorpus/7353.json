The trail leads to the rim through juniper shrubland above limestone plateaus to discover a  breathtaking view.  You can easily follow the trail markers along the ridge for several hundred feet, enjoying different views of the river carved canyon with every step. Just as the markers start directing you back to your vehicle, a small lizard disappears under a sagebrush reminding you to take one last look.",
