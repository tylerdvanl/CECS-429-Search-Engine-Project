NPS Photo \/ David Cooper       Grand Portage National Monument would not be nearly as successful without support from volunteers, partner contributions and the Eastern National sales outlet. By volunteering or supporting our partnerships at Grand Portage National Monument, you can become more involved in activities at your favorite areas managed by the National Park Service.        Chefs proudly show off the baked goods they have produced on the kitchen porch. NPS Photo  Volunteer Time is valuable. Perhaps you are a re-enactor interested in sharing your cultural and fur trade passion with families or groups or volunteering your time to interpret history of the fur trade and Native culture to visitors from many backgrounds and places. Perhaps your passion is books and library collections; the Monument is always in need of extra help in one of the finest fur trade and Ojibwe culture collections in the national parks. Whatever your skill or interest, please visit our volunteer page to discover what volunteer opportunities exist that may help you and the Monument achieve more ambitious goals.        Logo of the National Parks of Lake Superior Foundation NPSLF Logo  Partner Contributions National Parks of Lake Superior Foundation This friends group is a privately supported effort to fund special projects in the five U.S. national park units located on Lake Superior.
