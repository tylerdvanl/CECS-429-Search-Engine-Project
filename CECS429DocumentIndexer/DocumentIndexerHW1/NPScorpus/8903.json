It is a privilege and honor for us to serve as the management team for this beautiful National Park site. Sleeping Bear Dunes is one of the most scenic and publicly accessible portions of the Lake Michigan shoreline. We believe deeply in the National Park Service mission of preserving our nation's natural and cultural treasures for future generations. Some of the most prominent features of this Lakeshore includes forests, beaches, lakes, dune formations, and ancient glacial phenomena. These resources are of global importance due to their relatively unimpacted state, the variety of features, their proximity to each other, and their protected status. We invite you to enjoy the natural resources in all their splendor, while contemplating the wealth of cultural history that took place here too. Feel free to contact any of us if you have questions or concerns. Come to the Philip A. Hart Visitor Center in Empire or stop in at any of the ranger stations or campgrounds.",
