    "body": "Cataract Canyon        A raft hits the top of Big Drop Two during high water NPS Photo by Travis Poulson   Â    Cataract Canyon contains fourteen miles of rapids ranging in difficulty up to Class V. It is a particularly hazardous and isolated section of the Colorado River and is subject to extreme water level fluctuations. A permit is required for all trips through Cataract Canyon. People interested in boating through Cataract Canyon should also read about the flat water as these sections cannot be bypassed. Most Cataract Canyon trips put in at Potash, Moab, Green River, or Mineral Bottom. The usual take-out for Cataract trips is Hite Marina on Lake Powell. Boaters should be aware of lake conditions as they will affect the final day(s) of your trip. While hiking trails lead to the rivers from each of the districts, these trails are too long and rugged to be seriously considered for shuttles, even for inflatables and other lightweight boats. Zebra Mussel Advisory All boaters on Lake Powell must comply with Glen Canyon's zebra mussel regulations.",
