To celebrate both of these anniversaries, the Friends of Bandelier are hosting a Reunion Celebration at the Monument on Saturday, July 23, 2016.  We'll have some special tours during the day, and a dinner on the grounds along the creek behind the Visitor Center.  This event is open to everyone - present and previous staff, volunteers, partners, and those that have a special connection to Bandelier.  For our dinner we're honored to have Mary Burchill, author of Lady of the Canyon, who will share stories of Mrs Frey.  As a gift, all attendees will receive a commemorative replica plate from Mrs Frey's Frijoles Canyon Lodge.
