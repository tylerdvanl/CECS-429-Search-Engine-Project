With over 650 species of vertebrates and 3,600 species of insects, Big Bend is a living, breathing laboratory of biodiversity. Visitors see it in action daily, often reporting their encounters with javelinas, sighting a mother bear with cubs, or delighting in the antics of the roadrunner chasing its lizard prey. Below are summaries of black bear and mountain lion sightings, taken from wildlife sighting cards turned in by park staff and visitors. Remember, we can only list the sightings you report. Always report unusual sightings to a park ranger.       Monthly Bear and Mountain Lion Sighting Summary Reports  (Updated up to one month after the close of the reporting month) 2016 January February March April May June  July 2015 January February March April May June July August September October November December   2014 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2013 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2012 January February March April May June July August September October November  December 2011 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2010 January | February | March | April | May | June | July | August | September | October | November | December",
