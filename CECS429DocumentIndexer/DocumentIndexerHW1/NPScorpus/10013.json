These forts represent the value placed on the anchorages at Pensacola Bay, Florida and Ship Island, Mississippi. While the national seashore preserves forts that span a long period of defense, possibly the most striking among these are the American Third System forts: Fort Pickens, Fort Massachusetts, Fort Barrancas, and the Advanced Redoubt, all of which saw action during the Civil War.",
