    "body": "Partnerships          The Buffalo National River Partners was formed because of common interests in the Buffalo River. The goals of the Partners are to provide volunteer and financial resources to Buffalo National River which will assist with a variety of projects to enhance facilities, improve visitor experiences and preserve the unique natural and cultural features of the Buffalo National River.         HIKE! is a new partnership designed to connect young people to the natural environment, utilizing Newton County’s abundant outdoor recreational resources of Buffalo National River and the Ozark National Forest. HIKE! is made possible by a grant from the National Parks Foundation and Coca Cola. To make physical activity more of a way of life, HIKE! has worked to implement hiking trails to increase use of the wonderful hiking trails of Newton County.         Project Learning Tree (PLT) is an international curriculum that empowers teachers to inspire students and get them outside. PLT is a proven environmental education curriculum that teaches kids how to think not what to think about important environmental issues. PLT provides quality professional development for educators incorporating place-based learning featuring the flora, fauna, geology, and hydrology of the Buffalo National River. PLT is sponsored in the state by the Arkansas Forestry Association Education Foundation.         The Ponca Elk Education Center was created by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission to provide exhibits, activities, elk habitat and conservation information, as well as local history. The center works collaboratively with Buffalo National River by encouraging visitors to experience and enjoy the beauty of the area and partnering with park rangers to conduct programs for large school groups, and offer the use of our site for meetings and Jr. Ranger programs. Also, the center and Buffalo National River share the responsibility of encouraging \"Leave No Trace\" practices and managing the Arkansas Elk Program.         Imagine a green oasis that serves as a public park for the residents of Bentonville and beyond. This 6.5 acre garden has been developed into a native \/ woodland garden which is quickly becoming a regional destination garden and special events venue. Residents and visitors are able to take advantage of this beautiful and peaceful environment that contains a native plant collection. Compton Gardens and Conference Center are named after Dr. Neil Compton, a noted Bentonville physician, writer, photographer, founder of the Ozark Society, and initiated the efforts to stop the damming of the Buffalo River.",
