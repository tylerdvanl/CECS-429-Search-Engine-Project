NPS  The Trade Goods and Book Store at Bent's Old Fort offers many of the same trade goods that were exchanged for bison robes and other peltries at the fort in 1846. A visit to the store links you to the past when Bent's Fort was part of a thriving commercial trading empire. You can purchase replicas of the same goods offered by the Bent brothers and carried along the Santa Fe Trail. Items such as flint and steel, powder horns, and copper rum cups might have been supplies the mountain men needed; the Indians wanted trade beads and coffee; from Mexico came shells and baskets. Hand made leather pouches and blankets, Hudson Bay blankets and Dutch ovens are examples of goods offered for sale. In addition to trade goods, over 100 titles relating to the Fort, Native Americans, Sand Creek, mountain men, the fur trade, historical cooking, and the Santa Fe Trail are available for every age and level of study.  The store is operated by Western National Parks Association, a nonprofit organization authorized by Congress to assist the National Park Service in providing educational materials to park visitors.
