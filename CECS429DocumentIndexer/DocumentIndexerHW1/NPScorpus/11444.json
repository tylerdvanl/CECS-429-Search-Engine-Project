This is your opportunity to help create a vision for the future of Tule Lake. We are asking for your help and ideas as we develop the general management plan. The public comment period for the Tule Lake Unit General Management Plan closed on October 11, 2013.  The NPS is reviewing all public comments received from 17 public meetings held in June-September 2013.  Meetings were held in: Tulelake, California Newell, California Klamath Falls, Oregon Portland, Oregon Hood River, Oregon Berkeley, California Carson, California Los Angeles, California San Diego, California San Francisco, California San Jose, California Auburn, Washington Seattle, Washington In Spring, 2014, the NPS will distribute a summary of public comments.      Your input is essential. As a new unit, there is no comprehensive plan for Tule Lake, and the National Park Service faces many issues and challenges for its future management. The most overarching issues are how to interpret what occurred at Tule Lake and how to ensure that visitors have meaningful experiences at Tule Lake tied to its history. In addition, planning will address the preservation of the unit's historic features and landscapes, its internal and adjacent boundaries, and how its areas could be developed for greater public access. Let us all join together in a spirit of cooperation and collaboration as we go forward! Click here for a PDF of the Newsletter      Join Our Email List",
