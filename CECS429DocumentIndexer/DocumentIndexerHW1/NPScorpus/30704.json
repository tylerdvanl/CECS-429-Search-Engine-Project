However if you are unable to make it to the island Park Rangers are delighted to present programs in your classroom in order to introduce students to a variety of subjects related to Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial. Topics can range from the War of 1812 to the Battle of Lake Erie to the National Park Service. Arrangements for a visit can be made by simply printing and filling out the (Request A Ranger) form and either faxing or mailing the form back to the park. This form can be used by schools and other organizations that would like to have a ranger come and give them a program. We will attempt to honor every request, however due to National Park Service priorities at Perry's Victory, staffing responsibilities, and previous commitments, not all requests may be possible. If you have any questions feel free to call the park at (419) 285-2184. Mailing address: P.O. Box 549 Put-In-Bay, OH 43456 Fax: (419) 285-5034",
