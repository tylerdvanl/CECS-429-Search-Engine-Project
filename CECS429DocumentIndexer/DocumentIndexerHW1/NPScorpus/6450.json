Hike over two miles of trails through sweeping tallgrass prairie and quiet bur oak woodland. The 100 acres of tallgrass prairie at Homestead National Monument of America has been restored to bring back the plants and animals that once covered the vast central plains of the United States. Explore this rare ecosystem and get a glimpse of what early homesteaders saw when they arrived on the prairie. Then escape from the beating sun and relentless prairie wind into the woods along Cub Creek, and feel the same relief as the homesteaders who found rare trees and water on the Great Plains.
