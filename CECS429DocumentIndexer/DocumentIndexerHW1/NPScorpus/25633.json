NPS \/ Jim Pfeiffenberger  The Seward Peninsula and Bering Land Bridge are much coveted areas for the serious birder. The varied topography results in 21 major avian habits where birds either live, migrate, winter, or breed. The proximity of the Seward Peninsula to Eurasia allows occasional accidentals to be spotted in this region. Opportunities to observe species in the crossroad of the Asiatic-North American flyway are found here and unlikely anywhere else in the continent. Additionally there are two major ecosystems: marine and the tundra. Combine all these elements and you have a haven of over 170 bird species!  A Word About The Birds The arctic tern travels the longest distance of all migrating birds.Traveling from the Arctic to the Antarctic and covering approximately 44,000 miles each year. With so much flying, the bird makes the equivalent of three round trips to the moon in a lifetime. One canâ€™t help but wonder what evolutionary path it took to make such as grand migration.  You may see the Sandhill Crane, which makes a trumpeting, rattling gar-oo-oo sound and is well-known for its mating ritual dance.  The horned lark, yellow warbler, and other small songbirds are heard before they are seen see, so practice your song identification. Sandpipers, loons, and plovers are among just a few of the shorebirds you will find along the Chukchi Sea coast. Ptarmigans are birds that live in the Arctic year-round and are the state bird of Alaska. They turn white in the winter and a reddish-brown in the fall. The yellow-billed loon only nest in the arctic region.",
