    "body": "Permits       Some activities require a Special Park Use Permit, for which there may be a fee. These include commercial filming\/video, still photography, certain kinds of gatherings, sale or distribution of printed matter, scattering of human ashes and any other special park uses that might interfere with normal visitor activities.  Special activities in the park must not cause injury or damage to park resources, be contrary to the purpose for which the park was established, unreasonably impair the atmosphere of peace and tranquility, interfere with interpretive visitor services or other programs, impair operation of public facilities, present clear or present danger, or cause significant conflict with other existing uses in the park. First Amendment demonstrations of less than 25 persons do not require a permit, but are limited to the park's designated First Amendment areas. A map of these ares is available upon request. Organizers of such gatherings may find it helpful to contact park staff to better assist in ensuring a successful event. Please contact the Law Enforcement Ranger office for further information on the permit process or for information on Special Park Use fees and exceptions: (217) 391-3256, or make a request in writing to the Superintendent. Please use the appropriate application form when making a request. There is a $50.00 non-refundable application fee required for most permit applications which you may be asked to provide at the time of application. Failure to attain a permit or violations of permit conditions may result in issuance of a federal violation notice (pursuant to 36 CFR 1.5(f) Closure and Public Use Limits, 36 CFR 1.6(g)(2) Permit Violation, and 54 USC 102701).",
