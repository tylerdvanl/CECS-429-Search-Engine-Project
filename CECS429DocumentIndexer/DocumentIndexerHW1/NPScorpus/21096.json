The National Park Service works cooperatively with scholars, site managers, and others to learn more about trail-related stories and sites. Since 2000, the agency has worked with more than 30 partners - the Trail of Tears Association, universities, museums, historical societies, and other nonprofit entities - on Trail of Tears projects. Many of these projects have brought forth new historical trail information. New trail segments have been identified, several buildings have been identified as being thematically related to the Trail of Tears migrations, several roadside interpretive waysides have been erected, and a number of new museum exhibits have been developed and are now on display.  Â   If you have an idea on a project that can add new historical information or challenge existing notions about the trail, contact the National Trails Intermountain Region staff.
