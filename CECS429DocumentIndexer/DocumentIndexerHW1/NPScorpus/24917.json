This flow occurred with the top layer of lava cooling as the bottom layer continued moving. The movement of the flowing bottom layer created waves in the hardening top layer. When the lava cooled and turned to rock, the waves become wrinkles in the lava. The smooth wavy texture of the Lost Jim Lava Flow contrasts the broken look of the surrounding Imuruk Lava field which has experienced thousands of years of weathering.",
