Here at Bandelier, rabbits, deer, piñon nuts, and wild grass seeds played a major role in Archaic people’s survival. The use of pottery would not have been practical for these nomadic people. Hand-woven yucca and willow baskets were probably used for gathering and storing plants, nuts and other wild foods. Around 1150, the Ancestral Pueblo people began to move into this area from other locations.",
