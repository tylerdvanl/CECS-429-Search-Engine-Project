Our partners have included California Lutheran University, California State Parks, Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, NASA, Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, NatureBridge, and University of California. Topics covered in our workshops vary from year to year. Recent professional development workshops have focused on climate change, phenology, invasive species, mountain lion research, and ways to engage students on a self-guided field trip to the Santa Monica Mountains.    Current \/ Future Workshops We do not have any workshops scheduled at this time.

This course introduced teachers to the science of phenology - the study of the seasonal cycles in plants and animals and how it's used to track the effects of climate change on wild plants and animals (among many other uses such as tracking allergens and predicting wildfires). Teachers learned ways to convey to students the basics of climate change, plant growth and reproduction, plant-­‐animal interactions, and the responses of plants to climate change. Teachers developed, reviewed and tested phenology-themed lesson plans and outdoor activities and customized them for their own use. Teachers learned about the two statewide and national education and research organizations: The California Phenology Project, and the USA National Phenology Network. Teachers contributed data collected by their students to the only nationwide Database that's detecting the effects of climate change on the seasonal rhythms of plants and animals. Materials for this workshop will be available online soon.    Examples of Previous Workshops Interested in learning about what kind of workshops we had in the past?
