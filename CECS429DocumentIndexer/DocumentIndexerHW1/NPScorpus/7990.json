His heirs left the land to the Parkway as a memorial to the man who shared the natural beauty of the area with others. Visitors will find ample opportunities to explore the mountains with camping, picnicking, and canoeing and fishing on Price Lake. The Parkway's popular Tanawha Trail crosses here and rises along the ecologically fragile slopes of Grandfather Mountain. With its wilderness appeal of forested highlands and cold mountain streams, Price Park is a haven for relaxation and recreation.       What to Do  Rent a boat or canoe to glide through natural beauty or try your luck at fishing at Price Lake Picnic and take your choice of more than 100 picnic sites Camp under the stars at the Parkway’s largest campground Enjoy seasonal interpretive programs at a 300-seat amphitheater, guided walks and evening campfire programs Visit the Parkway’s official craft center at Flat Top Manor at the Moses Cone estate and watch mountain handicraft demonstrations Explore a family cemetery, carriage and apple barn, and an extensive system of carriage trails for a unique Parkway visit Enjoy ample nature walks and hiking trails throughout the parks Attend the nation’s largest annual National Lumberjack Association rally          For boat rental information call 828-963-2292 or visit http:\/\/pricelakeboatrentals.wix.com\/blueridgeparkway",
