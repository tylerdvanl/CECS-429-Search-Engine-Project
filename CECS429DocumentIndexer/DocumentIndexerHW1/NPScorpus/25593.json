Human Hundred Challenge              Human Hundred: A Centennial Challenge        NPS Photos by Kent Miller, Charlotte Bodak, Alex Van Der Styuf, and Jay Elhard         The sticker for participants who complete the Human Hundred Challenge in 2016.   Grab your gear. Mark your map. Start your app, if that's your thing. Walk, bike, run, ski, snowshoe - however you feel moved to move yourself!   The Challenge The \"Human Hundred\" challenges you to log 100 miles using human power in Denali during the NPS and Denali centennial celebrations. This means you have 2016 and 2017 to complete the challenge, though you can aim for 100 miles each year if you wish. In addition to spending time in your park, successful challengers even get a prize - a commemorative sticker (which will be different in 2016 and 2017).  You can complete the challenge any way you wish. There will be a number of hosted\/group events, which will be advertised on this page as they are scheduled - or, you can log all of your miles on your own. Regularly scheduled ranger programs are also a great way to accrue miles!    Instructions  Track your miles. You can use your own method, or you can download and use our simple log.  For biking, please divide your total miles by 3 and use that number, to account for mechanical advantage. For activities best counted as \"hours\" (e.g., yoga, dance, etc), 1 hour = 1 mile (or use your best judgment!) Once you're done: Visit the Denali Visitor Center, Eielson Visitor Center, the Walter Harper Ranger Station in Talkeetna or the Backcountry Information Center to report that you've completed the challenge. You can also email Molly McKinley, the coordinator of the Human Hundred Challenge.  Don't forget to share your #denali100 experience with your friends and family on social media!     Sample Tracking Sheet   You should keep track of your mileage (and\/or hours) however you'd like.
