Christmas Bird Count Each year, citizen scientists make an enormous contribution to conservation by braving the cold weather to take part in the Christmas Bird Count. Hot Springs National Park, along with the local chapters of the National Audubon Society and the City of Hot Springs, collects this data to assess the bird populations and to help guide conservation actions. From December 14 through January 5, all around the country families, students, birders and scientists - armed with binoculars, bird guides, and checklists - go out on an annual mission, often before dawn. For over one hundred years, the desire to both make a difference and to experience the beauty of nature has driven dedicated people to leave the comfort of a warm house during the Holiday season.
