These small creatures live at depths of about 300 ft. to 3,000 ft. (the deepest water in the park is about 12 feet). However, after they die, the small bouyancy chambers they use for adjusting their depth in the water often wash up onto our beaches. They look very much like miniature ram's horns and thus give the squid its name. One is shown in the bottom right of the photo at the top of this page.
