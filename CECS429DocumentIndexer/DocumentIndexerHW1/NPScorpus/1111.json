The goal is to begin restoring the natural range of variability in the elk population and affected plant communities. The plan relies on a variety of conservation tools including temporary fencing, vegetation restoration, redistribution and culling. The park may use additional management tools in the future using adaptive management principles. Current Conditions The elk population is currently at or below the winter population objective of 600-800 animals using the winter range in the park. A report on vegetation conditions for the first adaptive management review will be released in 2015.            Plan Development           Implementation - Elk Population           Implementation - Vegetation             Human Dimensions           Adaptive Management",
