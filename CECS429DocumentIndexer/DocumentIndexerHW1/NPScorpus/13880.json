The project team worked closely with the National Center for Accessibility to achieve a fully accessible experience. All new interactive and tactile exhibits offer visitors a greater chance to find their connection to the President's House. Fore example, visitors will be able to touch tactile maps, pieces of stone used to construct the White House, and replicas of significant objects like the North Portico door knob . Visitors with vision or hearing impairments may request equipment at the information desk to experience the comprehensive audio tour for the museum's exhibits and interactive elements (all film and audio components are open-captioned).              Ellipse Visitor Pavilion Complex  Located just west of the corner of 15th and E Streets, NW Open daily from 7:30 am to 4 pm Closed on Thanksgiving Day, December 25, and Janurary 1  The Ellipse Visitor Pavilion has a concessions stand, accessible restrooms, water fountains, and an information desk.
