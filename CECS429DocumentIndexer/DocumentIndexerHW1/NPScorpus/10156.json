    "body": "Laws & Policies       Superintendent's Compendium The Superintendent's Compendium is a collection the relevant rules and regulations for the park. View or download the complete 2014 Superintendent's Compendium [PDF, 176k]. The Superintendent's Compendium addresses park-specific issues using Federal authority granted to the superintendent in Title 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 1 through 7. The CFR is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. Under 36 CFR 1.7(b), \"the superintendent shall compile in writing all the designations, closures, permit requirements and other restrictions imposed under discretionary authority. This compilation shall be updated annually and made available to the public upon request.\" The larger body of NPS regulations that do not provide discretionary authority to the Superintendent is not cited in this compendium. A complete and accurate picture of regulations governing use and protection of the unit can only be gained by viewing this compendium in context with the full body of applicable regulations found in Titles 36 and 43 CFR. The use of unmanned aerial devices, also known as drones, is prohibited within the boundaries of Salem Maritime National Historic Site. Firearms in National Parks The law governing possession of firearms inside a national park changed on February 22, 2010. Visitors may possess firearms within a national park unit provided they comply with federal, state, and local laws. The role of the responsible gun owner is to know and obey the federal, state, and local laws appropriate to the park they are visiting.  Please remember that federal law prohibits firearms in certain park facilities and buildings. These places are marked with signs at public entrances.
