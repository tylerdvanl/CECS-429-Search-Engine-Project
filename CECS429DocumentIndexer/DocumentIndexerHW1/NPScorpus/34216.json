    "body": "2010 floods       The March 2010 flood was a result of snowmelt combined with rain. This flood was high enough to cover the clifftops in several places, but it did not flood the overlooks or reach the High Water Marks pole at Overlook 3.  Floods are a vital part of the ecosystem. They provide nutrient rich soil and sediment for the clifftop areas, home to a truly unique variety of plant life, in Great Falls Park. These areas would not be as diverse as they are without flooding. While the trash will be cleaned up, logs and other natural debris are left to decay, returning and adding nutrients to the soil.
