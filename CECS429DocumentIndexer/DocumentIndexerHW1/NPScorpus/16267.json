    "body": "Fumaroles        Fumaroles or steam vents are the hottest hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. NPS \/ Jim Peaco       A fumarole, also called a steam vent, occurs when a hydrothermal feature has so little water in its system that the water boils away before reaching the surface. Steam and other gases emerge from the feature's vent, sometimes hissing or whistling. Steam vents are often superheated, with temperatures as high as 280°F (138°C).  Black Growler Steam Vent: Located in Norris Geyser Basin, Black Growler is one of Yellowstone's most famous steam vents. This feature has a history of shifting its location several times. It has been active since 1878 at least, often roaring in a noisy stream of hot vapor.       More Information  Norris Geyser Basin Tour Inside Yellowstone Videos about Hydrothermal Features: Watch videos that tell the story of microorganisms that thrive in hot water.
