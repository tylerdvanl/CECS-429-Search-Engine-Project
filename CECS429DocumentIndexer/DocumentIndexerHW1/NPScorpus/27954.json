Volunteers should meet at Rock Creek Campground at 10:00 am (ET). Trail maintenance will be performed on the 2.5-mile section of the Cumberland Trail between Rock Creek Campground and Alley Ford. This section was adopted by TCWP in 1998. After completing the trail work, participants will enjoy a late lunch by the river before hiking back to the campground. Work will concentrate on routine trail maintenance such as cleaning out clogged water bars, removing down logs and limbs, cutting back brush along the trail and establishing the original trail base in some areas.Â  The event is expected to conclude around 3:00 pm. Participants should wear sturdy shoes or boots and bring work gloves, shovels, loppers, clippers, and small bow saws or folding saws (NO CHAINSAWS). Some hand tools will be available at the event. Volunteers should bring clothing appropriate for weather conditions, and plenty of water, snacks, and a lunch. Also sunscreen and bug spray may be needed. In the event of bad weather, this work day will be rescheduled for February 27.
