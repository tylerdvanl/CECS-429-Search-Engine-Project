    "body": "Water Activities       Swimming Besides the outdoor pools available to the public during summer at Half Dome Village (formerly Curry Village) and Yosemite Valley Lodge (formerly Yosemite Lodge), swimming is generally permitted in all bodies of water in the park. There are some exceptions, however, where swimming is prohibited:  Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, and within one mile upstream along any tributary (e.g., Rancheria Falls). Dana Fork of the Tuolumne River Emerald Pool and Silver Apron (above Vernal Fall) Lake Eleanor Reservoir (when posted) Wawona Domestic Water Intake (and 100 yards upstream)  Swimming in the Merced River is a popular way to cool off--but help protect the river by entering and exiting only on sandy beaches. Swimming in rivers is not without hazards, including swift currents, cold water, and hazards within the river (e.g., trees). See Water Safety for more information.      Boating and Rafting  Rafting along the Merced River is popular during summer. You can rent a raft (typically in June and July, but it varies from year to year, depending on water level) or bring your own. (Other nonmotorized vessels, such as kayaks, are also permitted.) Most people put in along the Merced River at Stoneman Bridge (near Half Dome Village, formerly Curry Village) and take out at Sentinel Beach Picnic Area. You may not take out your raft between Stoneman Bridge and Sentinel Beach and you must have a personal flotation device immediately available for each occupant of the raft (and children under age 13 must be wearing one). This section of river is open to boating and rafting each day when the gage height at Pohono Bridge is below 7 feet at 8 am.  Rafting is also allowed on the South Fork of the Merced River below Swinging Bridge (in Wawona). Kayaking is a popular way to enjoy the calm waters of Tenaya Lake. More experienced boaters with appropriate equipment have additional opportunities along the Merced and Tuolumne Rivers.        Fishing Regulations  Fishing regulations for Yosemite National Park follow those set by the state of California, including the requirement that people 16 or older have a valid California fishing license. The season for stream and river fishing begins on the last Saturday in April and continues through November 15. All lakes and reservoirs are open to fishing year-round.
