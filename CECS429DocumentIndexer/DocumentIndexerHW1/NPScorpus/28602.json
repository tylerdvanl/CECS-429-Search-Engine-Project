The Johnstown Flood National Memorial is located in South Fork, Cambria County, PA at the site of the South Fork Dam. After years of mistreatment, abuse, and lack of care, the South Fork Dam, owned at the time by the South Fork Fishing & Hunting Club, failed on Friday, May 31, 1889 sending a wall of water through the Conemaugh Valley and ultimately destroyed Johnstown. A visit to the Johnstown Flood National Memorial allows the visitor to take in the scope and size of the disaster, to see the ruins of the South Fork Dam, and to formulate their own conclusions as to what exactly was responsible for the destruction of the South Fork Dam.
