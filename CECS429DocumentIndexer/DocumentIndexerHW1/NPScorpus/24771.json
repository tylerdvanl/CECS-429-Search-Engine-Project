Glacier Bay is a remote location and is accessible only by boat or small plane. We do have a very active volunteer program and it is normally based on project needs, and funded through park divisions separately. It is this park's preference to review applications on hand for volunteer selections on park projects. Please use the following link to download\/print an official volunteer application. Volunteer Application PDF format 60K Once you have completed the application, you can send it to this address:  Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve ATTN: Steve Schaller Volunteer Coordinator PO Box 140, Gustavus AK 99826  We look forward to hearing from you.
