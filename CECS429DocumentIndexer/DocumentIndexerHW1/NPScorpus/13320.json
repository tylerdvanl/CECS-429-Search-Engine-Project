Motorized equipment is prohibited.    No Camping Zones Camping in the Half Dome and Little Yosemite Valley area is permitted only in the Little Yosemite Valley Campground. Camping is not permitted between Yosemite Valley and Little Yosemite Valley. If you would like to camp in a dispersed Wilderness setting, you must be at least two miles beyond the Little Yosemite Valley campground (at or beyond Moraine Dome or beyond the Half Dome\/John Muir Trail junction). Camping is not permitted on top of Half Dome or at Lost Lake. Camping is permitted at backpackers' campgrounds near Glen Aulin, May Lake, Sunrise, Merced Lake, and Vogelsang High Sierra Camps. Each campground contains food lockers and group fire rings (fires are not permitted at Vogelsang). When the High Sierra Camps are open, composting toilets and potable water are also available. All other camping should be away from each HSC. You must camp at least four trail miles from Tuolumne Meadows, Yosemite Valley, Glacier Point, Hetch Hetchy, and Wawona, and at least one air mile from any road. The trailheads map (1.5 mb PDF) shows minimum legal camping distances for each trail (beyond the arrows). Camping is also not permitted in the:  Parker Pass Creek watershed Dana Fork of the Tuolumne River watershed Gaylor Creek watershed Lukens Lake Budd Creek watershed The top of Half Dome Within 100 feet of a trail, flowing stream, river or any body of water, unless designated,and as follows: Camping is permitted within 100 feet of a stream, trail or body of water provided that a well established campsite exists and terrain permits no other options. In no case will camping be permitted within 25 feet of a stream, trail or body of water. Below the high water line at both Lake Eleanor and Hetch Hetchy    Frequently Asked Questions  Do I have to camp in designated campsites? No, in the vast majority of the park. Only at the five High Sierra Camps and in the Little Yosemite Valley area must you camp at a designated site. Otherwise you may camp anywhere you like, provided you follow all the regulations listed above.   Can I use a Sierra stove above 9,600 feet? No, you may not use a Sierra stove (stick stove) above 9,600 feet in elevation. The small twigs used to fuel Sierra stoves are just as valuable a part of the ecosystem as is the larger wood used in traditional campfires. Regrowth at higher elevations is extremely slow and the soil is low in nutrients. Removing this wood from the system further slows growth.
