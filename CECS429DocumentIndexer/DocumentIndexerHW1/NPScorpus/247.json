All three areas are adjacent to the North Platte River on the Monument's north boundary. These three areas consist of approximately 27 acres and are identified as marsh. The plants are classified as emergent in two areas and scrub-shrub in the third. The areas can be seasonally flooded in the spring as the river rises from melted snow in the Rocky Mountains and temporarily flooded at other times of the year due to rainfall events upstream.",
