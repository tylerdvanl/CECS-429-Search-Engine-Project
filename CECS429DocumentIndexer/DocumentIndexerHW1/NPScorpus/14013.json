Under the right conditions, a controlled burn is utilized to \"clean up\" the forest floor and promote re-growth. It may also be used to protect the public, adjacent communities, infrastructures, as well as cultural and natural resources. Controlled burning usually occurs in the early Spring and late Fall in our Park.    One way that fire is managed is through monitoring weather conditions.
