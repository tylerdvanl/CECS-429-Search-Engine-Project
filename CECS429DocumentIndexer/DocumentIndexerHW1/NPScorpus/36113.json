This is a solo exhibition of a selection of pieces related thematically to the Mexican Revolution, La Revolución. Carlos studied at La Academia de San Carlos in Mexico City, Mexico. He studied under Alfaro Siqueiros, one of Mexico's greatest muralists. The mural on the outside walls of the Memorial's administrative offices, Nuestra Herencia, was first painted by Carlos in 1994. With the assistance of his son Marcos, he has recently finished a complete restoration of the mural with a few changes. Carlos also has an indoor mural displayed in the Lincoln Center in Washington D.C.   \"[The Mexican revolution] was a break with the past to recover the past. We were trying to deny we had an Indian and a black and a Spanish past. The Mexican revolution accepted all heritages. It allowed Mexico to be mestizo.\" (Carlos Fuentes, Mexican author)     Find out when you can view this exhibit.",
