    "body": "Swimming        Always swim at a lifeguarded beach. During the summer season, well-trained staff at Sailors Haven and Watch Hill beaches provide a watchful eye over ocean swimmers.        During the summer, Fire Island National Seashore provides opportunities for supervised swimming at two lifeguarded ocean beaches, Sailors Haven and at Watch Hill, which are both accessible by ferry or private boat. NPS lifeguarded beaches are normally staffed daily from late June through Labor Day weekend. Additional weekend days may be added before and after the summer season if staffing and weather conditions permit. The Town of Brookhaven operates a public beach at Davis Park, accessible by ferry from Sandspit Park in Patchogue (Davis Park Ferry), and the Town of Islip provides lifeguards on Fire Island at Atlantique Beach, accessible by ferry from Bay Shore (Fire Island Ferries). Few Fire Island communities have public facilities for swimming, since most beach users are staying in private homes or other accommodations. Smith Point County Park and Robert Moses State Park offer lifeguarded beaches accessible by car. Both have large capacity parking lots (fee charged), changing rooms and showers, snack bars, picnic tables and a small playground for children.         For Your Safety  Be sure to avoid overexposure to the sun. Always use caution in or around the water. Never swim alone. Learn to recognize rip currents: See NOAA's Break the Grip of the Rip® educational materials",
