Junior Ranger workbooks are available free of charge for children up to 14 years of age at the Visitor Center! By completing the activities in the book and reciting the Junior Ranger Pledge, kids are awarded a special badge that identifies them as official Junior Rangers for both Montezuma Castle and Tuzigoot National Monuments. Be sure to ask a park ranger at the Montezuma Castle and Montezuma Well visitor centers for further details on the program and to receive your free booklet. A national online Junior Ranger program, called Web Rangers, is available to people of any age at www.nps.gov\/webrangers\/",
