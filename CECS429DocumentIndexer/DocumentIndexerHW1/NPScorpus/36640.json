It has numerous yellow flowers, each with four petals arranged in a basal rosette. The leaves are arranged around the stem in an alternating pattern. Plant Lore: The Western Wallflower has the greatest range of distribution by elevation of any wildflower in Utah. It has been documented to live everywhere between 2,500 ft and 12,500 ft. (800-4000m). This flower offers little practical use beyond being a pleasing ornamental. Wallflowers obtained their unusual name as they commonly grow along old walls in Europe.
