    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Things To Do             Things To Do       Activities Wonderful recreational opportunities abound. We have a world-class velodrome, host to bicycle racing Olympic tryouts (and soon to host an international racing championship.) Skiing is popular in our region and many of the Pocono Mountain resorts offer special packages. Whitewater rafting and canoeing in still waters both draw attention to the spectacular scenery. Festivals celebrating music and the arts draw thousands of visitors to the center of the Corridor: Mayfair in Allentown, Pennsylvania, offers three stages of music and dance, over 30 ethnic food booths and over 100 juried craftspeople during Memorial Day Weekend; Musikfest in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, offers nine stages of music, over 100 ethnic food booths and a stage dedicated to children's cultural events the second week in August. Other wonderful festivals celebrating the diversity of the region are offered as well. The local tourist promotion agencies offer up-to-date information on the variety and locations of these celebrations. Under development is a 160-mile long trail that will intersect with the Appalachian Trail and over twenty others. Currently, you can hike between Catasauqua and Bristol, Pennsylvania on a restored towpath following the Lehigh Navigation System and the Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal System. The trail follows beside the Lehigh and Delaware Rivers, passing through bucolic countryside and teeming municipalities.",
