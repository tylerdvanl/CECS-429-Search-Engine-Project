Park Description: The solitude and open spaces of the Niobrara River Valley represent a multi-generational mixing and evolution of life forms and life-styles, from millions of years ago to the present. Artists may find this landscape and the park museum collections inspiring for their work, and discover new ways to convey the mysteries of deep time and this special corner of the globe to the public. The park will celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2015 and hopefully the medium of art can contribute to those festivities. Program Description: Artists of all mediums (visual, musical, theatrical, literary) are invited to apply to stay from two to four weeks in furnished park housing (a modern 3 bedroom, possibly shared house). Artists provide their own materials and expenses and produce, at least, one product (along with its copyright) to be donated to the park for any and all future uses. Artists will also actively engage the public in some manner (occasional demonstrations, talks, school programs, or exhibits) during and possibly after their visit. How to Apply: Contact the park (tel. 308-668-2211, or 308-436-9760); email: e-mail us) and be ready to share your statement of purpose and portfolio. Artists will be enrolled as park volunteers, which provides worker's compensation insurance. The artist should be self-sufficient and ready to work closely with park staff and the local community.        Cultural demonstrator Carol Snow (Seneca) working at Agate Fossil Beds.   Other Information: Artists with American Indian heritage are also welcome to apply for a related cultural demonstrator program. These artists set up shop in the visitor center on long summer weekends (Friday – Sunday), share their stories, demonstrate, and sell their wares to the public. Shared park housing and some reimbursement for expenses may be available.       Pastel painting by Mary Louise Tejeda Brown of the Niobrara River Valley at Agate Fossil Beds National Monument.",
