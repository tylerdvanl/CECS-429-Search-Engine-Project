By comparison, his single story birthplace cottage measured only 14 feet by 20 feet in size. Although you can go inside the house where America’s 31st President was born, the homes on Downey and Poplar streets are not open to the public and are used as offices or residences.        Historic homes along Downey Street contribute to the neighborhood-like setting around Herbert Hoover's birthplace.

Those homes, and others, were neighbors to the Hoovers in their second home, \"House of the Maples,\" which no longer stands. Later additions to the neighborhood included the Leech and C.E. Smith houses, both part of the historic site today.             Historic Homes on Downey Street     West Branch boomed between 1869 and 1873.
