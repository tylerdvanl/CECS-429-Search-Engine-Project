Through Expedition Yellowstone the National Park Service offers a 4-5 day curriculum-based residential program for teachers and their 4-8th grade classes. This long-standing program operates September through mid December and mid February through May. The program has two campuses. The historic Lamar Buffalo Ranch is used during the spring and fall. The Youth Conservation Corps facilities are used during winter months. Expedition Yellowstone teaches students about the natural and cultural history of Yellowstone National Park, investigates current issues affecting the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, and promotes stewardship and preservation in the park and in home communities. Emphasis is on learning through direct experience in the outdoors. Students participate with teachers and parent chaperones in hikes, field investigations, discussions, creative dramatics, and journal writing. The program coordinator works with teachers to tailor an itinerary for the group that best meets their educational needs. Expedition Yellowstone operates on a fee basis to cover faculty salaries and instructional supplies used by students. A staff of rangers with diverse education backgrounds instruct these expeditions to the park. Teachers, if you'd like more information, please contact the Youth Programs Office.
