In the Olmsted Firm, the process of designing a landscape was often long and involved many people. Typically, the design process included the following steps:  Prospective clients sent written inquiries to the Olmsted Firm proposing a potential project. Members of the firm conducted surveys and studies on a preliminary site visit. The landscape architect's initial ideas and designs would be presented in preliminary plans, which were drafted with reference to topographical maps and studies of the site.  After a client had approved a preliminary plan, a draftsman would draw a general plan of the landscape.  Architectural and engineering drawings showed plans for structures, bridges, and other built features of the landscape design. Planting plans showed the specific locations of individual plants and trees. The firm often built three-dimensional models to illustrate their designs. The client contracted the construction of the landscape through a bidding-process. Though the Olmsted Firm did not build their designs, a member of the firm was usually on-site throughout the construction of a landscape. Representatives of the firm paid follow-up visits to completed projects to ensure the success of a project.  How did this process work in a real-life park design?
