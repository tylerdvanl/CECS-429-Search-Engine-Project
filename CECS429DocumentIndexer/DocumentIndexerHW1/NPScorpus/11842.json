    "body": "SMMNRA Interagency Trail Management Plan       PLANNING RESTART!National Park Service, California State Parks, Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, and the Mountains Recreation & Conservation Authority are reinitiating preparation of the long-awaited Trail Management Plan (TMP).  The TMP will establish the overall vision for future development and management of the SMMNRA trail network.  Based on identified desired conditions for park natural, cultural and recreational resources, the TMP will prescribe a comprehensive plan for circulation, access, and allowable trail uses for trails throughout the national recreation area. A NEPA and CEQA-based Environmental Impact Statement\/Environmental Impact Report (EIS\/EIR) will accompany the TMP to provide a detailed analysis of potential environmental impacts of the proposed plan. The original federal and state notices to prepare the TMP EIS\/EIR were published in 2003.  In September 2005, NPS, State Parks, and SMMC\/MRCA conducted public scoping meetings and gathered public comments on conceptual trail policies and map alternatives needed to prepare the Draft EIS\/EIR.  Owing to lack of funding, the NPS and partner agencies were unable to continue preparation of the EIS\/EIR after the 2005 public scoping effort.  With funding now in hand, the partner agencies are reinitiating preparation of the joined TMP EIS\/EIR. We invite your participation throughout the coming planning process.  Â    PUBLIC SCOPING WRAP-UP  Click here to jump to the 2014 Public Scoping information.  Public scoping is the earliest phase of preparing a proposed plan or project. The public's input is gathered to help formulate the plan and identify potential environmental impacts that should be analyzed before a plan is finalized.  A trail management plan has not yet been developed, although concepts for the content of a plan have been conceived and are included in the 2005 Public Scoping and 2014 Public Scoping information. The public's input is welcome on these draft concepts.  The public may also offer other concepts, suggest issues to consider, and suggest ideas for a range of trail management plan alternatives. The first step toward preparing the TMP is to complete the public scoping for EIS\/EIR that was initiated in 2005.  Federal and state notices to prepare the TMP EIS\/EIR have been newly released and announce the opportunity for the public to give input on the content and alternatives of the EIS\/EIR.
