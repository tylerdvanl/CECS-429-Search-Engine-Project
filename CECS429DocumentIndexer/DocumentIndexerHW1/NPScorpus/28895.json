Be a good park visitor. Take nothing but photographs, leave nothing but footprints. Enjoy yourself and remember future visitors who will come after you hoping to enjoy these American treasures too. Support stewardship of the memorial by supporting the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum and by becoming educated about the park's natural and cultural resources. Be a volunteer. There's nothing more rewarding than warm thanks from visitors who you helped connect to the park and it's resources!",
