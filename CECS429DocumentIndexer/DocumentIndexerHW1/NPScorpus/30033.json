    "body": "Fishing              Surf-fishing is an activity you can enjoy throughout the year on Fire Island. When ferry service is limited or the boating season is over, you may still drive to either end of the island for access to the beach.  A no-fee New York State recreational marine fishing registry is now required, and New York State recreational saltwater fishing seasons, size and possession limits apply. Commercial fishing is not allowed within the boundaries of Fire Island National Seashore. New York State Department of Environmental Conservation maintains two artificial fishing reefs in the Great South Bay, and several in the Atlantic Ocean south of Fire Island. Nearby Captree State Park-on the eastern end of Jones Beach Island and north of the Fire Island Inlet-offers access to several charter fishing boats. Boat ramps for private vessels are also available at Captree and several other nearby state parks, and at Smith Point County Marina. Fishing is not permitted in Fire Island National Seashore's marinas, nor at designated lifeguarded swimming beaches. Unauthorized vessels are not permitted within 300 feet of the Fire Island Lighthouse Pier.      Notice to Visitors: The harvest of horseshoe crabs is prohibited within Fire Island National Seashore.   Sportsman's Recreational Vehicle Permits are sold in the fall when beach conditions permit, as a means of access for fishing or hunting. Stringent restrictions apply.",
