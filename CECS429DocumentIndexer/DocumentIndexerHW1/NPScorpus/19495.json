General information may be found online at http:\/\/www.agfc.com\/fishing\/Pages\/default.aspx The current fishing guidebook is available online at http:\/\/www.agfc.com\/resources\/Pages\/ResourcesPublicationsGuidebookFishing.aspx and at park visitor and information centers.    Â    Fly Fishing When most people think of fly fishing, they think of a small, cold stream full of trout. On your stay at Buffalo National River, don't forget your fly rod because if you have never felt the pull of a smallmouth bass on the end of your fly line, you are missing out! Warm water fly fishing is an exciting challenge for any angler. There are many species of fish in the Buffalo that just love to hit a fly. Early in the morning or late in the afternoon, break out your popper bugs or any other top water fly and hang on for the explosion! Hand sized pan fish, goggle eye and smallmouth bass all crash the surface for a tasty bug treat. Try your luck with a bead head woolly worm or crawfish fly near the big rocks along the banks and you could lure out a nice size smallmouth. Whether you are a dry or wet fly fisherman, pack your rod and enjoy the fishing opportunities available here on the Buffalo National River.",
