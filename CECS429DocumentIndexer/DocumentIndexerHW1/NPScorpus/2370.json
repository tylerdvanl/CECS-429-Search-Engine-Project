NPS Robb Hannawacker       Scientific Name   Red-Spotted Toad: Anaxyrus punctatus  Identification   Small amphibians, red-spotted toads grow up to 3 inches (7.6cm) long. Small red dots cover their tan or grey bodies.They have pale undersides. Large, round glands protrude from the back side of the head.There is one gland behind each eye, and each gland is approximately the size of an eye. The most common call is a high pitched trill, made by males, and lasting 4-10 seconds. Tadpoles are black or dark brown, with metallic bronze flecks.They grow up to 1.5 inches (3.8cm).  Habitat   Red-spotted toads are found in almost all of Arizona, except for high mountains and the Yuma Desert. In the Grand Canyon, red-spotted toads are found near permanent streams in side canyons, and along the Colorado River. They prefer rocky areas, and use crevices in the rocks for shelter.  Behavior   Adult red-spotted toads are carnivores that feed primarily on insects, including ants, bees, and beetles.They occasionally feed on smaller amphibians. They often spend the day in rock crevices, and become active at dusk, for feeding and mating. Breeding season is from March-June.During this time, males will engage in wrestling matches to establish territory. Females lay individual eggs (rather than laying eggs in clumps like most amphibians in the Grand Canyon). After hatching, tadpoles metamorphose into adults in 6-8 weeks. Red-spotted toads are very well adapted to life in an arid environment. They can survive a 40% loss of body water            More Information Red-Spotted Toad by Reptiles of AZ Desert USA",
