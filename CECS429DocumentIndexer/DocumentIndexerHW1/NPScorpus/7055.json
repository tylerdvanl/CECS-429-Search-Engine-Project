    "body": "Cross-country Skiing and Snowshoeing       \"All life in the wilderness is so pleasant...a trip on snow-shoes through the silent, mysterious fairy-land of the woods in winter...\"                        Theodore Roosevelt  Â    CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING & SNOWSHOEING The Little Missouri Badlands receives about 30 inches of snow a year. Snow can arrive in October and stay until April. The wind tends to blow the snow around quite a bit, leaving some areas bare and others drifted high. The park does not groom any trails for cross-country skiing. Skiers blaze their own trails through the snow. The best places to cross-country ski are on the frozen Little Missouri River and on closed park roads. Skiing on park trails can be somewhat difficult. The trails are narrow and many cross creek bottoms. These creek bottoms are like little canyons and may be too steep for safe skiing. They, and all coulees and draws, may also fill up with blowing snow hiding their true depth. Also be aware of wildlife and keep a safe distance from bison (100 yards minimum).
