The Reach is a term used to describe a section of the river. The reach you select will be defined by your put-in and take-out locations. Each reach has its own beauty and challenges.  A chart of the mileage between river accesses may be found here.  Remember that river travel is not strictly a miles-per-hour undertaking since different reaches have different flows and impediments.",
