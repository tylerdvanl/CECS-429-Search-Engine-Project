Julian Alden Weir, a leading figure in American art and the development of American Impressionism, acquired the farm in 1882. After Weir, the artistic legacy was continued by his daughter, painter Dorothy Weir Young and her husband, sculptor Mahonri Young, followed by New England painters Sperry and Doris Andrews. Today, with sixteen historic buildings and 60-acres of beautiful cultural landscape, these resources combine to tell the story of artists living and being inspired by the landscape at Weir Farm National Historic Site for more than 130 years and are one of the nation's finest remaining landscapes of American art. The stories of past inhabitants and the breathtaking landscape continue to inspire contemporary artists, all of whom comprise the next generation of artists here at Weir Farm National Historic Site.",
