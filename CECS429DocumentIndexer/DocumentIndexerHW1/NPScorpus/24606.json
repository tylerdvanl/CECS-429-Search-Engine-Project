Scientists in the park study up to eight new locations each year, as part of an on-going study to document the natural, non-human sounds of Denali, and assess the incursion of human-caused sounds.  Recordings from remote sound stations offer an audio window on the secret lives of animals and natural features in Denali. Available below are a number of sound clips taken from these sound stations to use as ring tones on your phone. We hope they remind you of memories you formed during a visit, or hint at the audio beauty of the park, if you've not yet visited.
