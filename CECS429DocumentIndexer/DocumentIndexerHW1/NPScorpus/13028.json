In recent projects, warm season grass species have been used including Little Blue Stem, Red Top, Indian Grass and Switch Grass.Grasses are important for many reasons. Areas that have been cleared of vegetation are highly susceptible to erosion and invasion by exotic and invasive plant species. When grasses are present, they serve as a cover, holding the soil in place to prevent erosion and deterring undesirable plants. They also provide great habitat for wildlife nesting. Warm season grasses are aesthetically pleasing and since many species are native to the area, they are very valuable in maintenance and restoration projects.",
