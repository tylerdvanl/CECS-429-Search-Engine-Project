    "body": "General Management Plan       The planning process to update the General Management Plan for Pipestone National Monument began in September 2000. Public involvement throughout the process has been critical in helping the planning team identify issues and concerns to be addressed, develop a set of preliminary alternatives, and select a preferred alternative. Issues of concern addressed in the plan include sensitivity to and interpretation of American Indian practices and traditions associated with the quarries and sacred sites, inadequate facilities, and the preservation of the cultural and natural resources. The final approved plan establishes a direction for the future of the monument that will support American Indian cultural use, manage cultural and natural resources, and provide for visitor experiences in such a way that future opportunities and issues can be addressed effectively.
