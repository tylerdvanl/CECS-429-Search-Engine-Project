All campgrounds have modern restrooms, potable water, unheated showers, grills and tables. Check-out time is noon. No more than two vehicles (pop-up camper is considered a vehicle) and six persons may occupy a single site. Parking space for extra vehicles is severely limited, so plan accordingly. If you must bring more than two vehicles, make arrangements to park your extra vehicle outside the park or purchase an additional campsite. From Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend, camping is limited to a total of 14 days within a 30-day period. The campgrounds are located on the ocean side separated from the beach by barrier dunes. Frisco Campground is located among sand dunes. All others are on level ground. Soil at all the campgrounds is sandy; therefore, longer than normal tent stakes are recommended. There are no shade trees. Mosquitoes may be a problem, so netting and insect repellent are recommended.     Reservations Reservations for all are recommended and can be made through Recreation.gov or calling 1-877-444-6777 for dates within the period indicated above, up to six months in advance. Reservations must be made at least three days in advance. Campsites can also be sold on-site when sites are not fully reserved.   Group Camping Camping for groups of 7–30 people is available only at Oregon Inlet Campground. These sites must be reserved at least two weeks in advance through Recreation.gov or calling 1-877-444-6777, and can be reserved up to twelve months in advance. Group camping is $70 per night, including infants and toddlers, and passes do NOT apply.   Discounts Holders of the National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Senior or Access Pass, or the Golden Age or Access pass are eligible for a 50% discount on their campsite. If making a reservation, pass information must be provided at that time to receive the discount. No discounts are offered for the group camping at Oregon Inlet Campground.",
