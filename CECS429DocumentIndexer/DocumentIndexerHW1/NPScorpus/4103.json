Scattered across niches within the vast landscape, the wildflowers range from small and nondescript, to fragrant and colorful, and even to poisonous. Below is a sampling of some of the interesting and beautiful flowers you can discover in the park. To learn more about flower identification, stop by a park visitor center or check with the Everglades Association for guidebooks.
