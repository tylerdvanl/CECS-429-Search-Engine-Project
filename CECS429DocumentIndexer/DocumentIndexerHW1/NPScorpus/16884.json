Â     Summer Schedule:   Through approximately mid-October, limited ranger programs will be offered most days inside the Furnace Creek Visitor Center throughout the summer.   Orientation Talks:  Subject:  Learn about where to go and what to see in Death Valley. Meet: At the large relief map at the bookstore inside the visitor center. When: Most days, but times vary.       Winter Schedule: Park Rangers can introduce you to a new canyon, explore the night sky with you, guide you across the moonlit sand dunes, take you back in time... or just answer your questions!  A variety of Ranger-led programs are offered throughout the winter months from mid-October to mid-April.  For a complete list of programs stop at the Furnace Creek Visitor Center speak to a ranger.  Tours are free except for Scotty's Castle and Lower Vine tours. Some tours require advance registration.  Programs may change for special events or cancelled due to inclement weather.    Paleontology Tours: View several million year old fossil mammal tracks. Although this fragile paleontological resource area is usually closed to the public, there will be three Ranger-led tours on selected dates.    Moon & Star Programs Twice a month something magical happens in Death Valley; a full moon and a new moon. During full moons rangers explore the sand dunes and\/or Badwater by the wondrous light of the moon, view moonrises through binoculars and provide opportunities to learn more about this orb that impacts our lives in ways we never think about. During new moons, when the moon can't be seen and the sky marches out all its stars, rangers set up telescopes and help you explore the wonder of the dark night sky, a disappearing resource that also impacts our lives. Check ranger program schedules for full moon and telescope events and come experience the magic of Death Valley nights.   Scotty's Castle Tours   Scotty's Castle is CLOSED due to damage from a flood on Oct. 18, 2015. It will remain closed until further notice.  See the alerts page above for details. Guided living history House Tours of the beautiful castle interior are a must do for visitors. Underground Tours focus on the technology that Mr. Johnson used in building and living in his castle. Lower Vine Ranch Tours are at the cabin where Death Valley Scotty actually lived. Although the Lower Vine is usually closed to the public, this winter there may be Ranger-led tours on select dates.",
