Under the Organic Act of 1916, the National Park service was established and directed to promote and regulate the use of the National Parks to conserve the scenery, the natural historic objects, and the wild life and to leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations. Yellowstone's purpose and significance is rooted in the intent of its enabling legislation, subsequent legislation and current knowledge of its natural, cultural, and scenic resources. Yellowstone preserves geologic wonders including the world's most extraordinary collection of geysers, hot springs and abundant and diverse wildlife, in one of the largest remaining intact temperate ecosystems on earth. It preserves an 11,000 year continuum of human history, including sites, structures, and events that reflect our shared heritage, and provides for the benefit, enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations. Commitment to sustainability is made more important with a changing climate and increasing impacts to natural resources, locally and globally. Recent executive orders and acts require the Federal Government to protect resources through sustainable operations and facility adaptation. The National Park Service Green Parks Plan provides further direction for environmental stewardship, and has led to a firm commitment and support for Yellowstone's continued leadership in Environmental Stewardship.         The Strategic Plan for Sustainability sets forth goals for operational and infrastructure improvements that reduce impacts on the environment while enhancing visitor experiences and employee living and working conditions. NPS \/ Neal Herbert  Purpose for the Strategic Plan The overall purpose of Yellowstone's Strategic Plan for Sustainability is to present clear direction within a simple framework by which everyone—employees, visitors, and partners—can work collaboratively toward unified goals to make Yellowstone greener. The Strategic Plan for Sustainability sets forth goals for operational and infrastructure improvements that reduce impacts on the environment while enhancing visitor experiences and employee living and working conditions. By building upon service-wide direction, the Strategic Plan for Sustainability focuses on Yellowstone's specific challenges that call for reducing greenhouse gas emissions; energy, water and materials consumption; adapting facilities and conducting operations in an environmentally responsible manner. We plan to communicate all these efforts with transparency and a compelling message, to inspire sustainability efforts within and beyond Yellowstone. This bold vision and road map for the next 5-10 years is a truly collaborative effort. In September 2011, representatives from corporate partners and educational institutions volunteered their time to participate in a \"Greening Yellowstone Symposium.\" The goals and objectives presented here are derived from that symposium, evidence of the hard work and dedication by all who attended:  Andersen Windows & Doors The Coca-Cola Company Delaware North Company Epsten Group, Inc Georgia Tech Research Institute Herman Miller, Inc.
