Watch for the shrub-like naupaka with it half flowers of white. Growing along the lava, you may spot the lavender pohuehue, a native beach morning glory. Walk under the shade of the gracious hala tree, whose leaves are used to weave mats and baskets. Native plants may be either indigenous, meaning that they are found in our island chain as well as other places in the world, or endemic meaning that they are found only in the Hawaiian Islands.",
