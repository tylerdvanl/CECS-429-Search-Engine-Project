Please note the following cautions. • Please be alert to traffic while in the parking lot and while walking along park roads.

The walkways and steps may also be slippery when wet. • Poison ivy is common in the park, especially along the forest edge. If you're unsure what poison ivy looks like the ranger at the visitor center can show you how to identify the plant. • While not common, bees such as yellow jackets are sometimes found in the park. Those with bee sting allergies should be prepared with the appropriate medications. • If you have an accident in the park, or injure yourself, please contact a ranger immediately.
