Â    Participation In the Crayfish Study The Crayfish Study is a project of \"The River Mile,\" a kindergarten through 12th grade watershed health monitoring program. Participation in the Crayfish Study is open to any school group wishing to assist with this important study. If you wish to participate, please contact the program lead for The River Mile. It is important that all groups make sure that their data is correct to the best of their ability, as many resource specialists and scientists are interested in the status of crayfish in the Pacific Northwest. If you have any questionable data, make a notation in any comments section and say why it is questionable. There are several different ways you and your students can participate in this study. At the most basic level go out, look for crayfish, identify their species and note their location (GPS with latitude and longitude). The most advanced level of participation involves setting traps for 24 hour periods of time, collecting core information about the shoreline and water, uploading your data to ArcGIS online maps and sharing your information through your school project website. All levels of participation and observation are contributing very important scientific data. Scientists need to know what species are out there and where. Study Period In Washington the study period is the first Monday in May through October 31st. Please be sure to check the fishing regulations for your area. All groups must conform to their local and state fishing regulations. If you have any questions please contact The River Mile's program lead.
