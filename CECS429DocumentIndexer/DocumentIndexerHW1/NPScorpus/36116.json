Enjoy new tales every month, from animals to adventures to ancient peoples. Meet at the Cultural Center information desk. Facilitated Dialogue Series Once a month, one of our rangers will host an experience which can vary from watching a movie to walking around the park. After the activity, all of the participants are guided through a group conversation related to the topic of that experience. The purpose of this type of program is to give our visitors an opportunity to share the knowledge, feelings and experiences which can be related to the Chamizal story. These programs are a lot of fun because when everyone joins in the dialogue, we all learn so much more.",
