Dominating the background is Battle Mountain. On the slopes of this hill, the Nez Perce kept their horses. On the flat at the base of Battle Mountain is the north fork of the Big Hole River. If you look off to the right, you can see the tipi poles that mark and memorialize the village site that was attacked by Colonel John Gibbon early on the morning of August 9, 1877.   View webcam",
