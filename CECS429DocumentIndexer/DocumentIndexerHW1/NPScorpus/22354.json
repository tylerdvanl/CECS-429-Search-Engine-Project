To help preserve them, observe proper site etiquette:    Remain on marked trails.  Do not climb, sit or stand on any rock walls.  Do not touch or disturb any artifacts, including pottery sherds, arrow points or rock art. Once removed from context, the story they can tell is gone forever.  All cultural resources, structures, and artifacts are fully protected by federal law. Entering structures or canyon interiors is not permitted. (Even stepping over a chain barrier is considered entering a site.)   Trails are open sunrise to sunset.  Additional laws & policies guiding the management of Hovenweep may be found here.",
