On winter weekends January-February, this yurt (a traditional snow-shelter) is staffed during daylight hours by volunteers and park rangers.  Located 1 mile south of the junction of UT-143 and UT-148, the winter ranger station provides a warm welcome to Cedar Breaks for snowmobilers, snowshoers, and cross-country skiers.  * Please be aware that the winter ranger station is only open when park rangers are present, and is not generally open to the public.    Â    What is a Yurt? A yurt is a portable structure that stays cool in the summer, but keeps the warm during the winter. The yurt was invented to be a portable dwelling for nomads. Originally, yurts were constructed with a wooden frame that was tied with rope to help keep it round. The cover was made from wool, sometimes with as many as six layers!  A yurt can stay warm in temperatures as low as -40 degrees! If you are interested in how our yurt was built, check out our winter ranger station construction page! To Get to the Winter Ranger Station in Winter: Drive on Highway 143 until approximately three miles south of Brian Head, at the junction with Utah Highway 148 (Cedar Breaks Scenic Drive). A plowed parking lot is maintained at this junction except during and immediately after snowstorms.  The Winter Ranger Station is located about one mile south of the junction. A snowmobile track follows Highway 148 and is regularly groomed, providing the most direct path to the Winter Ranger Station. Parking at the Winter Ranger Station is only available in the summer and fall due to the high snow levels.
