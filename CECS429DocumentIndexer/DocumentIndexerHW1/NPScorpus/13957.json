It's about taking personal responsibility to respect and care for our limited wildland resources and the experiences of other outdoor enthusiasts. Low-impact skills and knowledge are also an important part of LNT, but without the right attitude and ethic, they are useless. You must commit yourself to apply them, to practice good stewardship. Wilderness ethics dictate that visitors to the area try to leave no trace of their passage. While not regulations, the seven Leave No Trace principles will help you get the most out of your wilderness experience, and help you to preserve the park's unique values for other visitors, both today and in the future.  Plan Ahead and Prepare Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces Dispose of Waste Properly Leave What You Find Minimize Campfire Impacts Respect Wildlife Take Your Trash Out With You  Leave No Trace extends the National Park Service mission to you and challenges you to \"â€¦conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\" Link to http:\/\/www.lnt.org Leave them unimpaired = Leave No Trace",
