NPS       Scientific Name  Plains Spadefoot (Spea bombifrons) or Great Basin spadefoot (Spea intermontana) Special Information A single, juvenile spadefoot toad was identified in the west side of the park on July 31, 2013. As a juvenile, it could not be conclusively identified, though spadefoots have been observed within or near the park boundary in the past. The observation of a juvenile so far inside the park suggests that an active breeding site is nearby.  Identification  Have a single, dark tubercle, or “spade,” on each of their hind feet   Habitat   Uses it’s spade to dig shallow summer burrows or deeper winter burrows. Newly metamorphosed animals may burrow in mud near their natal pond or hide in cracks in the hard earth.  Typically occur in warmer climates in the western United States, and it has been speculated that spadefoots may be found in geothermally influenced habitat in Yellowstone that facilitates overwinter survival.   Behavior   Breeds in ephemeral pools  Larval period is approximately 13 to 20 days       More Information  More about Amphibians: Blotched Tiger Salamander, Boreal Chorus Frog, Boreal Toad, Columbia Spotted Frog, and Spadefoot Toad",
