Even before the official establishment of the National Park Service in 1916, there was an interest in developing educational resources and programs to help teach visitors about the natural and cultural features of the national parks. Today, with the realization that our National Park System offers some of the richest educational opportunities imaginable, almost all units of NPS offer some form of educational or interpretive program, such as ranger-led walks, video presentations, and in some cases, more formal curriculum-based activities. By using these sites to \"bring history to life,\" educators can help students connect social studies, history, geography, and other subjects to their own lives. Students not only learn better, but also come to appreciate the value of the nation's cultural resources.  The staff at Charles Pinckney National Historic Site extends to you and your class an invitation to join us in these famous outdoor classrooms. National Parks are real places where you and your students can experience the power of history.   Check out the current Lesson Plans and Teachers Guides and do not hesitate to ask for more information on what Charles Pinckney National Historic Site has to offer you!
