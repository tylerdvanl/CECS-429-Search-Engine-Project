History of the Egg Roll In the 1870s, Capitol Hill had become a popular spot for children to roll eggs - and themselves - down the hill on Easter Monday. As the event grew more popular, the toll on the grounds was noticeable. In 1876, Congress passed a law forbidding the Capitol grounds to be used as a children's playground. In 1878, President Rutherford B. Hayes issued an order that if any children should come to the White House to roll their Easter eggs, they would be allowed to do so. The tradition has been carried on since, and has grown into the major event you can experience today. Volunteer We need you! Find out how you can become a Easter Egg Roll Volunteer!
