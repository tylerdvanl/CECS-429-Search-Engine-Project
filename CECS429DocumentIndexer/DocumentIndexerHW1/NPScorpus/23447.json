    "title": "Chaco Culture National Historical Park: Mortar Repair",
    "body": "Mortar Repair        Original mortar, once protected by upper story roofs or wall plasters, is now exposed and suffers erosion by snow melt and precipitation. To repair deteriorating mortar, the first step is to analyze the original mortar to identify its particular texture, color, and composition. Next, the preservation staff documents the existing architectural elements and develops mortar with similar characteristics. Eroded mortar is replaced with new mud, an important and tedious task, but one that is effective in keeping the masonry walls sound and structurally solid to resist the weather and visitor use.
