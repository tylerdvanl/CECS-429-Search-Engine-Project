Hired by Thomas Edison in 1888, he oversaw the first methodical production of musical recordings for the wax cylinder phonograph at Edison's West Orange, New Jersey laboratory in 1888-89 and then played a prominent role in introducing the same invention to continental Europe. Until now, he has been best known as the technician who recorded Johannes Brahms at the piano in Vienna on December 2, 1889. This cylinder is of great historical interest, but it is badly damaged and does not do justice to Wangemann's legacy as an expert recordist. In 2011, the National Park Service digitized a box of unique wax cylinder recordings made by Wangemann during his European trip of 1889-90. The recordings include the voices of the eminent German historical figures Otto von Bismarck and Helmuth von Moltke, several performances by important musicians of the period, and even a home recording in which some of Wangemann's relatives send greetings to family members who had emigrated to America a decade earlier. The Moltke recordings have special interest as the only known examples we can listen to today of the voice of someone born in the eighteenth century. Overall, these recordings give us a cross-section of the pioneering work of the first-ever professional recording engineer. The recordings are available here in MP3 format.
