Restricted to riparian areas (those among streambeds) in rocky canyons, the canyon treefrog is often found in groups among boulders, to which it clings using its large adhesive toepads. They avoid predators using their natural camouflage and by limiting movement to when a predator comes near. Length: 1 ¼ - 2 ¼ inches. Diet: Insects",
