Born and raised in the Great Basin, 2010 Darwin Lambert Artist-in-Residence recipient Mike Hess is best described as a prolific painter. Retiring from the Nevada Department of Wildlife in 1999, Mike began his second career as an artist. With acrylics on canvas as his medium, Mike paints \"plein air\", a French term for painting outdoors. During his two week residency, Hess explored the park and filled his canvases with some of the park's magnificent scenery. A number of visitors participated in his \"plein air\" demonstration and program.   \"Great Basin National Park is an undiscovered jewel for artists,\" says Hess. \"When the aspens change in the fall the hikes at Wheeler Peak are stunningly beautiful, a painter's dream.\"   Mr. Hess resides in Sparks, Nevada and is a member of the Artist Cooperative of Reno. Hess' paintings have won many awards and he exhibits his works in galleries in the Reno area.       Great Basin by Mike Hess, October 2010.         Jeff Davis by Mike Hess, October 2010.",
