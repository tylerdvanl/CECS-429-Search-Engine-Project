    "body": "Ranger-led Programs         An early ranger leading a campfire program. NPS Photo  Since the early days of the National Park Service, rangers have shared their knowledge through the presentation of interpretive programs--guided walks, talks, and campfire programs for visitors of all ages. Today, that long-standing tradition continues. Please join the Mount Rainier interpretive staff for a variety of free programs, ranging from informal talks at park visitor centers to junior ranger programs for kids to evening campfire programs. Topics vary from day to day, and may include geology, wildlife, ecology, mountaineering, or park history. Most programs are available from late-June until Labor Day. Schedules are posted throughout the park, as well as in the park newspaper. Details and short descriptions of some evening programs are also available in the calender of events.      Find the program to fit your visit  Most ranger-led programs are offered in the summer months, typically July-September, in locations throughout the park. However, guided snowshoe walks and other programs are offered in the winter at Paradise.
