    "body": "Traveling with Pets         In the concession-run kennel, only water is provided but you may bring in bedding for your pet's comfort. NPS photo  Be aware that desert temperatures, thorny vegetation, and predators may be a serious threat to your pet's well-being. Please consider the following points before deciding to bring a pet:   Pets are not allowed on park trails, off road, at bat flight, in the visitor center or in the cave.   Pets need to be on a leash no longer than six feet in length when outside your vehicle.   You are not allowed to leave your pet unattended in vehicles if the outdoor temperature will reach 70 degrees (F) and above, as it creates a danger to the animal. On warm days temperatures in closed motor vehicles can rise quickly to levels dangerous to the life and health of animals. Unattended pets will be removed from vehicles at the discretion of law enforcement if the animal is showing signs of distress.   Pet etiquette and park regulations require that you always clean up after your pet and dispose of waste in trash receptacles.   KENNEL INFORMATION  The park concessioner, Carlsbad Caverns Trading Company, operates a kennel service where, for a $10\/day fee, you may leave your pet in a temperature controlled environment while you tour the cave. The kennel is for day use only - no overnight stays. Their hours of operation are 8:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. (Tuesday after Labor Day through Thursday before Memorial Day). 8:30 a.m. 6:30 p.m. (Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend).  They do not take reservations, service is provided on a first-come, first-served basis.  They rarely run out of cage space, but if they do the larger cages go first. There are three sizes of cages, length x height x width in inches:   Extra tall:  47 x 32 x 24 Medium:  47 x 24 x 24 Small:  23 x 24 x 24   Pets are kept in cages relative to their size, such as a small dog in a small cage. Water is provided for the pet, but the owner must provide food or bedding if they feel it's needed. The concessioner accepts no responsibility for injuries that might occur during a pet's stay in the kennels and does not require any vaccination records for the pet. Employees do not handle pets and do not remain in the kennel room with the pets. If you have more specific questions, contact them at 575-785-2281.",
