Ruiz  On June 12, 2011, at approximately 1:15 pm, a fire started within the park, rapidly burning through the grasslands, heading in a northeasterly direction. The Monument Fire continued to burn through the park, and beyond, eventually burning over 29,000 acres within the Huachuca Mountains. No structures were lost in the park, but 100% of the park's acreage was burned to some extent. Some areas burned intensely, while other areas are still green. A burned landscape presents a number of safety hazards that either did not exist prior to the fire or are increased by the effects of the fire. In some cases these hazardous conditions may continue for several years after a fire. Be very aware of your surroundings, follow warning signs and directions from park staff and pay particular attention to these potential safety hazards.
