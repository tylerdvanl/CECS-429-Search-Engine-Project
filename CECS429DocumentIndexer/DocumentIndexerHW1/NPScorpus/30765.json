NPS PHOTO   The Volunteers In Parks (VIP) program in the National Park Service is an integral part of daily operations in the nearly 400 park units in the system. Volunteers bring expertise, and often allow the parks to offer more diverse programming to the public.  The VIP program at Fort Stanwix National Monument has had a long and rich history, starting with the creation of the Fort Stanwix Garrison volunteer organization back in 1975. Since then, VIPs have helped the park to share its stories with visitors from all over the United States and all over the world as well.  You can learn more about the many different VIP Opportunities at Fort Stanwix by visiting the park New VIP Opportunities Page.
