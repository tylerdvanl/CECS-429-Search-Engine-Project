    "body": "Amphibians         The Green Tree frog is one of fifteen frog and toad species that call the Natchez Trace Parkway home. US Fish and Wildlife Image  Amphibians abound along the Natchez Trace Parkway. Stroll down one of the parkâ€™s many wetland paths and one of these cold-blooded vertebrates may be only a hop, skip or jump away. Fifteen species of frogs, from big Bullfrogs to stealthy Leopard frogs, are known to live within the woods and wetlands preserved along the parkway. Spring Peepers, Bird-voiced frogs, and Cricket frogs may serenade a patient visitor who finds a quiet place and spends a few minutes listening. Peer into a quiet pond in springtime and be prepared to spy a tadpole.   Newts and salamanders are plentiful within the park as well. To observe the Slimy salamander or Three-toed amphiuma, you may have to slow down and look closely. The Red-spotted newt and Mole salamander are likewise masters of camouflage. Unfortunately, our amphibians are very vulnerable to traffic, particularly south of Interstate 20 in Mississippi. They frequently try to cross the parkway between December and March in an attempt to reach their breeding pools. Click here to find out how you can help.
