NPS Photo  The Natchez Trace Parkway offers opportunities for teachers to help students develop a depth of understanding for the world around them. The Parkway covers 10,000 years of human history; includes 52,000 acres of land embracing four ecosystems and eight watersheds; and also provides a variety of healthy and fun outdoor recreational opportunities. Our education program reflects this diversity and provides opportunities for teachers to use the park as a classroom for a teaching tool both in the classroom or in the field. Rangers may be available to lead field trips or visit your school as a guest speaker. Teachers are always welcome to use our lesson plans and lead their own field trips. The Natchez Trace Parkway also provides professional development opportunities and volunteer experiences for both active and retired teachers. The Natchez Trace Parkway staff covers three states, Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee. Visit Parks as Classrooms page for a complete list of educational opportunities.
