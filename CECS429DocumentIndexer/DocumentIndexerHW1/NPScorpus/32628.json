    "body": "Day Trip Information       If you have an entire day: Enjoy a cruise to an island to explore a historic lighthouse, hike a forested trail, or wiggle your toes in the sand of a pristine beach. The Apostle Islands Cruise Service offers shuttles to some islands, where you may visit a lighthouse, hike, picnic, bird-watch, or beach-comb during the layover on an island. For this year's schedule of shuttles, visit their website at apostleislands.com. Recreational boating is very popular in the Apostle Islands. Captained day charters are available for visitors seeking to experience sailing in the Apostles. Outfitters in Bayfield also rent sea kayaks and guide day trips to the sea caves along the mainland portion of the national lakeshore. Lists of charter services and outfitters is available as a pdf file.",
