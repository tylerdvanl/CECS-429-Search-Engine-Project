She learned her letters and numbers by age four and was featured in the Montessori system's national brochure. A talented pianist, Margaret also liked to garden, read Shakespeare, and research French and Russian literature, Asian culture, and mythology.Margaret was her father's librarian for the mass amount of books at Connemara. She helped edit many of his works and was instrumental in helping the National Park Service capture the story and spirit of her father once the Park had been established. Margaret died April 12, 1997, at 85.\"Margaret has become widely read, a scholar who often surprises me with her erudition, knows the Bible and Shakespeare better than I do.\"Carl Sandburg, letter to Alfred HarcourtSeptember 24, 1953        Lilian and Janet in 1916   Second Daughter: Janet Sixteen MonthsOn the lips of the child Janet float changing dreams.It is a thin spiral of blue smoke,A morning campfire at a mountain lake.On the lips of the child Janet,Wisps of haze on ten miles of corn,Young light blue calls to the light gold of morning.Carl Sandburg, Cornhuskers, 1918 Janet Mary Steichen Sandburg was born June 27, 1916. Carl wrote in a letter to a friend a few months later saying: \" Janet, the new kid, has her mother's hair and face whereas the other daughter, has mine: so the household is at a glorious standoff.\" Herbert Mitgang, The Letters of Carl SandburgJanet Sandburg was quiet and shy around people, but around animals, she thrived.   This proved useful around the farm as her main job at Connemara was feeding and caring for the baby goats, accompanying her mother to goat shows, and helping with gardening and housekeeping. Janet died on February 16, 2001; she was 85.        Helga with her father, Stewart Udall, and President Kennedy (left to right).

Initially named Mary Ellen, after a friend, Helga was given her new, Swedish name soon after her father's return home.Like her literary father, Helga enjoyed writing. In 1958, she won the Emily Clark Balch prize for \"Witch Chicken,\" published in the Virginia Quarterly Review. In addition to her published books, her work appeared in Saturday Review, Harper's, The New Yorker, McCall 's, Seventeen, and Georgia Review. Helga shared her mother's affinity for animals and raised not only goats, but registered Siamese cats and Doberman Pinschers, and cared for Black Angus cattle, chickens, ducks, geese, and honey bees. As the only Sandburg daughter to marry, she raised two children, John Carl and Paula. Visit our Virtual Museum Exhibit to learn more information on Margaret, Janet, and Helga Sandburg .",
