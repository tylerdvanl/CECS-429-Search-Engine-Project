Air Tour Management Plan The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), in cooperation with the National Park Service (NPS), has initiated development of an Air Tour Management Plan (ATMP) and associated Environmental Assessment (EA) for Death Valley National Park, pursuant to the National Parks Air Tour Management Act of 2000. An ATMP is being developed to provide measures to mitigate or prevent significant adverse impacts, if any, of commercial air tour operations at the Park, including impacts on natural and cultural resources, visitor experiences, and tribal lands within or around the park. It should be noted that the ATMP has no authorization over other non-air-tour aircraft such as military and general aviation aircraft.
