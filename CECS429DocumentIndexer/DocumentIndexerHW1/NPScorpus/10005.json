    "body": "Animals         A black skimmer wades in the swash zone. Margo Zdravkovic  Gulf Islands National Seashore is listed as a National Watchable Wildlife Area. The Seashore's diverse habitats provide resting, feeding and nesting areas for a variety of wildlife. Amphibians, reptiles and mammals can be seen on the offshore islands, on the mainland and in the waters of the Seashore. Although the numbers of certain animals such as raccoons are abundant, they are seldom seen during the day due to their nocturnal behavior. Sharp eyes and ears will help you discover wildlife. The best time to view amphibians is in the evening or following rain. Reptiles are easily observed in the afternoons during the cool months, while mammals are best spotted in the early morning and evening hours. Federal laws protect all wild animals within the park. The staff is involved with the recovery plans initiated by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service to maximize habitat protection and to better ensure the perpetuation of the 12 federally listed threatened or endangered species including the Perdido Key Beach Mouse within Gulf Islands National Seashore.  Please keep wildlife wild by not feeding or harassing them. By protecting the park's natural resources, the Seashore will be preserved for all to enjoy!",
