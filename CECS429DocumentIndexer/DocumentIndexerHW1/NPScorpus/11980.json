Riding a horse in a multi-use environment requires even a higher level of awareness. Remember, safety starts with the individual! Reading and following these tips will make sure we keep our parks a pleasant place to visit.    Safety   Stay on maintained trails and observe all posted signs. It is best to ride with a buddy and tell someone where you are going and when you expect to return.  Watch for overhanging branches from shrubs and trees. Keep horses at a walk when passing other visitors and stay to the uphill side.  Carry first-aid and your vetâ€™s phone number in case of emergency.
