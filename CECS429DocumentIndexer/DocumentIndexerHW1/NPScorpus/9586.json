Are you willing to learn original manuals and move heavy pieces of artillery in the blazing sun? Honor and represent those original Defenders who so gallantly and selflessly preserved Baltimore and inspired our national anthem by portraying them on the original ramparts! How YOU can help: Individuals with a high level of physical stamina help visitors understand the history of Fort McHenry by dressing in period correct clothing representing a soldier or civilian of 1814 and performing everyday duties and tasks. Military living history volunteers interpret the daily life of the fort, talking with visitors about barrack life, rations, drill, guard mount, and the battle in 1814. Civilian living history volunteers interpret the social life of Baltimore during the battle, the tavern that existed onsite in 1814, and the role that women played as laundresses to the garrison. Volunteers are trained by black powder specialists on how to fire muskets and artillery. Musically inclined volunteers may apply to the Fifes & Drums of the Fort. Civilian volunteers boil laundry over open fires.
