Tucson teachers are familiar with challenges education faces locally as well as barriers that prevent young people and their families from connecting with the park. Their experience as teachers and knowledge of the park will promote park relevance and will contribute to the preservation and protection of the park.         NPS  Park Contacts: Chip Littlefield  Saguaro National Park                                               (520) 733-5157 chip_littlefield@nps.gov    Saguaro National Park TRT Position Description - Environmental Education\/ Interpretation",
