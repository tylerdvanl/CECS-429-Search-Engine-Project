The Friends works closely with NPS staff and volunteers to sponsor events such as the 1940's-Style Sweetheart Hangar Dance at Pearson Air Museum and 1860s Vintage Base Ball, and looks forward to supporting future activities throughout the site. They will also serve as the park's cooperating association and operate the Bookstore in the visitor center. Education & Programmatic Partnerships The park partners on education programming with the Confluence, a non-profit organization located within the national park at the historic Pearson Headquarters Building, that connects people to place through art and education. They work in collaboration with Northwest communities, tribes and renowned artist Maya Lin to create reflective moments that can shape the future of the Columbia River system. They share stories of this river through six public art installations, educational programs, community engagement and a rich digital experience. Their six projects span 438 miles from the mouth of the Columbia River to the gateway to Hell's Canyon, with sites in both Oregon and Washington, and include the Land Bridge that connect's the national park's Village and Columbia River waterfront. Fort Vancouver National Historic Site has a partnership with the Department of Anthropology and the Department of History at Portland State University that engages National Park Service subject matter experts as adjunct faculty members to instruct students in relevant coursework, including the popular annual Public Archaeology Field School and the biennial Public History Field School. The park partners with the Community Military Appreciation Committee (CMAC) on events such as the annual Memorial Day Celebration and protocols and responsibilities at the Clark County Veterans Memorial, located within the national park. The McLoughlin Memorial Association (MMA), one of the longest-operating historic preservation non-profit organizations in the Pacific Northwest, is a park partner that supports operations and activities at the park's McLoughlin House Unit in Oregon City, OR. The MMA hosts events including the annual MMA Founders Day, helps recruit docents, operates a bookstore in the Barclay House, and provides financial support for programs and operations at the site. Legislated Partnerships At the Vancouver National Historic Reserve, the National Park Service is a legislated partner and works in concert with the City of Vancouver, the State of Washington, and the United States Army.  The 366-acre Reserve was established in 1996 (Public Law 104-333, Section 502). Though not a unit of the National Park System, it is an affiliated area, making the Reserve eligible for technical and financial aid from the National Park Service. Congress gave national status to the area when it established the Reserve. As part of a public\/private partnership, Congress historically provided support to the Reserve through annual appropriations that match other public and private funds. A cooperative agreement signed by the Reserve Partners provides for specific funding and program support for various Reserve functions.  The National Park Service is the lead Reserve Partner for interpretation, education, and cultural resource protection. Leadership in these areas provides an important contribution in fulfilling the goals of the Vancouver National Historic Reserve Cooperative Management Plan.",
