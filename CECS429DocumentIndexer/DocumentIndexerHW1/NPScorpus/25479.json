Please visit the Naknek River cam on explore.org for more reliable access.  Location: Naknek River in King Salmon, AK.  When to Watch: The Naknek River is usually frozen until early or mid March. Once the ice on the river breaks, waterfowl numbers begin to increase and usually peak in late April and early May. Beluga whales are typically seen on incoming tides from mid April to mid May. Watch this cam during 1-2 hours before the peak of high tide for the best chance to see beluga whales. You can download tide charts for King Salmon to best time your waterfowl and wildlife watching experience.  What to Look For: In the spring, this camera provides intimate views of waterfowl like ducks, geese, and swans as well as the exciting spectacle of beluga whales swimming upriver to feed. Watch the mudflats and shallow areas adjacent to the riverbanks for dabbling waterfowl like pintails, mallards, American widgeon, green-winged teal, greater-white fronted geese, and tundra swans. Diving ducks like scaup, goldeneyes, and mergansers use the deeper stretches of the river. Beluga whales usually swim upriver chasing schools of smelt on incoming tides. 1-2 hours before the highest, high tide of the day is usually best for watching beluga whales.
