A BioBlitz is an amazing opportunity to explore, document, and help protect the biodiversity of our wonderful national parks for the next 100 years. This year, in partnership with National Geographic, the National Park Service is conducting a nation-wide bioblitz. First State is one of six showcase National Park Service units outside the Washington DC area to participate in the May 20-21 event. Students from local schools will participate on Friday, May 20, and the public is invited to participate on Saturday, May 21.   The Beaver Valley unit is located just 10 minutes from downtown Wilmington and we are eager to engage our park neighbors and partners, and to provide the opportunity for visitors to connect with each other over a shared interest in citizen-science and park stewardship.  A festival area will include educational activities and exhibits by the National Park Service, The Nature Conservancy and other non-profit and educational organizations. Exhibitors will help visitors understand biodiversity by promoting citizen science, advocating stewardship of nature, encouraging artistic expression, discussing natural resource management issues and engaging youth. We are also collecting oral histories of the area and invite you to stop by the HistoryBlitz booth to share original photographs and documents showing how Beaver Valley\/the Woodlawn Tract has changed over time. Weather can be unpredictable at this time of year. Participants should be prepared and dress appropriately. All should wear closed-toe-shoes, bring water and use sun protection. Come have fun with us! Help us look for bugs, identify plants, and learn about the national park in your backyard! Bring your lunch and enjoy the picnic area nearby.  Continue to Event Details>>",
