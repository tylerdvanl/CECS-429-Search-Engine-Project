    "body": "Bicycling Information       Sagamore Hill is, particularly on weekends, a popular destination for bicyclists. However, most people who ride here are residents who live nearby and they are familiar with the area's winding, hilly and narrow roads. Visitors should use extreme caution if they plan to ride a bike along Route 106, Route 25A or Cove Road as conditions are not ideal. Once visitors arrive at the park, they should be aware of the following conditions:  Bicycle riding is permitted only in the main parking lot adjacent to the Visitor Center and on the Old Orchard access road. Bicycles may be walked along the paved pathways between buildings. Bicycles may not be taken off paved surfaces. They must not be taken on the nature trail or on the beach area. Bicycle racks are available outside the Old Orchard Museum and Visitor Center.",
