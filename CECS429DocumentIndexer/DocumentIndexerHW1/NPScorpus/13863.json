Library of Congress (National Photo Company Collection, Prints & Photographs), LC-F81-28049.  In November 1923, First Lady Grace Coolidge gave permission for the District of Columbia Public Schools to erect a Christmas tree on the Ellipse south of the White House. The organizers named the tree the \"National Christmas Tree.\" That Christmas Eve, at 5 pm, President Calvin Coolidge walked from the White House to the Ellipse and \"pushed the button\" to light the cut 48-foot Balsam fir, as 3,000 enthusiastic spectators looked on. The tree, donated by Middlebury College, was from the President's native state of Vermont. From 1924 to 1953 live trees, in various locations around and on the White House grounds, were lit on Christmas Eve. In 1954 the ceremony returned to the Ellipse and expanded its focus. Local civic and business groups created the Christmas Pageant of Peace. Smaller live trees representing the 50 states, five territories, and the District of Columbia, formed a Pathway of Peace. On December 17, 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower lit the cut tree donated by the people of Michigan. Cut trees continued to be used until 1973. Central to the season's celebration is the living National Christmas Tree, a Colorado blue spruce from Virginia. Planted on the Ellipse on October 27, 2012, this tree replaces another Colorado blue spruce from New Jersey that succumbed to transplant shock in May 2012.  Today, the National Christmas Tree stands as a daily reminder of the holiday spirit and of the tradition each succeeding President has participated in since 1923.",
