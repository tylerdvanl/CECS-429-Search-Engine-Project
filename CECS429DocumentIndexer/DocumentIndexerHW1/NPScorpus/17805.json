Please contact us if you have any great ideas!  Physical\/Mobility: The John Muir visitor center offers accessible restrooms.   An easy access path offers a less steep route for visitors to reach the Strentzel-Muir house.   For visitors who are unable to walk to the house, a ranger will gladly provide transportation via a golf cart.   A wheelchair lift allows access to the home's first floor. The wheelchair lift has a 500-lb combined weight limit for each person and his or her wheelchair. A non-motorized wheelchair is available for use on a first-come, first-served basis. Motorized scooters are not permitted in the Strentzel-Muir house or the Martinez Adobe due to the hazards of uneven surfaces and to protect the integrity of these historic buildings. The first floor of the Martinez Adobe and Juan Bautista De Anza National Historic Trail exhibit is also accessible from the south side. ADA approved picnic tables are available as well. There is a video of the second floor of the Muir home, which can be played by the staff, on request, in the Muir home dining room.  Deaf\/Hearing Loss: The park provides audio listening devices and audio description for the park film. The main park film is also closed-captioned. Blind\/Low Vision: The main park brochure is available in braille, please inquire at the front desk for a copy that can be borrowed.  One of John Muir's great-grandchildren, Michael Muir, continues in kind with a dedication to getting ALL humans into the outdoors. Please click on the following link for: Access Adventure",
