This self-guided walking path is located on Bureau of Land Management Land to view Split Rock, an important emigrant landmark in Wyoming.   The Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail is recognized as a nationally significant resource relevant to the westward expansion of the United States. Although administered by the National Park Service, it is not like a typical national park with borders. Rather, it is an historic \"road\" or route used by hundreds of thousands of emigrants between the mid 1840s and early 1870s as they made their way west to begin a new life or to seek their fortune.  There are many historic sites, museums, and parks (federal, state, and local) along the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail. Operating hours vary from site to site.  Operating hours and seasons for trail resources and sites of interest along this 1,300 mile route vary with each site and facility. Many private and agency museums and interpretive centers exist from Illinois to Utah. Please visit the Links & Resources page for a listing of trail managers and contact information, as well as a bibliography of suggested reading materials. For more information, contact individual sites by going to Places To Go and Passport Program pages, where sites are listed by state, and there is an interactive map to search for sites. We have trip planning guides to help you follow the trail. They can be found on the Publications web page. See also: Suggested Trail Sites to enhance your trail experience.
