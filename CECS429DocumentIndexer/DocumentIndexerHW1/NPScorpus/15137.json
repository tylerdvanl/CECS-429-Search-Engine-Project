Call to report accidents, fires or life threatening incidents.  Cell phone coverage is very limited within the park.  If no phone service is available emergencies should be reported to rangers on patrol, campground hosts or staff at the Kohm Yah-mah-nee Visitor Center or Loomis Museum.     Hydrothermal Area Danger   For your safety stay on the established trails and boardwalks.  Ground in hydrothermal areas can look solid, but may actually be a thin crust hiding pools of acidic boiling water or mud.  Traveling off trail in these areas may result in severe injury.   Visitors have been burned while traveling off trail.     A visitor was severely burned in the summer of 2010 after he traveled off trail in the Devil's Kitchen hydrothermal area.  He stated that \"It feels like I put my leg in a flame.\" On May 5, 2012 a visitor was airlifted to a regional burn unit after stepping off the sidewalk at Sulphur Works.  The ground appeared solid, but she easily broke through the one-inch crust, exposing her foot and ankle to boiling acidic water and mud.      Wildlife Safety and Safe Viewing Distances   Any animal can be dangerous if it feels threatened, surprised or concerned by your presence.   Never feed wildlife Animals that obtain food from humans become dangerous - even small creatures like squirrels can become bold and bite children or adults pursuing food once they have been conditioned to humans feeding them.   You are responsible to use bear-proof storage lockers and keep a clean camp. In doing so, wildlife will not be fed in-advertantly.   Observe safe viewing distances from all animals.  Do not approach or disturb wildlife.  When on foot:    Black Bears: Stay 100 yards or more away Other wildlife (e.g. Mule deer, foxes, raptor nests): Stay 25 yards or more away   Learn more about black bear safety.",
