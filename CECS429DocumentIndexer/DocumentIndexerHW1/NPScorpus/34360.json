    "body": "Explore This Park    Learn About the Park     Education     Parks as Classrooms     Field Trips                 Field Trips       You have several choices when planning your class field trip to Colonial NHP - Historic Jamestowne. We recommend these four steps. First, review the available educational programs and select the one which meets your class needs. Second, if you decide on a ranger-led program make your reservations at least two months and no more that five months in advance using Colonial NHP - Historic Jamestowne's reservation procedures. Third, determine if your educational institution qulifies for an Academic Fee Waiver of park entrance fees and if so submit your application for this fee waiver. Fourth, review the parks rules for visitor\/student behavior (visitor etiquette). Remember, your students are the ambassadors of your school. IMPORTANT GROUP LEADER: When you arrive, please have your group remain outside the visitor center while YOU check in at the fee desk. If students need to use the restrooms, only 15 students may enter the building at a time accompanied by an adult. If more than 15 students need to use the restrooms, cycle groups of 15 in and out of the building until everyone is finished.",
