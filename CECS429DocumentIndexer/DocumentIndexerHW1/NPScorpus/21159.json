    "body": "Kids & Youth       History is Everywhere   In nearly 400 national parks and every hometown. It covers everything from the remnants of ancient civilizations to the boyhood homes of U.S. Presidents to the stirring sagas of hard-fought wars to the reverberations of one woman refusing to give up her seat on a bus. History is a part of who we were, who we are, and who we will be.   As you explore these pages, we hope you find what you are looking for – but even more importantly, we hope you discover something that surprises you. We invite you to learn more about history and how the National Park Service works to preserve it.  Feeling adventurous? Do you like to find things that are lost? Figure out stories from clues? Then dig into Archeology for Kids.  How about a little time travel? Take a fabulous trip through more than 3,000 years in The Great American Landmarks Adventure. You'll start with a 1,500-year-old cave painting and end up on the moon in 1969.  From the first shots of the American Revolution through the Cold War of the late 1950s, learn about some of our nation's heroes in American Defenders of Land, Sea & Sky. Explore, learn, and have fun!        NPS  Junior Ranger Program   The Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail Junior Ranger program is designed for visitors between the ages of 6-12. To become a Junior Ranger our young visitors must complete several activities in the Junior Ranger booklet. The booklets can be obtained from one of our rangers. It generally takes an hour to complete the program and gives our young visitors, and their parents, a good background into the history of the Selma to Montgomery march. At the successful completion of the booklet, each prospective Junior Ranger will be awarded a badge designating them a Junior Ranger of The Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail.        NPS  Be a WebRanger Now you can be a Junior Ranger even if you are not able to visit a national park.
