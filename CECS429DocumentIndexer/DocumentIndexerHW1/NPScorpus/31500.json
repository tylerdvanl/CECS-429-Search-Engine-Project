Summer Job Opportunities for Youth Looking for a different, exciting summer job that challenges you and trains you in new skills? Full-time students can apply for summer work at National Parks throughout New York Harbor through two dynamic programs. The Youth Conservation Corps (YCC) places students, age 15-18, in a variety of duties at National Parks in New York Harbor. To learn more about, and apply for this program, visit the NPNH Youth Conservation Corps webpage. See and hear what YCC students in the summer of 2009 had to say about their work experience in these video podcasts. The Youth Intern Program (YIP) invites full-time college students to make a multi-year commitment to work for the National Park Service as they prepare for a career with the agency. Interns work 40 hours per week in the summer and intermittently during the rest of the year. Work on weekends may be required. Returning YIP interns are expected to mentor new recruits.
