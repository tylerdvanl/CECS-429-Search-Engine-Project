Wear sun screen and a hat and carry plenty of water. Fill your water bottles before leaving the visitor center, as there is no running water along the Loop Drive. The lava surface is uneven and abrasive, so please stay on designated trails and wear hiking boots or sturdy shoes. Trail Descriptions >>>",
