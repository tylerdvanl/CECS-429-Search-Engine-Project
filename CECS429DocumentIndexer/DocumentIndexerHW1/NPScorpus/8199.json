After spending a night at Glacier Park Lodge, visitors climbed on horseback to travel to Two Medicine for a night in one of several rustic chalets or canvas tipis built by the Great Northern Railway. From Two Medicine, a system of backcountry tent camps and chalets within the park allowed these adventurous visitors to live in Glacier's wild interior. Backpackers and dayhikers find this area rich in scenery, providing those willing to travel by foot into the mountains with a true wilderness experience. Tenderfeet can also venture off the roads and into the wild with a casual boat tour on Two Medicine Lake.  Today, Two Medicine has become a somewhat off-the-beaten-path discovery for most park visitors. Once discovered however it's easy to see why many people consider this their favorite part of Glacier National Park. Amazing vistas, extensive trails, crashing waterfalls, and sparkling lakes await.
