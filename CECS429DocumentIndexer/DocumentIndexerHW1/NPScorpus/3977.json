These are butterflies that are native to South Florida.Park staff are reviewing trail management techniques to develop strategies that won't affect this habitat so that we can reinstate trail management in the future. For now the trail remains open but you should be aware of terrain that should be traversed carefully and may have vegetation, branches, or other flora and fauna that could affect your hike.
