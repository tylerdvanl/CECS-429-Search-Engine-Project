NPS Photo  The Mormon Pioneer Trail closely followed the route taken by emigrants heading to the Oregon and California territories in the 1840s - 60s. In the early 1860s, the Pony Express mail service followed the Great Platte River Road across Nebraska and the Sweetwater River in Wyoming. When it reached the Salt Lake Valley, it continued across the deserts of the Great Basin and into California. The Mormon Pioneer, Oregon, California, and Pony Express are all designated as national historic trails. Although the Mormons tried hard to avoid contact with other emigrant travelers, at times they all crossed paths - sometimes by chance and sometimes out of necessity.
