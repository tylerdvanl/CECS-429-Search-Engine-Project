    "body": "Photography\/Filming Permit       All commercial filming requires a permit. Commercial filming is defined as digital or film recording of a visual image or sound recording by a person, business, or other entity for a market audience, such as for a documentary, television or feature film, advertisement, or similar project. It does not include news coverage or visitor use. Still photography activities require a permit only when: a. the activity takes place at location(s) where or when members of the public are generally not allowed; or b. the activity uses model(s), sets(s), or prop(s) that are not a part of the location's natural or cultural resources or administrative facilities; or c. the park would incur additional administrative costs to monitor the activity; d. The park needs to provide management and oversight to: 1. avoid impairment or incompatible use of the resources and values of the park, or 2. limit resource damage, or 3. minimize health or safety risks to the visiting public. News coverage does not require a permit, for either filming or still photography, but is subject to time, place, and manner restrictions, if warranted, to maintain order and ensure the safety of the public and the media, and protect natural and cultural resources.
