They accepted hospitality from several American Indian villages or rancherías. Some rancherías became repeated stopping places (parajes) along the various routes. Spaniards established missions for the religious and social conversion of American Indians. Because many missions were short lived, some comprised no more than a few jacales, primitive wattle-and-daub structures made of poles and mud with a thatch roof. Despite moving to new locations, often changing names as they did so, the majority of Spanish missions in Texas were unsuccessful in their efforts to convert American Indians to Christianity.
