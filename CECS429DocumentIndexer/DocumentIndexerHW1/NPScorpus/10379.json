The UWCA is a partnership of Wilderness Inquiry, the Mississippi River Fund, and the National Park Service, with support and involvement of many additional groups. Large voyageur canoes offer safe paddling experiences for up to ten persons per canoe and 150 persons or more at one time. NPS Park Rangers lead educational activities on the nature and history of the river and provide teacher support services, while Wilderness Inquiry staff coordinates trip logistics. Both Rangers and Wilderness Inquiry staff stern the canoes. See Urban Wilderness Canoe Adventures to set up a field trip for your school or other group, or to register for a public paddling trip.",
