On this trail, you will encounter Hawaiian heiau, holua sled courses and the dramatic Keanae'e cliffs. This ancient trail existed long before Europeans arrived in Hawaii and originally connected coastal villages along the South Kona Coast. In the 1800's the trail was expanded to accommodate those traveling in horse-drawn carriages. Plan a safe and fun hike.  Bring sturdy walking shoes, sunscreen and plenty of water.",
