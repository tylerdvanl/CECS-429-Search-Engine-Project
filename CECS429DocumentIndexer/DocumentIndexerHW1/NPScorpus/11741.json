    "body": "Amateur Radio Activation at the Point Reyes Lighthouse          Saturday, August 20, & Sunday, August 21, 2015 9 am to 5 pm at the Point Reyes Lighthouse Each year, amateur radio organizations across the world sponsor several activities to increase awareness of our lighthouse heritage. One of these events includes International Lighthouse-Lightship Weekend, which will be observed in 2016 from August 20 & 21. To celebrate this international heritage event, Valley of the Moon Amateur Radio Club (VOMARC), in partnership with Point Reyes National Seashore, will activate a temporary radio station at the Point Reyes Lighthouse. Visitors to the Point Reyes Lighthouse are invited to view the temporary radio station from 9 am to 5 pm (1600Z to 2359Z) on Saturday, August 20, & Sunday, August 21, 2016. They will broadcast from the green garages located near the Point Reyes Lighthouse Visitor Center area. The modes of transmission to be used are single-sideband (SSB) voice, phase-shift keying (PSK) digital mode, and International Morse code. The first two are in use in commercial radio today while the code is still used by amateur radio operators but has dropped out of use with maritime, commercial and military communicators. Individuals with radios capable of only receiving AM and FM bandwidths will not be able to tune in to these shortwave radio broadcasts. The broadcasts will be transmitted over the following radio frequencies:  SSB: 14272, 7272 kHz CW: 14040 kHz  QSLs via W6AJF or N6KM w\/S.A.S.E. The Point Reyes Lighthouse was first illuminated on December 1, 1870. This treacherous point, once characterized as \"the worst the Pacific has to offer\" (SF Chronicle, 1870), was lit to guide mariners safely past Point Reyes. In 1870, as many as four men employed by the US Government's Lighthouse Board were stationed at Point Reyes. With the aid of lighthouse keepers, the Point Reyes Light Station remained in operation for 105 years. Today, the US Coast Guard maintains an automated light and fog signal while Point Reyes National Seashore staff serve as the modern day light keepers to the historic structure. Visitors to Point Reyes National Seashore can view the historic 1870 lens room with its intact first order Fresnel lens and clockwork mechanism. For the summer of 2016, the Point Reyes Lighthouse and Visitor Center are open Friday through Monday, 10 am to 4:30 pm, with the lens room open from 2:30 pm to 4 pm. Winds in excess of 40 mph will close the lighthouse stairs and cancel programs.
