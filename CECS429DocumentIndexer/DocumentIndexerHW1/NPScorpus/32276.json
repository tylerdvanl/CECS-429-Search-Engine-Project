    "body": "Environmental Leadership         Whitman Mission staff recycle as much as possible. In this photo, the administrative assistant recycles a toner cartridge. NPS photo  Whitman Mission National Historic Site has embraced the concepts of EMS (Environmental Management System) to holistically manage and operate our park to reduce our impacts on the environment. EMS has helped the park go beyond compliance with regulatory requirements to incorporate sustainable practices into our day-to-day practices. We practice continuous improvement, identifying and prioritizing activities and impacts, and developing actions to implement goals and targets. Monitoring and reviewing our EMS program, with support from our Superintendent, keeps us on track and aligned with our Commitment Statement. In particular, our achievements are helping reduce our carbon footprint, and, in our small way, we set an example in combating global climate change. Thinking globally and acting locally is practiced by park staff and is demonstrated by their actions and projects.",
