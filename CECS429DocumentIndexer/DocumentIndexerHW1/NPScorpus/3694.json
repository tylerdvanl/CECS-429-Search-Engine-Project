The raceways that were built in the late 18th- and early 19th-centuries, to take advantage of the nearby water power, were engineering marvels. A walk through Upper Raceway Park takes visitors along the beginning of the raceway system and past just a few of the many mills that benefitted from it.        Two of Paterson's mills along Spruce Street. The one on the right was part of the Rogers Locomotive Works complex and now houses the Paterson Musem. V.
