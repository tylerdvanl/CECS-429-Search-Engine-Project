    "body": "Savage River Campground       A Window to Denali  Savage River Campground is located at mile 13 on the Denali Park Road. It is the smallest of the three vehicle-accessible campgrounds in Denali, with 33 sites available for tent or RV campers. It is open mid-May through mid-September each year.  Access This campground is near the end of the paved, publicly-accessible portion of the Denali Park Road. You may drive a car or RV to and from the campground any time of the day or night when the campground is open.   If you do not have a vehicle, you may use a free bus called the Savage River Shuttle to travel between this campground and the park entrance. Sightseeing farther into the park, past Savage River, requires purchase of a shuttle bus ticket. A bus stop at the campground entrance is where you can wait for either of these types of buses.   Reservations You may make reservations online, through a third-party reservation system. Reservations are possible as early as December 1 of the summer before you wish to visit (e.g., Dec 1, 2015 for a 2016 visit).    Reservations are not always necessary, as the campground is not full every night of the summer. However, it does fill up on occasion, so reserving as early as you can is a good idea, if you are certain you wish to camp here.    Bus reservations are not required for the Savage River Shuttle, but are suggested for longer, sight-seeing shuttle bus trips into the park.        A typical view from near Savage River Campground NPS Photo       What to Expect in Savage  No campground in Denali has electrical or water hookups for RVs. Savage does have potable water, but no shower or laundry facilities.  Savage River Campground sits a few hundred feet below treeline, which is fairly low in Denali - about 3,000' above sea level for many areas. Sites are screened with brush in most cases.   An old gravel road leads through the campground towards Savage River itself, where the trees are less dense and beautiful, open views can be had. On clear days, Denali is visible from this area, a short walk from all the sites in Savage. Only two campgrounds in Denali boast such a view - Savage River and Wonder Lake.  The nearby Mountain Vista Rest Area and Savage Rest Area offer opportunities for hiking, scenic views, picnicing and more.   Small animals, such as red squirrels and snowshoe hare, are commonly seen in Savage. On occasion, a variety of birds will nest in the immediate area - great horned owls, merlins and ravens being some examples from recent years. Bear sightings are rare in Savage, but a few pass through the campground every summer. Read below for more wildlife safety information.  There is a maximum of eight people per site.      Group Camp Sites  There are three group camping sites in Savage. These are for parties of 9 to 20 people.
