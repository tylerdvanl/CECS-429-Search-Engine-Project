Teachers are required to attend a free instructional workshop prior to bringing their students on a program. At the workshop, teachers receive pre-visit and post-visit activities to be used in the classroom and learn how best to incorporate the park program into their classroom lesson plans. Park rangers lead the in-park programs, which generally last two hours. Group size is limited to 45-60 students and reservations are required.  Â      NPS Photo",
