    "body": "Field Trips     The undeveloped islands of Cape Lookout National Seashore offer pristine examples of barrier island ecology while the historic lighthouse and villages provide a glimpse into the lives of the people who have called these islands home. On your own or led by a ranger, field trips to the park can be an excellent way to connect classes to these subjects. However, the remote nature of the park means that class trips require advanced planning. More information can be found on the Plan a Field Trip, Ranger-led Educational Programs and Self-Guided Field Trip pages.

Students collect wind and ocean current data and model island roll over. Students also assess and analyze sea level rise engineering alternatives and beach replenishment projects for cost\/benefit and sustainability.

It takes special animals with special adaptations to live on the beach. During this 1-hour program, students learn about animal adaptations while they explore and look for evidence of creatures that live on or near the sandy shore. Students also play games and conduct activies that improve their understanding of weathering, erosion and deposition, predator-prey relationships and geography.

They can also take a hands-on look into the flora and fauna that have learned to survive in this harsh environment. This field trip guide includes science, math, and Social Studies pre, onsite, and post-visit activities.

The climb to the top of the Cape Lookout lighthouse can be used as part of a self-guided or ranger-guided fieldtrip. When used in support of an education curriculum, school groups may be eligible for an Academic Fee Waiver for lighthouse tickets.
