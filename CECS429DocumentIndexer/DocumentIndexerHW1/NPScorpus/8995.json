There are over 100 miles of hiking trails and many of them can be skied or snowshoed in the winter. The new Sleeping Bear Heritage Trail provides over 4 miles of paved trail for family and friends to ride bikes, walk, or ski. This trail will be groomed for cross-country skiing in the winter.   The 35 miles of mainland Lake Michigan beaches offer great swimming and sunbathing in the summer and incredible views for a quiet hike at any time of the year. Kayakers will find several good access points to Lake Michigan and for those who want to float the rivers, bring your boat or tube or rent them here and enjoy a leisurely float on the Platte or Crystal rivers. Hunters and fishermen will also find an abundance of opportunities. Use these pages to learn about the full range of outdoor activities available at the Lakeshore.",
