From the donor: \"This bench was chosen in loving memory of the beautiful life of Peggy Jin Chung Thrash (April 1977 - August 2013) who had resided in Great Falls for 20 years. This park held a special place in Peggy's heart throughout her life, and she shared her joy of this place with so many of her family and friends. We felt that it was most befitting we honor her in a way that encourages others to continue to appreciate the beautiful views of the park, as well as the beauty of life.\"  The Chung Family   These pages contain resources and information on ways you can help support your National Park.
