The Paseo del Morro once served as a maintenance road for the west section of the city walls. In 2001 it was designated as a National Recreation Trail. The trail skirts the city wall from the San Juan Gate to Castillo San Felipe del Morro along the entrance to the San Juan Bay.  Views across the bay, breezes from the Atlantic Ocean and views from the bottom of massive stone walls help to provide a historical experience unlike any other. Future plans include an entrance to the Paseo del Morro from Castillo San Felipe del Morro and a continuous trail to Castillo San Cristóbal as well.       An NPS Photo",
