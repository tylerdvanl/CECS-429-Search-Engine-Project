NATIONAL PARK SERVICE   Â    Camp JC Summer Camps The Jimmy Carter National Historic Site hosts two five day camps during the Summer months for those children in grades 3-7. Children have the opportunity to learn about what is takes and means to be a Park Ranger with the National Park Service. While learning, they also have some fun along the way. The camps focus on a variety of National Parks, Seashores, Monuments, Recreational Areas, and Historic Sites within the National Park Service. The Jimmy Carter National Historic Site offers interesting information about all these amazing places and also hopes to spark a lot of curiosity in kids to learn. A series of daily activities are offered in the areas of recreation, community service, science, history and art. The site will use these daily activities to emphasize: (1) places within the National Park Service, including the Jimmy Carter National Historic Site, (2) the many responsibilities of being a Park Ranger, and (3) the different ways to take good care of National Parks, nature and ourselves. Activities are held at the Plains High School and the Jimmy Carter Boyhood Farm.",
