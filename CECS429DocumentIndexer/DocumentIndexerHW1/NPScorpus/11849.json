The USC team, park staff, and volunteers from NPS, State Parks, and SMMC\/MRCA surveyed park visitors at 33 locations over two weekends and two days during the intervening week. Over 12,000 visitors were counted, and over 900 surveys were represented in the final data analysis. The survey gathered information on user demographics, recreational use patterns, attitudes toward protecting the national recreation area, attitudes toward other users, travel distance, and barriers to park access.
