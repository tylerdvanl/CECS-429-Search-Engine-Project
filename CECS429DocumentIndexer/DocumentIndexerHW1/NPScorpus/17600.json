    "body": "Negotiated Rulemaking for Dog Management       In 2006, a Negotiated Rulemaking Committee for Dog Management was appointed by the Secretary of the Interior, as part of the GGNRA planning process to determine how best to manage dog walking in the park. Committee members were selected to represent the diverse interests likely to be affected by a dog management plan. The Committee's charter was to develop consensus recommendations to the park about where it may be appropriate to allow dog walking in GGNRA managed lands. The full Committee held five public meetings; a Technical Subcommittee held nine meetings. The final meeting of the full Committee was on Saturday, October 27, 2007. Summaries of each of the full Committee meetings, the summary report on the GGNRA negotiated rulemaking process and additional background information can be found at the NPS Park Planning website, Negotiated Rulemaking for Dog Management in GGNRA under the Document List link.
