Used by permission.  Mammoth Cave National Park offers several opportunities for bicyclists to get out into the outdoors. Street bicycles are permitted on all paved Park roads that are open to the public, and mountain bikes are permitted on the unpaved administrative roads. In addition, certain trails have been specifically designed or designated for off-road bicycle use, and more are under development. The following special rules apply to bicycle users on Park trails:  Bicycles are prohibited on routes and trails not designated as open to bicycle use. Unless posted otherwise, bicycles may not be operated in excess of 15 miles per hour on designated routes. Bicyclists must yield the right of way to horses and hikers on all shared trails.
