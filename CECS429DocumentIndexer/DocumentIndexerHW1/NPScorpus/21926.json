Thank you to those who have donated items in support of the monument! These are some of our donors and their contributions.  Â       Mr. Andy Straub   One of the newest donations to the museum collection at WWII Valor in the Pacific National Monument is from Mr. Andy Straub. He was the son of a Navy veteran, Arthur F. Straub, who worked on the salvaging of the Pacific Fleet after the attack on Pearl Harbor. That effort is considered by many historians as one of the greatest salvage operations in history.   Mr. Straub was here to visit the USS Arizona Memorial and to donate his father's ID tag that he wore during his naval service here at Pearl Harbor during World War II. Recently, Marie McCarthy (his granddaughter) and Jamie (his great-granddaughter) came to the Pearl Harbor Visitor Center to see the USS Arizona Memorial and view the ID tag. This unique identification artifact designated that Mr. Straub was attached to the Navy Yard Pearl Harbor, Ship Repair Unit.",
