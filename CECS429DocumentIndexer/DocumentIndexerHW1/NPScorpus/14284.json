The once abundant wild irises nearly disappeared but are now making a comeback; find out why below.       South Louisiana's long growing season and abundant rain means it's a great place to be a plant. The Barataria Preserve contains three major plant systems: hardwood forest, swamp, and marsh, and is a good place to see over 400 species of plants.  In the spring, the wildflowers fill every corner of the Barataria Preserve, although the giant blue iris population was greatly reduced for several years (find out why here and read about their comeback). The freshwater marsh turns bright green in the summertime, forming a complex system of reeds, sedges, grasses, and shrubs. Fall in the preserve brings the bright crimson of swamp (red) maples and the brilliant yellow of burmarigolds. Even in the winter, many plants stay green.
