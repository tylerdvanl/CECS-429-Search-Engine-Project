    "body": "Visitor and Resource Protection       \"...to promote and regulate the use of the...national parks...which purpose is to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wildlife therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\" - National Park Service Organic Act, 16 U.S.C. 1 As outlined in the Organic Act of 1916, protecting our visitors and our cultural and natural resources are the heart of the National Park Service. Protecting these resources are the mission of the Visitor and Resource Protection program at Monocacy National Battlefield. Visitor and Resource Protection staff perform a wide variety of functions, including:  enforcing existing wildlife, fishing, traffic, and other laws within the park's boundary;  protecting and preserving cultural and natural resources;  managing the park's structural and wildland fire protection and prevention programs;  providing emergency medical services;  responding to and managing developing emergencies; and  providing the high level of \"on-the-ground\" customer service that has long been the tradition of park rangers.  Monocacy National Battlefield Visitor and Resource Protection personnel also provide assistance to other park units and government agencies as needed.  They provide CPR and first aid training for other employees, and work closely with Natural and Cultural Resource Management to provide archeological site patrols, resource damage protection, wildlife monitoring, and wildlife population density surveys.",
