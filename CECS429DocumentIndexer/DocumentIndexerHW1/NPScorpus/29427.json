Just for starters, you can become a Junior Ranger or take a turn playing historic games during one of the many special weekends this national park hosts throughout the year. NEW! Check out our Park Fun page! We've just posted a famous ghost story about St. Paul's Church. And keep checking in with us, as over the next year we plan to post more \"kid-only\" activities from coloring pages to more stories.",
