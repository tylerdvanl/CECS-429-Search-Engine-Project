Bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nest near the park and can often be seen in flight or perching along the Lewis and Clark River. As a result of protection and the banning of DDT, these formerly endangered birds are making a strong comeback along the northern Oregon coast. Osprey (Pandion haliaetus), hawks, herons, migrating shorebirds, and wintering waterfowl also frequent the park's wetlands. Band-tailed pigeons (Patagioenas fasciata) and olive-sided flycatchers (Contopus borealis), two federal species of concern, seasonally inhabit the park's coniferous forests along with resident pileated woodpeckers (Dryocopus pileatus), and several owl species.
