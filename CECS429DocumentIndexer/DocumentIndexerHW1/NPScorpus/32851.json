A new printable 2008 Accessibility Guide  (PDF 668 KB) has been completed for your information.  The guide linked below highlights accessible facilities and upgrades. Please see our Accessibility Index for specifics about each park facility.  Accessible restrooms are available at all visitor information stations and most campgrounds. The North Cascades Visitor Center, Sedro-Woolley information station, and Wilderness Information Office are fully accessible. The approach to the Golden West Visitor Center is an unpaved, sloping path which can be negotiated with assistance. There is a ramp into the center and an elevator inside.   The Sterling Munro Trail at the North Cascades Visitor Center and the Happy Creek Forest Walk at milepost 135 on S.R.20 are fully accessible boardwalk paths. Happy Creek is a 1\/3 mile (1\/2 kilometer) loop through ancient forest.
