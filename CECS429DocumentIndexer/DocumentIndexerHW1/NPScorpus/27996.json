The Obed Wild and Scenic River is a magnificent park to photograph, as the following pages will attest. In this photo gallery, you will find examples of recreational activities such as kayaking and rock climbing. Not to be outdone, you will also view beautiful scenery from places like the Lilly Bluff Overlook and the rushing rapids along the Nemo-Emory River confluence. Because the Obed is \"Wild and Scenic,\" our various forms of wildlife will also be on display in these pages. Special zoom controls will enable you to take a closer look at the specific elements in all of our photos. You can also view a slideshow of the photos. We encourage you to take the time to look at some of these photos, and we challenge you to take some of your own when you visit us!
