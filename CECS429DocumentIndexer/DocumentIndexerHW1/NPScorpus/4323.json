The fact that most of the park is covered by water means that many visitors will have transportation and logistical issues to deal with. Visitors with their own boats can easily get themselves into costly and dangerous situations without adequate planning. We encourage you to explore this website thoroughly to learn about the best times of year for the activities you are most interested in. Doing so will help you avoid common disappointments such as those experienced by those who want to snorkel in January or camp in July.",
