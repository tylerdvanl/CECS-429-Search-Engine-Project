    "body": "Winter Activities: Cross-Country Skiing and Snowshoeing       Winter activities such as cross-country (nordic) skiing and snowshoeing at Mesa Verde can be a very peaceful experience. Many times you may be the only person around. Because most of the trees are bare, wildlife is more visible in the winter. You may even be able to find their tracks in the snow. Winter trails will be available once there is an appreciable amount of snow and the park has begun to groom the trails for snowshoeing and cross-country skiing. (Please check the park's Hiking page for trails that are available before the snow falls and the winter trails are open.) For winter trails updates:  Visit the Winter Trails Condition Report Page Call the Chief Ranger's Office (Monday to Friday, 8:00 am to 4:00 pm) 970-529-4622 Call the Chapin Mesa Archeological Museum (7 days a week, 9:00 am to 4:30 pm) 970-529-4631   When engaging in winter activities follow these safety guidelines to ensure a great experience:  Bring adequate gear, food and water. Sign in at the Trail Register so rangers will know you are out there. Stay on marked trails so you do not get lost.
