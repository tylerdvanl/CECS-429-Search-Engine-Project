The Wagner Perspective  There are a number of ways to enjoy the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail, including auto-touring, visiting interpretive sites, hiking, camping, biking or horseback riding along trail segments, and visiting museums and interpretive centers. Depending on which segment you would like to explore, some or all of these activities may be available. Although the word \"trail\" is used in the name, the Mormon Pioneer NHT is not necessarily a hiking trail. With 1,300 miles of the original route now in the hands of various private and public entities, access to trail segments depends upon the permission of the land owner. Some segments are open to the public for hiking and other means of recreation, while others are not.",
