    "body": "John Roebling       A German immigrant, and graduate of the Royal Polytechnic School of Berlin, Roebling came to the United States in 1831. It was not until 1845 that he built his first suspension structure. From 1845 until his death in 1869, he designed five major suspension bridges. Two — the Cincinnati-Covington Bridge and the Brooklyn Bridge — are still standing. John Roebling designed four suspension aqueducts for the D & H Canal: the Lackawaxen and Delaware Aqueducts, the Neversink Aqueduct (Neversink Valley Area Museum in Cuddebackville, NY), and the High Falls Aqueduct (D & H Canal Historical Society and Museum in High Falls, NY). After the canal closed in 1898, three were abandoned. The Delaware Aqueduct's strategic location and value as a road bridge prevented its demolition.
