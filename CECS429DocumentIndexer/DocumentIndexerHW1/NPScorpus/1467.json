Since 1821, traders on the Santa Fe Trail had brought their goods by steamboat as far up the Missouri River as possible before departing on foot and wagon for Santa Fe. Landings continued to move farther and farther west along the river and by the late 1830s Santa Fe traders disembarked here at Westport Landing â€“ just before the river's northward bend.
