There are a handful of privately owned and operated lodges in the park, as well as a wide range of accommodations outside of the park. Most area businesses are open in summer only (roughly mid-May through mid-September), though some businesses nearby stay open year-round. Learn more about lodging in and around Denali.   Camping  Denali has six campgrounds, three of which are open to tent or vehicle camping (RVs, etc) and three of which can only be used by tent campers. Most are open May 20 - mid-September, though Riley Creek is open year-round. Learn more about campgrounds in Denali.  In addition, visitors may backpack nearly anywhere in Denali's six million acres.

The main summer season runs from June through August. Businesses open at different times each year, so prepare for limited services if you visit in May or September.   Located next to the Denali Visitor Center, the Morino Grill is the only sit-down restaurant in the park. Snacks can be purchased at the Wilderness Access Center and snacks, sandwiches and camping food can be purchased at the Mercantile in Riley Creek Campground.  There are picnic tables at Mountain Vista and Savage River, miles 13.5 and 15, respectively. There are also picnic tables outside the Denali Visitor Center.
