NPS\/NOCA\/David Snyder  Tune in - Help us safeguard the sounds of life There is a whole new world of sound waiting to be revealed. Here are some tips to help you become attentive listeners in national parks.    Take a moment to close your eyes and listen to the sounds around you. You may be surprised by what you hear. Speak quietly and turn off vehicle engines whenever possible. Look for mute options on electronic equipment such as cell phones, watches, or cameras. Follow park rules on motorized recreation, and be courteous and respectful on your motorcycle or boat. Turn off car alarms. Disable sound on electronic door locks. Use alternative transportation such as shuttles when available.   Be aware of campground quiet hours. Be respectful of others. The sounds you make will affect the experience of other visitors. Encourage friends and family to do the same.",
