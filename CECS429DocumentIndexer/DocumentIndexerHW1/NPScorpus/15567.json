There are many Places to Go and Things to Do, including learning history, exploring historic sites and hiking scenic trails. Each site is independently operated. Hours, fees, and use rules vary. Contact individual sites for details.  The Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail has three central components that link together history, culture, and outdoor recreation in Arizona and California:   Historic Route The Anza Trail's Historic Route is the wide corridor traveled by the colonists and livestock of the Anza Expedition of 1775-76. Expedition diarists mapped and recorded their route and campsites.   Auto Tour Route An Auto Tour follows the historic route as closely as possible. Drivers can follow Auto Tour signage to experience the sites and vistas encountered by the Anza Expedition (Auto Tour signage not yet posted in Arizona).   Recreation Trail A long-term goal for the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail is a continuous, 1,200-mile, non-motorized recreation trail from Nogales, AZ, to the San Francisco Bay Area. This trail will be created by stitching together existing trails that have been certified official recreation segments of the Anza Trail. Nearly 300 miles of recreation trail have been certified.   Explore an interactive map of the Anza Trail's Historic Route, Auto Route, and Recreation Trail at http:\/\/www.anzahistorictrail.org.           The historic Martinez Adobe at the John Muir National Historic Site.
