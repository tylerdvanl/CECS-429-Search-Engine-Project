Please visit the Lower River cam on explore.org for more reliable access.      Location: Lower River Wildlife Viewing Platform at Brooks Camp.  When to Watch: July and September-October are the best time to watch bears fishing in the lower Brooks River. However, bears are in the area from mid spring until late fall. Katmai’s brown bears are most active during daylight hours.  What to Look For: From late June until mid July, watch for bears to actively chase schools of migrating salmon through the river. Later in the summer and fall, many bears can be seen patrolling this area for dead and dying salmon. In July, some female bears with cubs prefer to fish here instead of Brooks Falls.  If you desire a more interactive experience, please head on over to our webcam partner's website, explore.org. They have all of the cams, plus chat and social media connections, and be sure to download the eBooks on Katmai’s bears. These books are free and have lots of photos of the bears, their life histories, videos, and maps. Questions? Browse the Bearcam Frequently Asked Questions.
