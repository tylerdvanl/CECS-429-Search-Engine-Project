The primary purpose of the VIP program is to provide a vehicle through which the National Park Service can accept and utilize voluntary help and services from the public. The major objective of the program is to utilize this voluntary help in such a way that is mutually beneficial to the National Park Service and the volunteer. Volunteers are accepted from the public without regard to race, creed, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, or disability. Parks may accept donations from individuals, families, organizations, foundations, corporations, businesses, associations and other entities. Your contribution will be used to enhance visitor services and support resource protection and programs throughout the park. No other federal agency relies as heavily on the generosity and kindness of its visitors, and we thank you for your past support and look forward to future cooperation. The park is able to accept direct donations. If you are interested in donating, you may contact the park by phone (202) 426-5961. Please make checks out to the National Park Service. Donations may be mailed to: Site Manager Fort Dupont 1900 Anacostia Drive, SE Washington, DC 20020 To donate to any of your national parks, you can contact the National Park Foundation. www.nationalparks.org",
