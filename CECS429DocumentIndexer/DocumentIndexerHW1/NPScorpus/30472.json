    "body": "Hiking       Over 125 miles of hiking trails are available for your hiking pleasure in CVNP. These trails range from nearly level to challenging, and pass through various habitats including woodlands, wetlands, and old fields. Some trails require you to cross streams with stepping stones or log bridges, while others, including the Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath Trail, are nearly level and are accessible to all visitors. Descriptions of some easy family hikes are provided here. A portion of Ohio's Buckeye Trail also passes through the park.   Trail maps showing the park's hiking trails are available at most visitor centers or by clicking the maps webpage link below. Several books, leaflets, and maps, including the Trail Guide Handbook: Cuyahoga Valley National Park, 3rd Edition, contain helpful information about hiking opportunities and locations in the park. This book is published by the Cuyahoga Valley Trails Council and is available for sale at all CVNP visitor centers. It is the source of most of the following trail information.
