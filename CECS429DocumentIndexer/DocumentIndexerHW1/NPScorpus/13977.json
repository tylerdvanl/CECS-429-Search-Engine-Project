The Final General Management Plan analyzes the impacts associated with four alternative approaches to managing the park, including the agency preferred alternative. The final plan contains the alternatives and analyses published in the January 2003 Supplemental Draft General Management Plan, as well as responses to all sustentative public comments received during the public review period. These comments have been responded to by modifying the alternatives, clarifying or updating the analyses, making factual revisions, or explaining why a comment does not warrant further action.
