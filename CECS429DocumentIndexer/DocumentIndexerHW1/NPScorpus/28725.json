A group of over 500 volunteers under the guidance of tree-planting experts and professional landscapers planted nearly 15,000 seedlings -- a mixture of a native conifer and deciduous species. The reforestation effort, part of the memorial's overall design landscape, will ultimately include approximately 150,000 trees.           Penn State Altoona - Planting Trees for Flight 93 Students and faculty from the Environmental Studies and Honors programs at Penn State Altoona, joined other volunteers in helping plant trees at the memorial. These students, faculty, and Joe Pizarchik, director of the U.S. Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and former Penn State Altoona student, discuss their experience.           Working for the Warblers Learn how reestablishing native forests at the memorial benefits migratory bird species, including the golden-winged warbler.",
