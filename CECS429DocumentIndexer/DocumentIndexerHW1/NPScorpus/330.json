The program consists of a Junior Ranger booklet specifically created to help children 8-12 years of age to learn more about the Riverway. The booklet has a number of activities, at least ten of them must be completed to be awarded the status of a Junior Ranger.  The Junior Ranger booklet can be downloaded and printed (the booklet is 28 pages and 6.07 MB) or acquired at one of the Visitor Centers.  After at least ten of the activities are completed, family members can stop by the Riverway's Visitor Centers in either Trego or St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin to get their award.
