    "body": "CESI Modeling Projects by Title          These projects support the development and refinement of predictive models that simulate physical and biological responses to proposed modifications. Simulation Modeling projects use data from Baseline Research and Long-term Monitoring projects to parameterize models. Projects below can be sorted according to year, project title or principal investigator. Where available, click on project titles for more in-depth project information.
