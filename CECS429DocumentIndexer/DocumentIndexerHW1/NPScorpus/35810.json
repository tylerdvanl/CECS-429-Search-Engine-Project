    "body": "Be A Junior Ranger         Junior Ranger Patch NPS  Junior Ranger programs engage young people in age-appropriate activities that allow them to discover the significance of a specific site, introduce them to the national park system and to the mission of the National Park Service. They reveal to children that these amazing places belong to them. Junior Ranger programs are designed to provide participants with the flexibility to discover and interact with the park at their own pace and within the limits of their visit. They encourage children and their families to explore things they might otherwise have missed, to get out and walk around, to explore further by visiting specialized programs, park movies, exhibits, trails overlooks, talking to a ranger, and others. When you get to the park visitor center ask a park ranger or volunteer for a junior ranger booklet if you are between the ages of 6-12 and you can fill it out and earn a badge!   Here is the Jr. Ranger Booklet that you can download now!",
