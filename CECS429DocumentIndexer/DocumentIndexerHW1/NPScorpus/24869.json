To give directly to Aleutian, please mail your check to:  Superintendent, Alaska Affiliated Areas 240 West 5th Avenue Anchorage, AK 99501  The advantage of making your donation to Alaska Geographic is that the amount will be deposited in an interest-bearing account to assist projects or programs as requested and prioritized by Aleutian's managers.
