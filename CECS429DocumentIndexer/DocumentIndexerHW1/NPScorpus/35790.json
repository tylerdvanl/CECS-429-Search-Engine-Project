The trail is suitable for lovers of history, nature as well as people just wishing to exercise. The trail encompasses areas where both the union and confederate armies were during the time the fighting at the Battle of Appomattox Court House stopped leading to the surrender of Confederate General Robert E. Lee to Union General Ulysses S. Grant. Also, the Sweeney Prizery which is the oldest building on park grounds is located a half mile down the trail from Lee's Headquarters.

If you are a trail runner, the park offers fun runs. Distances vary but the average distance is three miles. All ages and abilities are welcome. Also the park offers nature walks which take place on one of the loop trails. Schedules and times for these events vary from month to month. &",
