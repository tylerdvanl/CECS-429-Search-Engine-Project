The Common carp is the most common species in the Arkansas River. - Thursday, August 26, 1846, Report of Lt. J. W. Abert of his Examination of New Mexico - \"The men in their leisure moments amused themselves with fishing.  Cat fish and hickory shad are the only kinds I have ever seen in these waters; and we found them very palatable, although they may not be compared with the white fish of Lake Superior or the rock fish of the Potomac.\"",
