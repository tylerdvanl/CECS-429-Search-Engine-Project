Â      The rustic Carver Nature Trail offers a canopy of different native Missouri trees with lush ground cover.   Be sure to plan at least one hour for an easy hike. The one-mile, self-guiding loop leads you into woodlands, across streams, and along a tallgrass prairie restoration area. You can see the Boy Carver statue, the 1881 Moses Carver house, and visit the Carver Family Cemetery. (George Washington Carver is buried at Tuskegee University in Alabama.) One can clearly capture the same enthusiasm young George showed for all of nature.
