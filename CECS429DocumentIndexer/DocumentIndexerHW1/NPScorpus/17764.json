Alcatraz has a fee for the ferry. NPS         Entrance Fees   The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA), authorizes Recreation Fees to be charged within the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Eighty percent of the money is retained in the park and makes possible important visitor service and resource protection projects. Without you, the visitor, these improvements would not be possible. All FLREA passes are issued and accepted at Muir Woods National Monument. Please note, these passes do not apply at Alcatraz Island, which does not charge an entrance fee.
