During the summer season visitors should dress in light, comfortable clothing, wear comfortable shoes and use sunscreen. High temperatures and high humidity create higher risk of heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heatstroke.  During the fall visitors should have a light jacket available as temperatures can drop suddenly.  Winter temperatures can be unpredictable, ranging from mild to extremely cold.
