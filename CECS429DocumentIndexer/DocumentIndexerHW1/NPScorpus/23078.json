In the absence of predators such as the sea otter, kelp forests can be decimated by grazers such as sea urchins. With the return of the sea otter to Glacier Bay, the kelp forests have returned. A wide variety of living creatures could not survive in the urchin barrens but thrive in the kelp forests. Guiding Question: What is kelp and why is it important to biodiversity in Glacier Bay?    Critical Content Students will know ...  The anatomy of kelp The meaning of protist and how a protist compares to a plant The physiological adaptations that allow kelp to thrive in Glacier Bay's marine environment The relationship between sea urchins, kelp and sea otters The ecological importance of kelp to marine communities     Skill Objectives Students will be able to ...  Compare a protist and a plant using classroom models. Use Venn Diagrams to determine if a organism is a protist or a plant. Compare temperate rainforests to kelp forests. Create a mural to compare the biodiversity of a kelp forest to that of a temperate rainforest. Use comparisons to prove the importance of kelp forests to the planet. Determine the impact of protections to Glacier Bay on the development of kelp forest habitat. Take a stand and debate others on the economic development of kelp forests such as those protected in Glacier Bay. Write a news article expressing their stand on the economic development of kelp and its possible effect on government protections as exemplified in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve.
