    "body": "Explore This Park    Learn About the Park     Nature     Animals     Fish                Fish          The battlefield has several freshwater resources within its boundaries. The major water body is the Monocacy River which runs right through the center of the park. Bush Creek and several other streams empty into the Monocacy river providing a network of waterways. In addition to the streams, the park has a pond located next to the visitor center. During the summer of 2003, Frostburg State University conducted a sampling of fish species within the park and looked at species richness and diversity. Thirty-six species were found within the sites evaluated. Because the park has diverse freshwater resources, the park can support fish populations that have different habitat specifications. Species such as the Greenside Darter prefer the swift moving currents of the Monocacy River; while other species such as the Common Carp, prefer the tranquility of the pond.",
