    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility             Accessibility       Accessibility for visitors with disabilities: Moores Creek National Battlefield has installed equipment that is able to provide audio descriptions of our interpretive video, \"In the Most Furious Manner\", for those visitors who are visually impaired. For the hearing impaired, closed-captioning of the script continuously narrates the movie as the story-line rolls. The video is shown in the Visitor Center's auditorium. Included in the park's boundaries are two interpretive trails totaling one mile in length. These trails are wheel-chair accessible, and they allow for easy access for visitors with physical disabilities.  Benches are established along the trails to allow for resting and enjoyment of the surrounding environment.",
