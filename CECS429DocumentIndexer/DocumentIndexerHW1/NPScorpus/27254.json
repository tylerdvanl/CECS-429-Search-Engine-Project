You can make sure that your visit is a safe and pleasant one by following a few safety guidelines:   If something seems dangerous, don't do it! People are injured every year in national parks by doing things such as crossing a stream improperly or straying off of marked trails. If you have a bad feeling about a situation, it is best to always play it safe. Do not be afraid to say something if you see somebody else being unsafe. If you feel uncomfortable, find a park ranger and let them know so that they can notify the proper people to handle a situation. Know before you arrive what you need to have a safe hiking trip or outing on the water. If you seem something that could be a potential safety hazard, let park staff know so that they can take care of it as soon as possible. This helps park staff keep other visitors safe from harm. If you get lost, stay in one place! This will prevent you from getting lost even further, and helps rescuers reach you quicker. If there is an emergency, call 9-1-1. Cell service can be unreliable in the park, so you may have to find a place where there is reception, or send someone with a cell phone to make the call. Calling 9-1-1 helps emergency responders to get your exact location and arrive sooner.   Remember, your safety is always in your hands.",
