    "body": "Distance Learning           Witness to History Videoconference Program Witness to History programs utilize videoconferencing technology to take students where visitors cannot go, bringing the sites and stories of Pearl Harbor to students unable to visit Hawaii.  The Pearl Harbor Survivor Series enables Pearl Harbor Survivors to relate their testimonies of that fateful day to schools and other interested groups. (Click link for selected biographies.) The Interpretive Ranger Series shows a video of a USS Arizona underwater dive while the Park Ranger gives a voice-over interpretive lesson. This is followed by a student and educator question and answer time.  At this time, we are revamping the Video Teleconference Program and will not be taking any requests. Please e-mail us for updates.         Stay tuned for new and exciting distance learning opportunities at the Memorial in the near future.           Results  There are no results to show.",
