The Monument is home to over 100 species of birds which live in the tallgrass prairie and woodland. Trails meander through both of these habitats, giving visitors many opportunities for bird-watching. Mammals such as white-tailed deer, beaver, rabbit, squirrel, and coyote can also be seen, as well as amphibians and fish. Many of these animals rely on the wide variety of insects present on the prairie. Insects are a food source for songbirds and reptiles, and they are vital in the pollination of wildflowers.",
