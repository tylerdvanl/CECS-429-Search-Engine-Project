Â   Whirling DiseaseThis disease, now expanding into Utah and northern Nevada, causes fish to be deformed and swim in tight circles, hence the name.  Currently, whirling disease is not present in Great Basin National Park, so please help us keep it out!Moving live fish between bodies of water is prohibited in the park.  Doing so can aid in the spread of disease.Thoroughly wash all waders and other gear before entering a different creek or body of water. If you have previously fished in an area that contains whirling disease, clean your gear, including boots and waders, with a 10% bleach solution.  Let them dry in the sun to kill any spores before fishing in the park.",
