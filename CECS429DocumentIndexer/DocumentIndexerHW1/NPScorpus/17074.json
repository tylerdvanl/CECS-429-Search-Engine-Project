Park visitors bringing service animals to Castle Mountains are reminded that the desert environment poses certain challenges for working animals. Bringing plenty of extra water and a bowl is important. Booties can protect a dog's feet from scorching temperatures and jagged rocks, though they should not be worn for extended periods of time. A desert first aid kit for your service animal should include:  tweezers or small pliers (important for cactus spine removal) contact info for your veterinarian gauze vet wrap antibiotic wipes or alcohol pads (for cleaning wounds in the field) styptic swabs (useful for stopping bleeding of torn nails) latex or nitrile glove (can do double-duty as a temporary dog bootie)  There are no plastic bags provided for animal waste, so please bring your own and clean up after your service animal.",
