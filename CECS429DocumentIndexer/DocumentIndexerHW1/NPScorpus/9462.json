The Friends of Still Creek participated in the Potomac Watershed Cleanup focusing on Still Creek, enjoyed a watershed walk in Greenbelt Park, discovered Still Creek Watershed in a driving tour, and explored the fishes of Still creek on a electro-fishing presentation on the fishes of Still Creek. The mission of Friends of Still Creek is to care for and protect the stream that flows through the heart of Greenbelt National Park. Still Creek, fed by waters beginning outside the park on the lands where we live and work, is affected by our every action. With this in mind, we seek to understand how people treat these lands and in turn, create ways to involve the broader community in restoring the ecological health of the watershed. We envision a stream system that is clean, attractive and teeming with life and we are committed to making this a reality.",
