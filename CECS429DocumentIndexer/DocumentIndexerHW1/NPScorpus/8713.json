Reducing Your Carbon Footprint  This on-line program empowers visitors to reduce their carbon emissions and thereby help to protect America's national parks from the impacts of climate change.  Do Your Part! for Climate Friendly Parks works by creating a greenhouse gas (GHG) profile linked to the carbon footprint a selected park. Participants calculate their carbon footprint by entering basic information about their household's energy needs. The website offers specific GHG reduction recommendations, such as how to invest in energy efficient appliances or how to improve recycling practices that will reduce their GHG emissions. After six months, participants are asked to return to the website to update the progress they have made toward reducing their carbon footprint.",
