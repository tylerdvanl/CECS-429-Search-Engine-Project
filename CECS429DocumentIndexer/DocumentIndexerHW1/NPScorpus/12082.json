You may hear it foraging in chaparral or leaf litter and perhaps expect a California Towhee but the thrasher’s black bill is long and down-curved. An expert mimic, the California Thrasher has been known to imitate Northern Flicker, House Finch, and American Robin.   Diet: Insects, seeds, small fruits   Wingspan: 12.5” Length: 12”  Did you know? Like a chaparral version of the American Avocet, thrashers swipe their long bills sideways to stir up food.",
