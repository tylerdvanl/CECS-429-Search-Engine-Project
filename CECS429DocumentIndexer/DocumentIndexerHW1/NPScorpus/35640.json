The Advance Lottery: 3 months prior The Advance Lottery is for trips through The Subway and Mystery Canyon. Due to the popularity of these two areas, the park created an online lottery for reservations. The Advance Lottery does not run from November through March due to a low demand for permits.  Advance Lottery applications are completed online. Entries must be submitted three months prior to your planned trip. Entries are limited to one request per individual per month. Entrants can request three prioritized dates. The non-refundable lottery application is $5.00.  Applicants will be sent a notification email on the fifth day of the following month with information about the status of their request. If a reservation is awarded, the permit must be obtained before the trip at a park visitor center. If there are spaces remaining after the lottery has run, they will become available through the advanced reservation system. Apply for the Advance Lottery for The Subway and Mystery Canyon. The Last Minute Drawing: 7 to 2 days in advance The remaining permits can be obtained through the Last Minute Drawing, 7-2 days before your trip date. In the small chance the Last Minute Drawing does not fill, walk-in permits become available the day before or the day of your trip date at park visitor centers. Apply for the Last Minute Drawing for canyoneering day trips. Hours of Operation   Zion Express Membership If you are a frequent visitor to Zion, consider enrolling in the Zion Express Membership.
