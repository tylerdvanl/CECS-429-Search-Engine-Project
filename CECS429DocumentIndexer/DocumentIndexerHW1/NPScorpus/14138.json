When the mission was reestablished in August 1722, Father Antonio Margil de Jesús moved it east of the previous site—near a stream and a large tract of level land that could be used for cultivation. Recent archeological research located the site on a hill next to Ayish Bayou within the present city limits of San Augustine. Investigations have revealed everyday life at Mission Dolores. Cow and ox bones, common in the excavated trash pits, give clues on butchering techniques and preferred cuts of meat. Gun flints, broken knife blades, and horse trappings were probably associated with the soldier guards living at the mission. Pieces of broken Indian-made pottery are plentiful. It would appear that the inhabitants relied heavily on locally made utensils. The property is on the National Register of Historic Places and is a state historic landmark.
