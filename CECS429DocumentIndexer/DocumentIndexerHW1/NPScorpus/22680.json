    "body": "Deep, Steep and Narrow  Big enough to be overwhelming, still intimate enough to feel the pulse of time, Black Canyon of the Gunnison exposes you to some of the steepest cliffs, oldest rock, and craggiest spires in North America. With two million years to work, the Gunnison River, along with the forces of weathering, has sculpted this vertical wilderness of rock, water, and sky.                Things To Do   Explore the many activities that are possible in the park.        Camping   Decide which campground is right for you whether you're driving and rv or pitching a tent.              Hiking Along the Rim   Trails for all abilities are available on both South and North Rims.        Routes to the River   Extremely strenuous hikes to the bottom of the canyon in steep, unmaintained and unmarked gullies.        Calendar of Events   Join us for a ranger-guided program.",
