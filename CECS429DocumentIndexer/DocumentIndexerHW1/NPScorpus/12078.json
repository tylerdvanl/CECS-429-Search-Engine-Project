Pinnacles offers solitude, challenge, and escape from the urban interface of both the San Francisco and Monterey Bay areas. Unlike many national parks, Pinnacles is most popular in the cooler months. During the spring, when the grasses are green and a variety of wildflowers can be seen along any trail, hiking is at its best. Fall and winter are also excellent times to visit. During the summer, extreme temperatures can make hiking uncomfortable at best, and possibly dangerous for those who are unprepared. If you plan to visit Pinnacles from late May through early September, please check the weather forecast and plan accordingly.  Basic Information Directions & Transportation Eating and Sleeping Things to do Calendar Safety Accessibility Current Conditions    We recommend hikers consume at least one liter of water \/ hour while hiking under any weather conditions.        For Pinnacles weather information, including up-to-the-minute conditions, visit here.        For more trip planning tips for Pinnacles and the surrounding area visit our park partner Pinnacles Partnership.",
