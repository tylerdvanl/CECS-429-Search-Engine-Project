Most of our visitation happens between December and March. Consistent winter rains will produce gorgeous spring wildflowers. Early summer days are hot and dry with temperatures in the 100's and humidity below 10%. Late summer monsoons bring fantastic lighting and furious thunderstorms. Temperatures drop to 90s, however the humidity increases. Plan on getting up early and taking an afternoon siesta in the shade if you plan to visit us in the summertime. Dress for the Weather  A wide-brimmed hat, comfortable clothing, and sturdy walking shoes or boots are necessary for anyone planning to hike. Sunscreen is a must. Hikers must always carry plenty of water. One gallon per person per day is recommended.      Temperature and Rainfall Chart For Organ Pipe            Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec     Average Max °F   72   72   77   85   95   102   103   102   99   87   75   68     Average Min °F   42   42   46   52   60   70   75   74   68   57   46   39     Average Days Over 100°F   0   0   0   0   8   20   25   22   16   1   0   0     Average Rainfall\/(in)   0.92   0.64   0.89   0.47   0.01   0.38   0.98   1.41   0.65   0.58   0.27   0.52",
