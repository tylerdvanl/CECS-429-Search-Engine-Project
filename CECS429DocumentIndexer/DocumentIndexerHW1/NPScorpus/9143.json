NPS Photo     There are a number of places in the park which, when the weather cooperates, afford good skiing for the beginner and intermediate. Catoctin Mountain has snow conditions that are often significantly different from conditions in the nearby metropolitan areas. Conditions change quickly, so skiers are advised to phone (301) 663-9388, or to stop at the Visitor Center before embarking on a ski adventure. Generally, the best skiing is along certain sections of park roads which are closed to vehicular traffic. Three to four inches of snow are needed to provide a good base. Most of the park trails are narrow, steep and rocky; but a few sections offer fair possibilities for good skiers. A minimum of six to eight inches of snow is needed for safe trail skiing. All trails are designated as foot trails, not ski trails. Use care: You are the best judge of snow conditions and of your ability.   Neither roads nor trails are groomed or broken by machines.  Ski Rentals: Equipment is available for rent in Frederick, Hagerstown and other large cities. Check in the yellow page listings for specialty shops, sporting goods, and outdoor shops. There are no equipment rentals in Catoctin Mountain Park or in Thurmont, MD.",
