    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Safety            Safety        (National Park Service)   Â    The old scout motto \"Be Prepared!\" applies to a visit to one of your national parks and Gettysburg is no exception. Good planning and preparation will make your visit enjoyable and rewarding. Summer months can be extremely hot and humid, with occasional severe thunderstorms. Fall and spring are pleasant with cool temperatures and brisk winds. Winter weather occasionally forces the closure of some park roads and buildings depending on severity. Sensible seasonal dress is recommended for your visit and depending on your planned activities, should include accessories such as sunscreen, hiking boots, and extra water. When hiking or biking in the park, make certain you have adequate water and a fully charged cell phone to use in case of an emergency. All emergencies in the park should be addressed to 911. Avoid Ticks! Be mindful while walking through tall grass and brush in natural and agricultural areas of the park due to the number of ticks common, some of which carry disease such as Lyme Disease, which can be transmitted to humans after contact with an infected deer tick, a small species of tick common in Pennsylvania. Visitors who prefer to walk in such areas should be aware of this danger, use proper insect repellent, and be certain to examine their clothing for these parasites. For your safety we recommend that visitors stay on walking trails and paths. Avoid Ticks Informational Page. Poisonous plants and encounters with wildlife are not uncommon on the battlefield, and visitors should be aware of possible hazards while exploring the park on foot or by vehicle. Firearms in National Parks: Federal law governing possession of firearms inside a national park changed on February 22, 2010. Visitors may possess firearms within a national park unit provided they comply with federal, state, and local laws. The role of the responsible gun owner is to know and obey the federal, state, and local laws appropriate to the park they are visiting. Please remember that federal law prohibits firearms in certain park facilities and buildings. These places are marked with signs at public entrances.
