    "body": "Newspaper Interviews          Isaac C. Parker was interviewed on two occasions by reporters for St. Louis newspapers. The first time was in 1875, shortly after his arrival in Fort Smith. He discusses the Federal Court for the Western District of Arkansas's unique jurisdiction and current opinion on a railroad line through Arkansas and Indian Territory. Parker's last interview, two months before his death, was in September, 1896, and coincided with the end of the court's jurisdiction over Indian Territory. In this lengthy and personal interview, Parker discusses conditions in Indian Territory, the nature of the cases he heard, his feelings on capital punishment, and how he was perceived by others. Most of the quotes associated with Parker are from this interview.",
