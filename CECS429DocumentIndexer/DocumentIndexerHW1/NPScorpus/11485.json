    "body": "Reading Room: Freedom of Information Act Responses - FY 2011       The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) gives you the right to access any Point Reyes National Seashore, National Park Service (NPS), or Department of the Interior (DOI) records unless the information in those records is protected by one or more of nine exemptions (reasons an agency may withhold records from a requester) and there is a sound legal basis to withhold them. Many of the FOIA response documents include redactions related to one or more of the nine exemptions under FOIA. In these cases, the FOIA exemption is noted and is explained in the associated transmittal letter. Additional information, including certain personal information, (e.g. personal addresses, phone numbers, and or personal electronic email addresses) has been redacted to maintain the privacy rights of these individuals. On this page you will find materials provided to members of the public and media who have requested them from Point Reyes National Seashore in Fiscal Year 2011 under the FOIA, as well as the final letter from the NPS to the requester. 2011 FOIA Log (8 KB PDF) - Brief descriptions of the FOIA requests listed below FOIA-2011-0857 (pending)  FOIA-2011-0856 (pending)  FOIA-2011-0720  Transmittal Letter - August 16, 2011, response to September 13, 2011, request (141 KB PDF) Released documents   Item 1 Item 2    FOIA-2011-0458  Transmittal Letter - June 6, 2011, response to May 13, 2011, request (23 KB PDF) Released documents   Superintendent's Compendium 2005 (160 KB PDF) Superintendent's Compendium 2008 (145 KB PDF) Superintendent's Compendium 2010 (302 KB PDF)    FOIA-2011-0420 (pending)  FOIA-2011-0382  Transmittal Letter - April 1, 2011, response to March 25, 2011, request (61 KB PDF) Released documents (151 KB PDF)  FOIA-2011-0367 (pending)  FOIA-2011-0358 (pending)  FOIA-2011-0243  Transmittal Letter - January 26, 2011, response to January 24, 2011, request (134 KB PDF) Released documents (736 KB PDF)  FOIA-2011-0198 (pending)  FOIA-2011-0150  Transmittal Letter - December 14, 2010, response to November 22, 2010, request (90 KB PDF) Released documents   1972 Deed and Reservation of Use and Occupancy (1,399 KB PDF) April 22, 2008, Special Use Permit (4,600 KB PDF)    FOIA-2011-0100  Transmittal Letter - December 15, 2010, response to November 17, 2010, request (74 KB PDF) Released documents (1,038 KB PDF)  FOIA-2011-0074  Transmittal Letter - April 18, 2011, response to November 4, 2010, request (87 KB PDF) Released documents (27,902 KB PDF)  FOIA-2011-0073 (pending)  FOIA-2011-0030  Transmittal Letter and Released documents - October 20, 2010, response to October 20, 2010, request (338 KB PDF)  FOIA-2011-0015  Transmittal Letter - October 7, 2010, response to September 21, 2010, request (694 KB PDF) Released documents (1,067 KB PDF)   Adobe® Acrobat Reader® is needed to view PDF documents.
