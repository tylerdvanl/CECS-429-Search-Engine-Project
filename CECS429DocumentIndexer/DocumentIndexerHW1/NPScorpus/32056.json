Predominant vegetation types within the park include approximately 5500+ acres of forest (including about 690 acres of forested wetlands), approximately 2200+ acres of emergent (herbaceous) tidal wetlands and more than 1100 acres of open fields. The park contains significant aquatic (wetland) habitats within the tidal systems found along the shores of the York and James rivers and in most of the tidal creeks to those rivers. In addition the parks wetlands, streams and ponds support a number of freshwater aquatic communities. Protection of these aquatic communities is important because the park provides unique opportunities for public observation, education and recreational fishing. The roadways and access areas throughout the park afford opportunities for close examination of wetlands and waterfowl as well as opportunities for swimming and fishing.",
