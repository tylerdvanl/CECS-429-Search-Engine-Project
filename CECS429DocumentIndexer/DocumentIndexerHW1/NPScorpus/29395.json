While the visitor center is on a hill, accessible parking is available behind the visitor center via \"Roosevelt Road.\"  See the inset map on the Local Area Map for details.  Battlefield   While the Tour Road is paved, and walkways at all Wayside Stops are paved, accessibility varies.   Steep hills at Stops 7 and 10 will limit accessibility. Neilson House, at Stop 2, has a moderately steep hill, and the house itself is not accessible.   Wilkinson Trail and other hiking trails are packed earth only, and are not accessible.        Schuyer House and Saratoga Monument Schuyler House Accessibility is limited, due to the historic nature of the structure.   4 stairs down from the parking lot lead to a 100-yard dirt path to the house. 3 stairs up lead into the house. A full flight of stairs are required to get to the second floor.  Saratoga Monument Accessibility is limited, due to the historic nature of the structure.   4 stairs up lead into the main chamber of the Monument. Getting to each of 5 levels above that requires use of stairs, over 180 for the top level.        Victory Woods The ½ mile pathway through Victory woods is a combination of boardwalk and poly-coated pea gravel designed for accessibility.",
