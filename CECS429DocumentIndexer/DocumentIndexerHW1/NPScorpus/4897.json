A “youth summit” is a chance for parks and young neighbors to share experiences, ideas, and problem-solving. Participants will examine real-world issues at stake in public lands across southern Arizona. Each park (Saguaro, Tumacácori, and Coronado) recruits and assembles a small cohort of high school juniors and seniors from its local area. The cohorts travel and meet at different park sites each weekend. Each overnight site visit includes a campout, service project, educational programming, and site-specific question. For example, students might glove up to clean and restore a badly damaged cave while asking the question, “What level of access to sensitive resources provides a balance between protection, preservation, and enjoyment of national parks?” Having examined 21st century issues and challenges of national parks in their neighboring communities, participants will participate in a facilitated dialogue with park and local government officials to recommend steps to take for the next 100 years.  The calendar begins with a welcome session with families on August 10. Four camping trips (August 20-21, September 10-11, September 24-25, and October 1-2) take participants to explore 21st century issues with hands-on and experiential projects. Graduation on October 22 will celebrate their accomplishments while giving parks needed insight into the next generation of public land stewards.  The youth summit is 100% free and open to any rising high school junior or senior in Santa Cruz, Pima, or Cochise County. All travel, gear, and meals will be provided. Graduates of the summit will receive a national parks pass and 60 hours of community or volunteer service credit. Plus, each will have gained a network of peers and land management professionals to help advance their academic pursuits.
