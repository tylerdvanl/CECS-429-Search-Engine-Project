Four distinct ecosystems melt into one another creating rich edge communities, or \"ecotones.\" These edges support an incredible array of wildlife, including hundreds of species of colorful fish, plants found nowhere else in the United States, and visitor favorites like pelicans, manatees and turtles. Winds, currents, storms and the park's close proximity to one of the nation's largest urban areas means that the entire park is in a constant state of flux — ever-changing in the face of  new challenges posed by the constant cycle of building and destruction.",
