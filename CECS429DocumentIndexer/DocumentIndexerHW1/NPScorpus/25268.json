The Bering Sea also happens to be one of the most productive marine ecosystems in the world, and it is teeming with abundant marine life! While in the area or while visiting our visitor center in Nome, you might catch a glimpse of beluga whales in Norton Sound or have the opportunity to view salmon migrating upriver to spawn. Rich stocks of salmon, microscopic plankton, fish, marine invertebrates such as king crab, whales, seals, and walrus can be found in the waters just off the coast of the Preserve. All of the animals are particularly well suited for living in the subarctic seas of the area. Due to our location and shallow, fruitful sea a host of species migrate through the area, although most, like the bowhead whale, are resident species that call this region home.",
