    "body": "Commercial Use Authorizations       Park-Specific Provisions A Commercial Use Authorization is required for engaging in any business in the park. Commercial business activity is prohibited within the park unless a CUA has been granted by the park (36 CFR Sec 5.3) CUAs are currently issued for one year. Permittee must reapply for a new CUA for succeeding periods upon expiration of the current CUA. There is no right or guarantee of renewal. CUA Fees CUAs are issued for a yearly fee of $150. This fee covers the costs associated with the administrative process of preparing and issuing the CUA including National Environmental Policy Act and cultural compliance approval if applicable. The authority for the National Park Service (NPS) to impose user charges to recover and retain costs associated with managing special park uses is found in 31 U.S.C.9701 and 16 U.S.C. 3a. Fees are non-refundable. Monitoring fees may also apply. The monitoring fee is determined by tracking how much it actually costs the park to monitor and\/or perform needed functions to properly manage the commercial use. Liability Insurance The NPS required all permittees to carry liability insurance. Reporting Requirements The Annual Survey Report is due within one month of the expiration of an authorization. Not returning this form by the due date is grounds for revocation or non-renewal of your CUA. To inquire about the CUA or to apply for one, please contact the Special Use Permits Office at 410-962-4290, ext 207 or e-mail.",
