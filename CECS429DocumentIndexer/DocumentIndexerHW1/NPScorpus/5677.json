Failure to obtain this permit may result in the issuance of a fine and\/or removal from the Preserve. As in any other unit of the National Park System, commercial visitor services may be provided only by those holding an authorization from the National Park Service. Larger visitor service operations are provided under concession contracts. Smaller, single-service businesses are issued commercial use authorization, if certain requirements are met.  Â    Note: If you are a nonprofit organization without taxable income, under the new National Park Service guidelines you are not required to obtain a commercial use authorization. However, you are required to obtain a special use permit.",
