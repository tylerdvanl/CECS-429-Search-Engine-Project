Fishing has proven to be a popular recreational activity here at Big South Fork. As a responsible angler you can do your part to preserve the environment and keep the river clean for the continued use of future generations. The Big South Fork NRRA follows the same rules and regulations set forth by the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency and the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources. For more information you can contact the Bandy Creek Visitor Center at (423) 286-7275 or visit the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency. In Kentucky you can call the Stearns Depot Visitor Center at (606) 376-5073 or visit the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife website.

Tennessee and Kentucky have reciprocal licensing agreements on boat fishing from Leatherwood Ford (TN Hwy. 297) to Yamacraw Bridge (KY Hwy. 92). Creel limits and other regulations of the state where the license was issued apply. Buy your fishing license online for Kentucky and Tennessee.      In the course of his work, Wildlife Biologist Steven Bakaletz has done extensive filming of the various types of animal life which call the waters of Big South Fork home.  The following clips feature Sunfish (30 seconds) and Largemouth Bass (15 seconds) as they swim unconcerned near the camera.",
