An ancient heiau (temple) stands at the end of the beach, as it did in times when Hawaiian settlements thrived in the area. In the waters before you lie 'Aiopi'o Fishtrap where reef fish were captured for food. Numerous sea turtles frequent the beach to feed on the limu (algae) and bask along the shore.",
