    "body": "Natural History Collection         Wood Rose NPS photo  Over 400 plant specimens were collected in 1993 from Dyea, the Chilkoot Trail and White Pass Unit in a reconnaissance-level natural resource inventory project. Other specimens have been collected since and the result has been the creation of a quality scientific voucher collection. In 2008, a lichens study and inventory were conducted which added hundreds of lichen specimens to the park collection.  At this time the Park has 5,739 catalogued herbarium specimens that have been carefully documented and identified. There are 40 voucher fish specimens, 9 mammal or bird specimens and two nests in the collection. Furthermore, all records, data and reports are maintained as part of the museum collection.
