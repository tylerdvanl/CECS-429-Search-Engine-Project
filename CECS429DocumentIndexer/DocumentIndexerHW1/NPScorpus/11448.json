The fruit of the manzanita is an important food source for bears, birds and other wildlife. Changes in weather and climate may influence the production of manzanita berries and when they are available. Manzanita flowers are pollinated by the virbrating wings of insects seeking nectar. If pollinators are not available when manzanita blooms, because of changes in temperature or precipitation, then this important food source may become scarce.",
