Image courtesy of the Ron Rittenhouse Collection   General Grant brought elements of three armies to Appomattox, the Army of the Potomac, the Shenandoah, and the James.  The Army of the James contingent consisted of two divisions of white troops of the 24th Corps, and one division of black troops of the 25th Corps.  This division of the 25th Corps consisted of two brigades, containing a total of seven regiments of United States Colored Troops (USCT).  More than 5000 USCT were involved in the fighting that took place on the morning of April 9, 1865, just west of the village, the Battle of Appomattox Court House, which trapped Lee's army and led to the surrender that afternoon.   Below you will find a list of all of the officers and men that made up these USCT regiments.    Â      A portion of Pvt.
