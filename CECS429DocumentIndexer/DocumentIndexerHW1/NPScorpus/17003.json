Visitors are required to pick up after their pets. NPS Photo  Pets are allowed in the campground and day use areas as well as on trails but must be on a leash at all times within the monument. Owners are responsible for cleaning up after their pets. Disposable plastic bags are provided at the monument trailhead for your convenience. Dogs are allowed on leash on the shuttle buses. All dogs riding the shuttle buses must also wear muzzles. Muzzles are available at local pet stores in Mammoth Lakes and at the Mammoth Mountain Adventure Center near the shuttle bus boarding area.      Your pet wants to have fun in the wilderness just as much as you do, but they have limitations as well. Your pet must be on a leash at all times within the monument and either leashed or within voice command in the surrounding national forest. Pets must be leashed in all parking lots, at trailheads, or in campgrounds, regardless of whether they are in the monument or on the forest. Devils Postpile is a pet friendly park and wants to make certain you and your pet have a safe and enjoyable visit. Review the following regulations and suggestions to ensure your pet’s safety. For your pet’s safety:  Pets are allowed in the campground and day use areas as well as on trails but must be on a leash. Leashes are required within the Monument and are strongly suggested in the surrounding areas. Devils Postpile is home to insects, poisonous plants and wild animals, so keeping your pet on a leash helps us protect your pet and preserve the wilderness.   If you do take your pet’s leash off outside of the Monument it is required that you have verbal control over your pet.  Do not leave your pet in your vehicle if the temperature is above 70 degrees fahrenheit. The temperature in the vehicle is often 10-15 degrees warmer even with the windows cracked. This can be fatal for pets. Do not leave your pet unattended for any amount of time. This is a wild place. Coyotes and bears have been known to harass pets.",
