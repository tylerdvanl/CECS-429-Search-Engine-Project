Understanding the forces that shaped the land here brings the breathtaking scenery alive.    This guide provides background information on the geologic forces which created the land, the glaciers that shaped it, and the gold that made it famous. The final section is a road guide- use it while driving up the first 18 miles of the Klondike Highway to see examples of the features described in this brochure.    As you travel throughout Southeast Alaska, keep an eye out for features similar to those described here. Enjoy your visit to Skagway!         Profile of the Earth's interior   CREATION OF THE LAND  Many forces, acting on the land around Skagway over millions of years, determined the modern appearance of the Skagway River Valley. But the origin of the local landforms began deep within the earth.   A number of layers make up the interior of the earth. At its center is the core, which has a solid inside and a liquid outside. Surrounding the core is a thick, semi-solid layer of magma called the mantle. On top of the mantle lies the crust, our solid land and ocean floors, relatively thin in comparison to the entire planet.           Global map of tectonic plates   The semi-solid mantle has currents, and flows very slowly. The crust floats on top and moves along with the currents. However, because it is a solid it cannot flow. It breaks into large chunks called tectonic plates.  There are 15 major tectonic plates worldwide. Southeast Alaska sits at the juncture of the Pacific Plate to the west and the North American Plate to the east. The flow of magma below forces these two plates together in a process called oceanic-continental convergence. The thinner Pacific Plate is being driven beneath, while the thicker North American Plate is overriding and crumpling up in the zone of contact.        Local tectonic motion   FORMATION OF THE COAST MOUNTAINS The collision of these two plates has resulted in three major types of geologic events: uplift, faulting, and magma injections.    Uplift  The crumpling of the North American Plate where it strikes the Pacific Plate is causing the relatively smooth surface of the crust to buckle and rise, similar to the hood of a car involved in a front-end impact. The land is lifting up to form mountains. The Coast Mountains surrounding the Inside Passage and Skagway are the result of this process of uplift.            Local faults   Faulting Just as the hood of a car forms dents and cracks under impact, the solid crust fractures under the pressure of oceanic-continental convergence. Fractures along which movement or slippage takes place are called faults, great cracks and lines of weakness in otherwise solid bedrock.   In this area the Pacific Plate is not only traveling towards the North American Plate, it is also rotating counterclockwise. Where the plates come into contact there are many faults that radiate out in different directions as they slowly move against each other. Energy from the plates' movement spreads out among all the fault lines instead of concentrating in one. As a result, Skagway frequently experiences earthquakes that are too small to feel.  It's common for rivers to find these lines of weakness to be the paths of least resistance. Some of the region's many faults lie below the Skagway and Taiya River Valleys.          Exposed pluton   Magma Injections The underside of the North American Plate is also impacted by oceanic-continental convergence. Fractures beneath the surface are commonly filled and expanded by intruding lava-like molten magma. Trapped within solid crust, these magma chambers cool slowly until hard, becoming huge bodies of granite called plutons. Uplift raises these plutons. Millions of years of weathering and erosion eat away at the miles of material on top of the plutons, eventually exposing them as the massive granite mountains north of Skagway.         Geology, Glaciers, and Gold sections  Geology (currently reading) Glaciers Gold Road guide       Photographs and figures were provided by National Park Service rangers B.
