    "body": "Work With Us       Seasonal jobs are being announced December through May. Each year, the National Park Service fills jobs in many fields, including interpretation, maintenance, administration, resource management, and law enforcement. Some jobs are office oriented, while others focus on working with the public, school children, or natural and cultural resources. Each job performs a vital function--that of providing visitors an opportunity to enjoy a unique experience, while working hard to preserve natural and cultural resources for future generations. Some jobs will be permanent year-round, or filled for \"terms\" of one to four years. These jobs are typically very competitive. Seasonal jobs are also available. Summer season offers more opportunities and usually runs from early May through mid-September, although some parks have seasons that start earlier and end later. Winter seasonal jobs usually run from October through March. National Park Service jobs are posted here: www.usajobs.gov",
