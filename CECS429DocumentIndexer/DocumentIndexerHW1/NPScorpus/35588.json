    "body": "Museum Collections       The Zion Archives contains over 300,000 documents, photographs, oral histories, slides, and maps related to Zion National Park from the founding of the park to the Civilian Conservation Corps as well as the current activities of the park. To assist researchers, finding aids are posted to this web site when collections are cataloged.  Finding aids contain information on the contents and significance of an archival collection. The finding aid may include descriptive information; repository information; collection history; biographical or historical information on creators of the collection; and in some cases a container or folder list of everything in the collection. with no finding aids are not yet fully cataloged. Approximately 22,500 objects are housed in the natural history collection at Zion. Study skins of mammals and birds, insects, paleontology specimens, and plant herbarium represent the biodiversity found in Zion National Park. The incredible diversity of plants and animals found in Zion is one of the unique and significant features of the park. These specimens provide baseline information about the natural environment of the park. This helps scientists and park managers understand how plants, animals, soil, and water were managed in the past and how best to manage them in the future.  The collection of cultural history artifacts provides a window into the lives of the people who have called Zion home. Over 30,000 artifacts tell the story of prehistoric settlement of the region by native Americans, early pioneer settlement and development of the canyon, the historic lodge and the Union Pacific Railroad, projects completed during the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps, and the planning and implementation of the parkâ€™s shuttle system. The cultural history collection also includes historic and contemporary works of art of Zion National Park. Significant pieces include paintings by Howard Russell Butler, Frederick Samuel Dellenbaugh, Anton Rasmussen, and William Henry Jackson. This page is currently under construction.
