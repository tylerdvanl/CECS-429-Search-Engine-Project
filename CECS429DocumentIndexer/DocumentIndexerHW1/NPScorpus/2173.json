May and October 2016 Native American Arts Auction The Friends of Hubbell Trading Post NHS, in partnership with the National Park Service, host the Native American Arts and Crafts auctions each year in May and October. Each auction has been successful. In the twenty years in existence, close to $2,000,000 has been returned to the artisans, provided scholarships for Navajo and Hopi college students, and work closely with Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site management to promote and actively secure funds for programs. Many local artisans look forward to being a part of these auctions. It is a fun event and provides for an opportunity to gather to meet with friends and make new ones. We hope that our visitors come and join us during this wonderful event either in May or October. For more information, please call Frank Kohler at (602) 571-1122.",
