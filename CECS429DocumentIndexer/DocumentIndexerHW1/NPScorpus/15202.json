Today, Manzanar is very relevant to children as we introduce ideas about civil liberties and what it means to be an American. We encourage families and school groups to visit Manzanar and share this experience with young people. Manzanar: Desert Diamonds Behind Barbed Wire In February 2007, Manzanar National Historic Site cooperated with Ball State University (BSU), the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, and the National Park Foundation to produce the \"Desert Diamonds Behind Barbed Wire\" Electronic Field Trip. Japanese Americans who had been confined in Manzanar, park rangers, and students brought history to life from various locations around Manzanar. You can watch the \"field trip\" online at http:\/\/www.schooltube.com\/video\/dfb7f72371e4928f1c82\/Desert-Diamonds-Behind-Barbed-Wire Stay tuned to this site as we develop more web-based activities and information for kids.",
