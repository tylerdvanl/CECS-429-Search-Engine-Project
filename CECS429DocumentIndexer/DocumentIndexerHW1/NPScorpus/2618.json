It was named for the Aztec Emperor, Montezuma II in 1864 by Texan soldiers on expedition from Fort Verde. It is doubtful that Montezuma was ever anywhere near the Well, but the name stuck. The area is rich with archaeological finds referencing the numerous cultures to find their way to Montezuma Well. Some were just passing through on pilgrimage, others settled at this unique oasis in the desert. The Well, considered sacred to many, is still being used today by many Native American tribes for religious and ceremonial purposes. Friends of the Well (FOTW) is a non-profit organization dedicated to the protection and preservation of Montezuma Well National Monument located in central Arizona just south of Sedona.
