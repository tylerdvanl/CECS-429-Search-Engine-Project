    "body": "Judge Isaac C. Parker         Judge Isaac C. Parker Fort Smith NHS  \"I have ever had the single aim of justice in view... 'Do equal and exact justice,' is my motto, and I have often said to the grand jury, 'Permit no innocent man to be punished, but let no guilty man escape.'\" -Judge Isaac C. Parker, 1896 For twenty-one years, Judge Isaac C. Parker held the bench of the U.S. Court for the Western District of Arkansas. His tenure was unique in the history of the federal judiciary; while most U.S. district judges toiled away on civil cases, Parker heard thousands of criminal complaints involving disputes and violence between Indians and non-Indians. He sentenced 160 people to death, and for fourteen years he did so while the condemned had no right of appeal. Sensational cases and mass executions overshadowed Parker's contributions in rehabilitating offenders, reforming the criminal justice system, and advocating the rights of the Indian nations. In Fort Smith he tried to create, in his own words, \"the moral force of a strong federal court.\" Remembered in Western novels and films as a \"Hanging Judge,\" Isaac Parker's real career and accomplishments in Fort Smith are far more fascinating and complicated.
