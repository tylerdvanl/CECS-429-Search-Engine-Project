Dogs must be on a leash, their owners must be holding the other end. It's for your pet's protection! 3) \"I can't flush!\" Please be considerate of other visitors and clean up after your pet. Disposable waste pickup bags are available at a few park locations, with trash cans at or very near the bag dispensers. 4) \"Oooh! New people to meet!\" Your pet might want to meet others, but please remember that some people may be nervous around dogs.",
