There are very few railings along the trail system so be aware of your footing and keep children and pets away from the edges of overlooks.  Wildlife No dangerous animals have been seen in the park, but stay aware while hiking the trails. Bears have not been seen in the park for many years, but could wander through the area. Rattlesnakes are known in the region, but enjoy the warm crevices in the limestone bluff face which are not located near the trail system.  Severe Weather Weather in the Upper Midwest can change quickly. Seek shelter in the Visitor Center during any weather event. There are no shelter up on the bluff trails. Slippery Boardwalks Wooden boardwalks at the start of the North Unit Trail and down the Yellow River Boardwalk can be very slipper in wet weather, including a light frost.  Ticks Walking the trials in the woods or prairie may expose you to tick bites. Stay on the trails to limit exposure and make sure to check your clothes after hiking.",
