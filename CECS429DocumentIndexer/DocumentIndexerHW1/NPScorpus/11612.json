Woodpecker Trail Closure - From July 14, 2015, until May 9, 2016 A temporary closure of the Woodpecker Trail was in effect in order to complete necessary hazard tree(s) mitigation and potential trail re-route to maintain public health and safety. Due to the presence of these hazardous conditions, use of the trail by anyone was deemed unsafe until these hazards were mitigated.

Patrick Visitor Center and continuing south to the current permanent elephant seal closure was in effect to better protect elephant seals from disturbance during the pupping season when they are exceptionally vulnerable. All public use was prohibited.

Determination of Temporary Trail Closure - signed on October 19, 2015 (24 KB PDF) Map of Temporary Closure (130 KB PDF) Point Reyes Beach Temporary Beach Closure - multiple weekends during the summer of 2015 A temporary closure of the beach area between the North Beach parking lot and the mouth of Abbotts Lagoon was in effect on numerous weekends during the summer of 2015 to better ensure the survival of federally-threatened western snowy plover nests and chicks within this area during the busy weekend. All public use was prohibited. Reproductive monitoring of western snowy plovers at Point Reyes has previously demonstrated that chick mortality is higher on weekend days than weekdays. Disturbance by park visitors in plover breeding areas can separate chicks from the adults, and the chicks may then not be able to forage efficiently, thermoregulate properly, and hide from predators. In 2013, for example, of the 11 newly hatched chicks in the proposed closure area, only 3 survived past the July 4 weekend. By late July of the 2015 breeding season, only a few chicks had survived to fledging age and additional protection measures were deemed necessary to assist in chick survival and the persistence of the Point Reyes western snowy plover population.

All visitors with pets were restricted from entering the temporary no pet access area from Thursday, June 4th through Wednesday, September 30 Monday, August 3. Pet restrictions around western snowy plover breeding beaches at Point Reyes are a current practice. Pets add additional disturbance to the plovers due to the similarities pets have with natural predators. Disturbance by pets can lead to nest abandonment, nest failure, adult fatigue, decreased adult fitness, and chick fatality. Pets are normally allowed on the entire beach between North Beach parking lot and South Beach parking lot due to lack of plover nesting activity in the area since 1995, but the discovery of a nest in the spring of 2015 necessitated a temporary pet restriction action. Upon discovery of the nest, park staff decided that a reduction in pet access needed to be implemented. The eggs in the nest successfully hatched and the chicks were able to stay in the area for the first couple of days after hatching before moving north of the North Beach parking lot, after which the temporary pet restriction was lifted.

Reproductive monitoring of western snowy plovers at Point Reyes has previously demonstrated that chick mortality is higher on weekend days than weekdays. Disturbance by park visitors in plover breeding areas can separate chicks from the adults, and the chicks may then not be able to forage efficiently, thermoregulate properly, and hide from predators. In 2013, for example, of the 11 newly hatched chicks in the proposed closure area, only 3 survived past the July 4th weekend.

Due to the presence of heavy equipment and maintenance activities, the parking area was impassable to all public vehicle and horse use during these repairs. Hikers and backpackers were allowed to access the restrooms, Coast Trail, and Mesa Road, but needed to park on the ocean side of Mesa Road south of the Palomarin Trailhead parking area. The parking area was closed from 7 am on Monday, March 30, 2015, through 5 pm on Friday, April 3, 2015.
