St. Elias    Â   The small town of Yakutat is located near the southern border of the park. Here is more information about the general area around Yakutat.ACTIVITIES AND SEASONS A wide variety of outdoor enthusiasts come here to hike the beaches, float or fish the rivers, surf ocean waves, explore the bays, view glaciers, climb mountains and enjoy the wilderness. Each season has its advantages and disadvantages. Numerous storms usually accompanied by high winds occur during the spring, fall and winter.  The spring bird migration begins in April. Thousands of gulls, geese, and seaducks can be observed, as well as hundreds of swans and sandhill cranes. The main wave of bird migrations passes through the last week of April and the first week of May. Grey and humpback whales can also be observed migrating off the coast. Spring is a time when steelhead are found in many streams, mountain goats are close to sea level, the snow is melting, and the lush coastal greenery begins to make its comeback. Summer is typified by meadows of wildflowers in bloom, eighteen hours of daylight, huge concentrations of Aleutian and Arctic terns along the coast, hundreds of harbor seals on icebergs, and salmonberries, blue berries and strawberries for the picking. In the fall, hundreds of thousands of salmon spawn in the many rivers and streams, drawing hundreds of foraging gulls, eagles, ravens, magpies, and brown bears. The fall bird migration begins in September, bringing sandhill cranes, Canada geese, snow geese, whistling swans and waterfowl through the Malaspina and Yakutat Forelands. Fall is also a peak time for sport fishing and hunting. During the winter, it is a quiet time. Waterfowl retreat from the coast to sheltered locations. Hundreds of Steller sea lions haul out at wintering sites along the coast. Wolf, moose and other animal tracks are readily visible in the snow. The daylight hours shorten to six per day, and on clear nights the aurora sweeps across the starry skies.Yakutat Tern FestivalThis festival centers around one of the largest known breeding colonies of Aleutian Tern. Witness the terns and the region's rich artistic and cultural heritage at this wonderful festival.
