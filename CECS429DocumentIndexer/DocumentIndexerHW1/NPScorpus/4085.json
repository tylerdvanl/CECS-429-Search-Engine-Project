    "body": "Ecosystems: Coastal Lowlands         NPS photo  Located between the tidal mud flats of Florida Bay and dry land, the coastal lowlands, also known as coastal priarie, are a well-drained region of shrubby, salt-tolerant vegetation. Periodic flooding and the onslaught of heavy winds brought on by tropical storms and hurricanes keeps these areas markedly devoid of mangroves. Salinity levels vary greatly among the lowlands, yielding a variety of salt-tolerant communities that thrive here. These communities are characterized by succulents and other low-growing, desert-like plants that can withstand the harsh growing conditions of the coast.",
