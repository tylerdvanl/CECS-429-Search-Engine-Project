Spanish documents state that in 1767 Nicolás de Lafora passed just north of the mounds, saying: “We forded this river [the Neches] in shallow water and one league beyond we climbed a hill. On the summit is a mound which appears to be hand-made.” Time period: Pre 1700–1800s Ownership: Public (Texas Historical Commission) A Photographic Journey of the Trail - NEXT IMAGE PREVIOUS IMAGE",
