Snow removal efforts may also allow for a brief period of bicycle access into the park from the East Entrance to the east end of Sylvan Pass (6 miles from the entrance) and the South Entrance (to West Thumb Jct) depending on road conditions for these early spring activities. The road from the North Entrance at Gardiner, Montana, to Cooke City, Montana, at the park's Northeast Entrance, is open all year to cyclists and automobiles, weather permitting. The first day of \"spring bicycling\" is never predetermined and is dependent on road conditions as determined by park staff.        Important Reminders   NPS, concessioner, and\/or construction vehicles will also be traveling roadways. Cyclists should ride single file on the right-hand side of the roadway. We recommend wearing a helmet and high visibility clothing. Road conditions will vary. Please use caution when riding. During the spring bicycling period public travel towards Old Faithful is prohibited south of the Madison Junction restroom and picnic area, and from Norris Junction to Canyon. Only authorized administrative travel may occur on these sections of road. An entrance fee is charged at the North Entrance.   The only campground open this time of year is at Mammoth Hot Springs.  There are no services open in the interior of the park and riders should be prepared to take care of all their own needs. Bring food, water, extra clothing, and a bicycle repair kit. Heavy snow and\/or rain occurs every April in Yellowstone.  Water is available only at Madison picnic area and Mammoth. There is very limited cell phone coverage; pay phones are available at Madison, Norris, and Mammoth. Wild animals have the right-of-way and can be dangerous and unpredictable. Do not approach or feed wildlife.  Cyclists are Required to:  Ride single file to the right. If riding before sunrise and after sunset, you must use a forward-facing white light and a rear-facing red light. Travel at night is not recommended. Stay 100 yards from bears & wolves and 25 yards from birds and all other wildlife.  Cyclists Should:  Wear a helmet and high visibility clothing. Turn around if bison are on the road. Do not cause them to run. Know how to minimize the dangers associated with a bear encounter. Carry bear spray and know how to use it.",
