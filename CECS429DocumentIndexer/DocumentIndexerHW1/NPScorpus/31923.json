    "body": "Donate        If you would like to make a monetary contribution to Federal Hall National Memorial, we can accept checks or money orders made payable to the \"National Park Service.\" Normally, money donated to the park is deposited in the \"general\" donation account, which typically funds educational and interpretive events. If, however, you wish to donate to a specific program or project, write a letter or note specifying how the money should allocated. The park would then establish an account to be used solely for that purpose. Checks or money orders can be mailed to: Federal Hall National Memorial ATTN: Superintendent 26 Wall Street New York, NY 10005",
