    "body": "National Register: Yosemite's List       At Yosemite National Park, there are more than 60 National Register properties with nearly 600 individual resources that have National Register status. Yosemite is home, also, to five National Historic Landmarks. Some properties have been determined \"eligible\" for listing, including both individual properties and historic districts. A determination of eligibility is an official finding, which requires State Historic Preservation Office concurrence, that a property meets the criteria for eligibility in the National Register without actually listing the property in the National Register. Upon further documentation, a property that is determined eligible can be listed on the National Register.
