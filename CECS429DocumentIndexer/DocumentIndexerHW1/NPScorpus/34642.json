Duration:4 minutes, 30 seconds                                Exploring Shenandoah's Backcountry: Part 2 This movie focuses on protecting both Shenandoah National Park's resources and yourself as you explore the park's backcountry.  Duration:7 minutes, 11 seconds               Shenandoah National Park has 196,000 acres of backcountry and wilderness and over 500 miles of trails to explore. Backcountry and wilderness camping allows you to immerse yourself in the beauty and challenge of Shenandoah's wild side. By carrying everything you need to survive on your back, up over rocky peaks and down though lush stream hollows, you can discover a world beyond where the pavement ends.    Preparing for Your Backcountry Trip Wilderness Campgrounds Appalachian Trail Hiking Safety    Closures In order to better protect the fragile plants that live on some of Shenandoah's rock outcrops, the park has implemented some very limited closures. Areas on Old Rag, Little Stony Man, Hawksbill, Old Rag, Mary's Rock, Mount Marshall, and Overall Run are closed to backcountry camping. If you planning a hiking trip and\/or a backcountry overnight trip to one of those areas, please check the following maps for new closures.  Printable maps with closures:   Old Rag Little Stony Man Hawksbill Mary's Rock Mount Marshall Overall Run  Additional areas are closed due to high use, or special natural or cultural resources that need added protection:   Limberlost Trail: closed area is bounded by Skyline Drive, Whiteoak Canyon Fire Road, and the Skyland-Big Meadows Horse Trail Hawksbill Mountain Summit: area above 3,600 feet Whiteoak Canyon: area between Skyland-Big Meadows Horse Trail and Cedar Run Link Trail Old Rag Mountain Summit: area above 2,800 feet Big Meadows: cleared area within view of Skyline Drive Rapidan Camp: area within .5 mile of buildings  Closed areas are signed and it is the camper's responsibility to know and observe these closures.   The wilderness itself is historic; the historic process that gave protection and allowed the return of wild nature is continuing. Shenandoah is both a preserving and a creating park.  ~ Darwin Lambert",
