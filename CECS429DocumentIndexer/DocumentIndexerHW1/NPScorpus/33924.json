The Confederate government evacuated and Union army units – including United States Colored Troops – entered the city. That moment foreshadowed the reunification of the United States, the end of 250 years of American slavery, and the beginning of an uncertain journey into freedom for African Americans here and across the country. From April 2 through April 4, 2015, Richmond National Battlefield Park will join with history and cultural institutions throughout the city to commemorate this momentous event in American history with a series of powerful and inclusive programs… …illuminations representing the city's devastating evacuation fires, …powerful programs commemorating the emancipation of the city's enslaved African Americans, …presentations and programs following in the footsteps of those who were here at this historic time, from evacuating Confederate officials, to African American Union troops arriving in the city, to civilians caught in the vortex of dramatic change, to President Lincoln as he explored Richmond while it was still smoldering. Save the dates and plan to join us for this once-in-a-lifetime experience.      150th Anniversary Programs Please check the Richmond's Journey website for program additions and updates.
