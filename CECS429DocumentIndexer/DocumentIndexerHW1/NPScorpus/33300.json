    "body": "Red fox        A red fox captured in repose just off the Mt. Finlayson trailhead. Visitors are urged not to feed these animals. Julia Vouri   Â    Because the red fox can be orange, silver, black, or any combination thereof, look for its distinguishing mark: a bushy, white-tipped tail. They also commonly have black \"stockings,\" white undersides, and ears that may be tipped in black outside with white inside. They look bigger than they really because of their thick, bushy coat, and even then can look rangy with tall, skinny legs.   Weighing about 10 to 14 pounds, red foxes are members of the dog family Canidae, and look similar to dogs, wolves, and coyotes. They have long, pointed snouts and erect ears, and are often seen because they prefer open habitats and are not strictly nocturnal.   While they are opportunistic, omnivorous feeders and will eat insects, birds, mice, snakes, rabbits, nuts, berries, and fruits, one of their favorite local foods seems to be the Townsend's vole. Watch as they creep low to the ground after their prey like a cat, stretch their head high to listen and look, then pounce with their forefeet.",
