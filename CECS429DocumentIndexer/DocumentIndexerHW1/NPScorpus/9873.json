Teams will receive questions randomly, so focusing on only one aspect of a region's history (mining, for example) is not advised. Teams should try to gain a broad knowledge of the four-county area encompassing Houghton, Keweenaw, Baraga and Ontonagon counties. Coaches should assist teams in finding good sources for local history research. If time permits, a trip to local historical societies or archives might be helpful. Field trips of the local area would also provide examples of historical artifacts and architecture still visible today.
