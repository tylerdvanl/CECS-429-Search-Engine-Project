    "body": "Winter Activities         During the winter months, visitors may enjoy snowshoeing, sledding, cross-country skiing, and hiking at the C&O Canal. NPS Photo  Ice conditions at the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park are not monitored by park staff. Ice skating and sledding are not permitted in the widewater area of the park. In other areas of the park, ice skating and sledding are permitted at your own risk. In most watered areas of the park, the canal ranges in depth from 6 feet to 15 feet and the canal maintains a constant flow of water beneath the ice. Please use extreme caution. Are you looking to ice fish along the C&O Canal? Review ice fishing regulations before heading out.    Â      The towpath can be an excellent place to cross-country ski and enjoy winter at the canal. NPS Photo  The C&O Canal has 184.5 miles of towpath for visitors to enjoy during the winter. When the canal is covered in snow, it offers a beautiful winter landscape for hikers and cross-country skiers.",
