This panoramic photograph of the reunion was taken in front of the historic courthouse and jail buildings.   Panoramic photographs of large groups of people were common to the era. The photographer arranged the people in a semi-circle and then used a special panoramic camera that panned the scene. In an interactive version of this photograph, you can get a better sense of where these deputies were standing and can zoom in on individuals and other details. This program was created for Fort Smith NHS by Bill Isenberger.  To view this version in a new window, click here. (It may take a little while to load.)
