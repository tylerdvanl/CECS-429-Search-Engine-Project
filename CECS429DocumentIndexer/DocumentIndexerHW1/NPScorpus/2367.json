Adults are small, only 1-2 inches long. Color varies greatly, ranging from tan to grayish to olive-gray.When exposed to sunlight, they often appear golden. The back has irregularly shaped blotches that are darker in color than the rest of the body. The inside of the hind legs (visible only when they jump) is bright yellow.  Habitat   Canyon tree frogs live in riparian zones, meaning that they are never found far from streams within the canyon. Despite being called treefrogs, Canyon treefrogs prefer to perch on boulders and rock faces overlooking pools of water.  During hot weather they spend the day hiding in rock crevices.  They can occasionally be found in the forests of the Rim.  Behavior   Adult canyon treefrogs are predators that feed on small invertebrates, including ants, spiders, beetles, and flies.  Tadpoles are herbivores that feed on algae in pools. Male treefrogs have a loud call, and are most vocal in the first few hours after sunset.  Males primarily call during the breeding seasons in the spring and late summer. Females lay 100 or more eggs at a time,  which are clear and jellylike. Within 2 months of hatching, tadpoles metamorphose into froglets, which look like miniature adults.         More Information Canyon Tree Frog  Canyon Tree Frog on Reptiles of Arizona",
