If you are interested in seeing a list of existing charter operators, please see the Park's list of Goods & Services. Overview Charter vessel means any motor vessel under 100 tons gross (U.S. System) or 2,000 tons gross (International Convention System) engaged in transport of passengers for hire and certified to carry no more than 12 passengers overnight and no more than 49 passengers for daytime use.  Charter vessels also include any uninspected motor vessel measuring less than 200 tons gross (U.S. Tonnage \"Simplified Measurement System\") and not more than 24 meters (79 feet) in length engaged in transport of passengers for hire. [36 CFR Part 13 Subpart N-§ 13.1102 Definitions].  Glacier Bay National Park, Vessel Management Plan Regulations became effective on January 2, 2007 that revised the definition of a charter (above) and removed the limit of 312 \"entries\". There is a daily limit of 6 charter vessels per day allowed in Glacier Bay Proper in June, July and August, seasonal quotas not applicable.  Charter vessels are not subject to daily quotas from September through May. Charter vessel use days are allocated among fifteen existing concessioners under a concession contract (listed below).  Concession Services Charter vessel concessioners are authorized to provide charter vessel services throughout Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve marine waters. Specific approval of the Superintendent is required for other services such as guided fresh water fishing, etc. Each charter operator is authorized a specific number of charter vessel use days into Glacier Bay Proper between June 1 and August 31.

Incidental Services Charter vessel services are also authorized under Commercial Use Authorizations (CUA) which allow charter services in marine waters west of Pt. Wimbledon, outside Glacier Bay proper and Dundas Bay all year and in Glacier Bay proper and Dundas Bay from September 1 - May 31. Additional information about the CUA, park specific terms and conditions of this authorization and how to apply can be found on the Park's Commercial Visitor Services page. We suggest that any prospective applicant contact the park concessions office to discuss their business plans prior to submitting the application form. In general charter services are not authorized on fresh water streams and lakes within the park. All Commercial Vessel Services are authorized in accordance with the Park's Vessel Management Plan. The Vessel Management Plan also provides for vessel use restrictions aimed at protecting park resources (humpback whale feeding, seal pupping, etc.).          Reporting As a reminder, the conditions of a CUA and Concession contract require guides and\/or boat operators to submit completed Activity Reports and Charter Fishing Survey Logbook Forms monthly, to be received not later than the 5th of every month for the previous month for all activity including fishing activity conducted within Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve.
