Grant wrote his memoirs, recording his efforts to win the war and preserve the Union.

Grant NHS, mirrored the rest of the nation during the years before the war. Grant opposed his father-in-law's ownership of slaves, but recognized his legal right to do so. In March 1859, Grant acted on his beliefs; purchasing William Jones in order to \"manumit, emancipate and set free said William from slavery forever.\"         Nellie Grant as The Old Woman in the Shoe at the Mississippi Valley Sanitary Fair, 1864.

President Grant declared, \"A measure which makes at once four millions of people voters...is indeed a measure of grander importance than any other one act of the kind from the foundation of our free Government to the present time.\" Women, black and white, could still not vote.",
