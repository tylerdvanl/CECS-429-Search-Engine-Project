Chamizal National Memorial offers over a mile and a half of trails right in the center of the city. Human-powered bicycles are welcome on any of the red gravel trails. They are not permitted, however, on sidewalks and the paved esplanade area in front of the Cultural Center. You may ride your bicycle in the roadways in accordance with Texas bicycle laws. Though bicycles are welcome on the trails, all other wheeled vehicles such as skates, skateboards and scooters are not allowed.   Please see the Superintendent's Compendium for more details about rules and regulations in the park.  Â     A ranger demonstrating Bike Safety. NPS",
