Many dogs enjoy visiting public open spaces; however, the excitement of being in wildland habitat and the smell of nearby wildlife can make even the most obedient dog overly excited and difficult to control. Using a leash while hiking with your dog will give you the ability to direct your pet and keep it safe.  Reasons to keep your dog on leash: Protect Your Dog   Nose-to-nose rattlesnake encounters. Unleashed dogs tend to wander nose first on the edge of the trail and off trails. This behavior can put your dog nose-to-nose with a rattlesnake. Depending on how much venom the snake injects into your dog, it could lead to the loss of your pet or, if you’re lucky it could cost $1,000 for the anti-venom vaccination.  Getting kicked by a frightened horse on the trail Getting sprayed by a skunk (your dog may not mind but you will) Falling off a cliff or caught in a sink hole Picking up ticks and fleas Collecting poison oak oils on fur and spreading it to you and the family Negative wildlife encounters Aggressive dog encounters   Protect Others   Other trail users, including small children, being approached, scared, or even tripped by an unleashed dog Bicyclists being chased by unleashed dogs Negative encounters between horses and dogs, which can lead to significant injuries Frightening outdoor experiences for people and children, who are afraid of dogs   Protect the Park   Keeping your dog on leash will help protect sensitive habitat and keep wildlife such as rabbits, squirrels, birds, and lizards safe! A dog on leash is less likely to chase or get chased by predator species such as coyotes and mountain lion. It’s important to beware that if a predator is cornered by a dog it will fight back potentially injuring or killing you’re pet.
