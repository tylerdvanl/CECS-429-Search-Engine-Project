    "body": "Camping       Where can I camp? Exit Glacier has a 12-site, tent-only campground. Campers must be in a designated site and are limited to a maximum of two tents and\/or eight people per site. You may not sleep in a RV, camper or other vehicle in the campground parking area and overnight parking is not permitted in any other part of the Exit Glacier area. Backcountry camping is allowed throughout the park except within 500 feet of a public use cabin or within 1\/8 mile of a road or trail at Exit Glacier. Do I need a permit or reservation to camp? No. However, if you are camping outside of the Exit Glacier Campground, we strongly encourage you to complete a free voluntary backcountry registration before going out. All campsites are first come, first served. Are campfires allowed in the park? Yes. Only wood that is dead and down may be collected by hand for fuel. In the Exit Glacier area, fires are limited to the steel fire rings at the campground cooking shelter and the picnic area. In other areas, we strongly encourage the use of fire pans and\/or the building of fires below the tide line on beaches. Any trash and burnt food must be removed from fire rings and packed out with other garbage. If you build a fire ring in the backcountry, dismantle it and scatter the rocks to leave a more pristine site for the next user. May I leave a cache of food, fuel, or other equipment? Property may not be left unattended for longer than 30 days. It must be marked with the owners name and address, and cannot contain more than 10 gallons of fuel. Exceptions to this rule may be made by the Superintendent on a case by case basis through a Special Use Permit.",
