    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Pets              Pets      Visitors traveling with pets should be advised, the National Park Service has prohibited pets on trails for many years. In particular, dogs and cats chase wildlife, pollute water sources, and can become defensive and dangerous in unfamiliar surroundings. Pet owners have the burden to assure their pet does not damage park values for others in those areas where pets are allowed. For the courtesy of other visitors, human companions are responsible for cleaning up and depositing pet feces in trash receptacles. Owners bringing their pets to Capulin Volcano National Monument need to be aware of conditions and policies that will effect their visit. Please keep in mind the following guidelines; Leashed pets may be walked on the Nature Trail adjacent to the Visitor Center; however, pets are not permitted on any other trails, in public buildings, or in undeveloped areas. Pets must be under physical control on a leash less than six feet long at all times. Properly restrained pets are allowed along public roads other than the Volcano Road and parking areas (generally within 25 feet of the road surface) and in the developed areas around the Visitor Center and the Juniper Picnic Area. Pets are also welcome in the shelter area at the Volcano Rim.Leaving a pet unattended in a vehicle with environmental conditions that pose a health risk to the animal is prohibited. The interior temperature of a vehicle can quickly warm to dangerous levels. Avoid leaving animals in vehicles. No pets, other than service animals, are allowed on the park transportation shuttle buses. Pet owners not adhering to regulations may be cited (minimum fine is $75). 36 CFR 2.15 (Code of Federal Regulations) provides more details concerning pets within National Park Service areas",
