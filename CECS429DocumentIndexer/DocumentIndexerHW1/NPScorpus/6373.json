Some volunteers help with administration, while some are project leaders for nationally recognized research. Students, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and 4-H groups often help with projects. Volunteers of all ages help at special events by setting up, demonstrating homesteader crafts, publicizing in town, guiding visitors through activities, and much, much more. We couldn't do it without them!  We also need volunteers for natural resource projects, such as deer surveys, native seed collection, or species monitoring. Help us protect our ecosystems!
