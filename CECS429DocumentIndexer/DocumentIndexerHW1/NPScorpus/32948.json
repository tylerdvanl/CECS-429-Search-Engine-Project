Â   Classrooms Visits Although nothing compares to an in-person visit to Olympic National Park, a field trip may not be practical or possible for your school or organization. If you are located within 2.5 hours driving time of the Port Angeles Visitor Center, an Olympic education ranger can come to you.  Education rangers provide hands-on, interactive programs designed to meet State of Washington learning standards for K- 12 students. Education rangers work with each classroom teacher in order to meet the educational aims and learning objectives. Program topics cover wildlife, geology, ecology, cultural history, park service history, wilderness, and much more.  Ecosystems Olympic Commonly referenced as three parks in one, Olympic National Park is truly a wonder of natural diversity. The \"Ecosystems Olympic\" program provides 4th grade students on the Olympic Peninsula an overview of the coastal, rain forest, and mountain ecosystems within Olympic National Park. This 90 minute program engages diverse learning styles and scaffolds the basic vocabulary to understanding ecosystems. Program occurs during the spring of each year. Pre and post visit activities are available, see attached Ecosystems Olympic Pre\/Post. Program abstract and state standards can be found here. Outreach Programs In addition to classroom visits, Olympic Park Rangers are available to attend your organization's meeting or special event. Rangers can staff a booth at fair-like events such as Earthday Celebrations or Science Nights, present programs to college classrooms, community organizations such as Scouts and 4H, senior groups, after-school programs, and many more. All programs are free of charge and availability depends on driving time, audience size, and staffing requirements. Winter Perspectives Series Long, dark Pacific Northwest nights got you down? Olympic National Park's winter perspectives series is the solution. Join researchers, artists, historians, and rangers as they present current projects and new understandings associated with Olympic National Park. Programs are from 7-8 PM, the second Tuesday of each winter month. The Park's partner, Friends of Olympic National Park, provides refreshments prior to the presentation. As a reminder, space is limited and seats often fill quickly; please plan accordingly. Check back in October for the Winter 2012\/13 schedule. To schedule a guest speaker please contact Olympic's Outreach and Education Specialist, Dean Butterworth or contact Olympic at: Outreach and Education Specialist Olympic National Park 600 East Park Ave. Port Angeles, WA 98362 360-565-3146",
