The pages of this Passport Book have a space to stamp or “cancel” the date and location of your visit to each of the areas in the park.  After you have collected all of the stamps, present your completed Passport Book to a Park Ranger a to celebrate your achievement. The cancellation stamps will be available at at least one spot in each park area and our Park Rangers will also have the stamp of each location where they are as they travel around the Blackstone River Valley.
