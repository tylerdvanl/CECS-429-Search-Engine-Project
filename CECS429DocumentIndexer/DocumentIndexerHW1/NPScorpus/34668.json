    "body": "Using GPS and Mapping Services       ATTENTION: There are numerous state roads that enter the park but are gated at the boundary. These are service roads and the public cannot enter the park via these routes, even though your GPS unit or a map service may direct you to use them. If you employ a GPS unit or an internet-based mapping service, makes sure it is directing you to one of the four entrances listed below.   Navigating with GPS:   Because Shenandoah stretches over 100  miles of Virginia, using GPS and internet-based mapping services like Google Maps and MapQuest can be tricky.You must enter the park via one of the four entrances and unfortunately only one has a physical address.Depending on your preferred GPS unit, you will either need to enter the entrance station name, the intersection, or the GPS coordinate.    Most individual in-park areas, such as Big Meadows Campground, are not searchable. When you enter you will receive a park map or you can download this one before you come.   Exception Old Rag Mountain Trailhead and Whiteoak Canyon Boundary Trailhead are two popular areas that you can access without using a Skyline Drive entrance. Downloadable maps and directions to these trail heads, and other hikes, can be found here.    Entrance Stations    Front Royal Entrance (AKA North Entrance): The northernmost entrance is off Route 340 (also called Stonewall Jackson Highway) near Front Royal, Virginia.  Thorton Gap Entrance: This entrance is off Highway 211 East (also called Lee Highway) near Luray, Virginia.  Swift Run Gap Entrance: This entrance is off Route 33 (also called Spotswood Trail) and has a physical address of 22591 Spotswood Trail, Elkton, Virginia.  Rockfish Gap Entrance: The southernmost entrance is off Highway 250 a few miles east of Waynesboro, Virginia.
