    "body": "Backcountry Management Plan       Grand Canyon National Park has started work on a Backcountry Management Plan and Environmental Impact Statement. The park's existing Backcountry Management Plan was completed in 1988 and needs to be updated to comply with current National Park Service laws and policies and the park's 1995 General Management Plan. Development of a revised plan provides an opportunity to look at alternative management strategies for protecting park resources and values while providing for a variety of visitor experiences within the backcountry. Once completed, the revised Backcountry Management Plan will guide management decisions regarding the park's backcountry and wilderness resources into the future. Learn more about this planning effort at the National Park Service's Planning, Environment and Public Comment website (parkplanning.nps.gov\/grca).      Current planning documents:  Draft Environmental Impact Statement, November 2015, available at parkplanning.nps.gov\/grca        Related planning documents:  1988 Backcountry Management Plan 1995 General Management Plan 1997 Resource Management Plan 1998 Draft Wilderness Management Plan 2010 Draft Wilderness Recommendation        Related research:  Day Use Hiking in Grand Canyon National Park Grand Canyon's Corridor Trails A Study of Visitor Use and Experience Mule Rider and Phantom Ranch Visitor Study Backcountry Day Hikers at Grand Canyon National Park When a Landscape is Bigger than Itself: A Stakeholder Analysis of Grand Canyon's Backcountry Overnight Backcountry Visitors at Grand Canyon National Park Rapid Site Inventory of Backcountry Campsites",
