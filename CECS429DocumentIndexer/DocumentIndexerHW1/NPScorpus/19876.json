After graduating with a master's degree from the University of Florida in 1934, Manucy went to work for the National Park Service, first on WPA projects and later on the permanent payroll. His career with the park service as one of its few, at the time, historians took him all over the United States, South American and Europe.   In his career as a National Park Service Historian, Manucy authored several documents in reference to Fort Frederica's history. The two largest and most influential were Fort Frederica's Historic Site Report in 1945, and \"The Fort at Frederica\". \"The Fort at Frederica\" is a summary and interpretation of the archeological work done on Frederica's fortifications in the 1940-50s.
