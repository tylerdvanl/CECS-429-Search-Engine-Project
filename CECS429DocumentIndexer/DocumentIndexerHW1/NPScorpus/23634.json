This was not always the case. Based on findings in archeological sites the native elk species, Merriam's elk, had long inhabited the Jemez Mountains and Bandelier but only in small numbers. By the early 1900's hunting had eliminated these elk from the area. In the 1960's elk were brought in from places such as Rocky Mountain National Park and were reintroduced onto the Pajarito Plateau.        Elk moms with their calves are much more likely to be seen in the higher elevations. photo by sally king  Elk in Bandelier Although elk may be seen any time of the year in Bandelier, you are far more likely to see them in the lower elevations, such as along the entrance road, in the winter.  Elk tend to migrate through the park with the seasons, moving from the higher cooler elevations in the summer to the lower less snowy elevations in the winter.  Bugling elk in the fall and young spotted elk calves in the summer are much more likely to be seen at the higher elevations within the park or in the nearby Valles Caldera National Preserve.        Bull elks sport a large set of antlers and have a unique call or bugle to attract mates and assert their territories. photo by sally king  Elk Courtship In the autumn if you are hiking in the higher elevations of the park you may hear a strange high-pitched whistling.  Bull elks not only grow a large set of antlers with which to defend their territory and attract females, but also have a distinctive call.        You are far more likely to see elk in Bandelier during winter than any other season. photo by sally king        Female elk, such as this one, are often seen along the park entrance road in the winter when heavy snow makes browsing in the high country difficult. photo by sally king        Although less common, sometimes large bull elk can be see along the roadway as well. photo by sally king        Bull elk are far more often seen in the park's high country or the nearby Valles Caldera National Preserve. photo by sally king",
