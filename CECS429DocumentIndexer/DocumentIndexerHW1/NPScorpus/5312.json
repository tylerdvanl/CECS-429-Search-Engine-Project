NPS PHOTO  Nature, the Army and recreation Fort Wadsworth  Before naturalist Henry David Thoreau moved to Walden Pond, he spent the better part of 1843 in Staten Island. He enjoyed walking to the remains of old Fort Richmond, a sandstone hulk near the Narrows, and watching the waves, the ships and the shorebirds. In the 1860s, Battery Weed was built here to defend New York Harbor. Fort Wadsworth, as it was named after the Civil War, still watches over the Narrows, its ships and the wildlife that still finds its way here. A lighthouse was added to Battery Weed in 1903, which was made obsolescent by the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.  Miller Field Now known mainly as a place to play Little League games and other team sports, this area once belonged to the Vanderbilt family. In 1920, the U.S. Army converted the former farm into an Air Coast Defense Station. Miller Field saw a variety of military capacities until its deactivation in 1969, when it boasted the last grass runway in New York City. Miller Field includes the former sight of the Elm Tree Lighthouse. Great Kills Park Nature bounced back when Great Kills, a former landfill, was capped and converted into a New York City park, joining it with Crooke's Point, known for its natural beauty and wildlife.",
