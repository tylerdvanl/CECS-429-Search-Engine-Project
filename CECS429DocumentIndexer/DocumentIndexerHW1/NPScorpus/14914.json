    "body": "Fishing              Fishing in the Green and Nolin Rivers is good throughout the year, with spring and summer being the most productvie. Bass, crappie, bluegill, muskellunge and catfish, along with almost 100 other species, frequent the river. State creel and size limits apply (see below) but you do not need a state fishing license as long as you fish within park boundaries. In the park, you can fish with pole and line, rod and reel, or trot\/throwlines; other methods, including limb lines and jug lines, are prohibited. If you use trot lines, you must attach a tag with your name and address, place hooks 30 or more inches apart, tend your lines daily, and remove lines when you are not using them. At Sloan’s Crossing Pond and First Creek Lake, using any live bait other than worms is prohibited. On the rivers, you may use minnows or worms. Using bait seines in the park is strictly regulated, so please check with rangers for specific rules and regulations. Because park wildlife is protected, collecting frogs, turtles, or other aquatic fauna, or digging for bait, is strictly prohibited. The number and size of fish you may take while fishing in the park is restricted; obtain an online copy of the Kentucky Department of Fish & Wildlife Fishing and Boating Guide or request a copy from the park Visitor Center Information Desk and familiarize yourself with Kentucky creel and size limits before you fish.",
