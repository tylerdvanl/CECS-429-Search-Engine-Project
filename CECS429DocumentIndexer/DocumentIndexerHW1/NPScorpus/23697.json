NPS Photo by Sally King  Although in general appearance cactus seem all thorns, when they bloom, what a beautiful sight. Claretcup cactus with their red-orange flowers, Prickly pear with its yellow or sometimes pink blossoms, and Cane Cholla with their hot pink flowers are eye-catching indeed. Many of these succulents were also important to the Ancestral Pueblo people.",
