The primary focus of collecting is to document the lives and activities of the planners of the 1848 First Women's Rights Convention and the people who signed the Declaration of Sentiments issued from that convention.   The bulk of the collection is made up of three kinds of artifacts.  1. Artifacts recovered during archeological investigations of park sites. (Wesleyan Chapel, Elizabeth Cady Stanton House, M'Clintock House, and Hunt House)  2. Things created or used by families that planned the 1848 First Women's Rights Convention which were purchased, donated, or on loan from family members or other institutions.    3. Architectural samples selectively removed from historic structures while researching their historical appearance.   The park also cares for items reproduced from family collections or other institutions for exhibit in our historic houses.
