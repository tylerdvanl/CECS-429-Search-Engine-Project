    "body": "Commercial Filming and Still Photography Permits       On April 14, 2006 the National Park Service published a final rule in the Federal Register that allows the NPS to implement Public Law 106-206 (P.L. 106-206), codified at 16 U.S.C. 406\/-6d and amends the commercial filming and still photography regulation found at 43 CFR 5.1. All commercial filming requires a permit. Commercial filming is defined as digital or film recording of a visual image or sound recording by a person, business, or other entity for a market audience, such as for a documentary, television or feature film, advertisement, or similar project. It does not include news coverage or visitor use.  Use this application form to apply for a commercial filming permit.  Use this chart to see what fees are associated with the permit.
