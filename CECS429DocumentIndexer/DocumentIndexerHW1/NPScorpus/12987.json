In winter, the path may be snow-covered or icy.            Stay Safe  Boardwalks are slippery when wet and even more so when covered in snow or frost.    Water Water is not available along the trail. A drinking fountain is located at the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center, where you may choose to end or start your walk. Additionally, a water fountain is available near the Lower Yosemite Fall restrooms.  Restrooms Restrooms are not available along this walk.

Transportation  You can begin this walk at the the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center, accessible by the Valley Visitor Shuttle (7 am to 10 pm year-round) at shuttle stop #5 and #9. From there, walk west along the bike path toward Lower Yosemite Fall. At shuttle stop #6, cross the street and follow the bike path.

Leashed pets, bicycles, and strollers are allowed. Also, stay on the path. Do not venture out into the meadow, which causes trampling and damages the ecosystem, which is important to the many plants and animals that thrive in this fragile environment. Keep your food within arm's reach at all times and do not feed the wildlife. Carry out all trash and food waste (fruit peels, shells, etc.).
