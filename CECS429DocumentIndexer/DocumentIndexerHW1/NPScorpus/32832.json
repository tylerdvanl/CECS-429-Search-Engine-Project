There are almost 140 backcountry campsites available, from boat-in sites to high alpine backpacking sites. Camping is allowed only at established sites along trail corridors. Camps include toilets, tent pads, and in some cases tables and firepits. All backcountry sites require a free permit available at ranger stations. Permits are issued on a first come, first served basis.  For full trip planning information, visit the Wilderness Trip Planner page.",
