Here, fossils from all three units of the park, as well as those from other federal lands in the area, are on display for visitors to see up close.         Ranger leading a hike through the Blue Basin's Island in Time trail. NPS photo  There are quite a few trails within the vicinity of the visitor’s center. Please remember that all fossils, historic structures, archeological features, rocks, plants and animals are protected and may not be collected or disturbed. For the protection of fossils under the surface, walking on the exposed fossil beds is prohibited. This includes the badland-like surfaces that have few to no plants growing on them.  In the summertime, make sure to keep water with you or accessible as necessary.        Green claystones at the Foree trailhead NPS photo  Colorful Strata...  The Sheep Rock unit contains an amalgam of colorful strata and complex geology. From Cretaceous conglomerates to the flood basalts, the geologic features in this portion of the monument are a spectacle to behold.  The predominant exposures of green rock seen on Sheep Rock are a multitude of reworked layers of volcanic ash. The rich green color of the claystone was caused by chemical weathering of a mineral called celadonite. This happened millions of years ago as water moved through the alkaline ash beds under high pressure.",
