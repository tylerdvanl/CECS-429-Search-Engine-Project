The Friends work in co-operation with the National Park Service by raising funds through donations and grants and by volunteering time and skills to complete a long list of projects proposed by the park management. Explore their web site at www.friendsofsleepingbear.org to learn more about the organization. They are always looking for more people who share their desire to make Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore even better. You can join from their web site, then come to one of our meetings and meet some new people while enjoying the beauty and history of the Northern Michigan lakeshore. The Friends meet once each month from April through October. They operate the Adopt-A-Trail program for the park, so if you are interested in helping keep hiking trails in good shape, let them know. Also, the group raises money through grants and donations to fund projects that enhance the quality of our park. Preserve Historic Sleeping Bear Preserve Historic Sleeping Bear is a nonprofit partner of the park founded in 1999 to focus solely on assisting the park in preserving and interpreting its rich pioneer heritage. Over 360 historic remnants of early 19th century farmsteads, maritime buildings, logs, inns, one-room schoolhouses, and other historic features grace the landscape on the mainland and the Manitou Islands. This includes the large collection of farmsteads in the Port Oneida Rural Historic District. Preserve is bringing history alive again, and you can help!  Each year Preserve works with the Park to select a variety of preservation projects which require funding and volunteers. Preserve has preserved dozens of structures, funds an antique orchard-grafting program, runs an adopt-a building\/orchard program, and restores historic farm fields. Preserve's interpretive programs tell the story of pioneer life in this area. They run the Port Oneida Heritage Center and offer tours and classes in traditional skills of the period. Preserve is a co-founder of the Port Oneida Fair hosted by the Lakeshore. Volunteers and funds are needed for projects, programs, and events. Sign up to volunteer and meet other like-minded folks, get on our email list, or make a donation at www.phsb.org.
