Rare Wildflowers of the Ozarks  by Fred L. Fox Former Lower Ozarks Project Director The Nature Conservancy  Everyone likes wildflowers, and there is something for every wildflower enthusiast in the Ozarks. From the bloom of spring beauties in late winter, to the last goldenrods of November, there is always a floral display somewhere. Many of our most appreciated wildflowers, like fire pink, larkspur, purple coneflower and columbine, are common here and easily identifiable for the beginner. There are few better places than the Ozarks to catch sight of some of the rarest and most unusual wildflowers. Several dozen species of plants are endemic to the Ozarks, meaning they live nowhere else in the world. Plus, several globally rare plants, as will as many that are rare in Missouri, can be seen in the Ozarks.  If you are just starting out, a good field guide, such as “Missouri Wildflowers,” is a must. Here are some rare and unusual wildflowers to look for on your visit to the Ozark National Scenic Riverways.       Loesel’s Twayblade, (Liparis loeselii). This member of the orchid family was first found in Missouri in 1936 in Shannon County. Although no additional sightings occurred until 1979, it is now known in six Missouri counties. Its yellow-green flowers are visible in May and June, and it is most likely to be seen in fens (grassy wetland areas), alder thickets and at the edge of sinkhole ponds.         Showy Lady’s Slipper    (Cypripredium reginae) A large, rare and extremely beautiful member of the orchid family, it can be found at the base of north facing limestone bluffs along small streams, and in fens and wet swales. It flowers from the middle of May until early June.           Early Ladies Tresses (Spiranthes lucida) Another orchid, it is rare in Missouri. In flower from mid-May through June, it is the only species of ladies tresses found here that flowers in the spring. It can be seen in fens and other wetland areas.         Royal Catchfly (Silene regia) This striking plant may grow as high as five feet, with bright red flowers. It flowers from May through September, and can be seen in remnant prairies and open woods. In Missouri, it is known only in the Ozarks.         Rein Orchid (Platanthera flave) This rare orchid produces greenish- yellow flowers in June and July, and can reach a height of two feet. In Missouri, it is known to occur in only five counties.         Heart-leaved Plantain (Plantago chordata) once common throughout the eastern United States, this plant survives in a very small handful of sites outside the Ozarks, making this its last stronghold. Siltation, pollution and other water quality degradation of previously clear, gravel bottom streams caused this plant’s disappearance from much of its former range. Look for it in small gravel creeks throughout the area.         Forked Aster (Eurybia furcatus) Another edge of range species, it blooms on wooded slopes in August and September. New flowers are almost pure white, becoming rosy or lilac colored with time.        NPS photo by Dan Swofford  Ozarks Wild Crocus (Tradescantia longipes) This beautiful flower is found in the Ozarks, and nowhere else on Earth. Its variably colored flowers (magenta, purple, purplish-blue) are visible in April and May in heavily forested areas surrounding the Current River and its tributaries. Learning to identify wildflowers and other plants can be a very rewarding experience. But please, don't pick or dig wildflowers and other plants. Leave them there for others to enjoy also.
