These pages detail the opportunities for learning through a visit to the park, or study about the park. Water Snapshot The water snapshot program was devised to allow students to get a \"snapshot\" of the health of the Delaware River basin and learn how they can make a difference in their own back yard.  The 2015 Water Snapshot Report is now available.   Traveling Trunks Upper Delaware's traveling trunks cover a wide variety of environmental themes such as birds of prey, wildlife, bats, and animal tracks as well as several topics of interest including the National Park Service and the Lenape Indians.
