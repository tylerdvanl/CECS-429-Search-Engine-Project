The Foundation is a private, nonprofit educational organization that continues to work in partnership with the National Park Service to enhance preservation and understanding of the heritage and lasting significance of Gettysburg. The Gettysburg Foundation has grown in the past two years when it merged with the Friends of the National Parks at Gettysburg in support of a common mission with assets that include thousands of volunteers, a variety of on and off-site educational programs, a successful track record of fundraising at the five, six and seven-figure level among corporate, foundation and individual donors, and an established grassroots fundraising network. The Gettysburg Foundation offices are located in the new Museum and Visitor Center at 1195 Baltimore Pike while maintaining offices and educational exhibits in the historic Rupp House on Baltimore Street in Gettysburg.
