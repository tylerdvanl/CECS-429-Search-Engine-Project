    "body": "Reading Room       Welcome to the Point Reyes National Seashore Reading Room! The purpose of these pages is to provide park management documents, reference materials, original data, and background information that will help inform you about how the National Park Service manages the 90,000 acres that comprise the Seashore. These pages will be updated frequently as issues of importance change and new topics of interest arise. Some of the information you will find in the Reading Room is considered \"raw data\"—collected by park staff and volunteers and not yet analyzed. Some of the information is analyzed and presented in the form of final reports. And some of the information, such as that contained in the Freedom of Information Act Responses page, has previously been requested by members of the press or public and is therefore being provided to all.      Photographs and Video Freedom of Information Act Responses Other Documents of Interest Background Documents for Drakes Bay Oyster Company Special Use Permit Environmental Impact Statement Top of Page",
