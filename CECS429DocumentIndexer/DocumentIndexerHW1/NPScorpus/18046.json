All visitors must stop and pay a fee or show a pass to gain entrance to the battlefield and\/or the visitor center.  Once inside the Visitor Center there is a 28 minute orientation film \"Thunder in the Ozarks.\"  The park's film was produced in 2001 and provides the visitor an excellent production on the reasons for the battle and what happened during and after the battle. The park's museum was opened in 1963, but the exhibits have been completely updated as of February 2010. The park's Eastern National Bookstore is also located in the Visitor Center.  The bookstore has one of the finest Civil War related selection of books in the National Park System. The only restroom facilities in the park are also located in the visitor center.",
