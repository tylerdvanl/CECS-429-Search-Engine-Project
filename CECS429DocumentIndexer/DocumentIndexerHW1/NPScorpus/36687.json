    "body": "Riggs Spring       This site is on the Riggs Spring Loop 3.3 miles (5.3 km) from Rainbow Point and 1.6 miles (2.6 km) from Yovimpa Pass. There is reliable, but most times muddy, water at Riggs Spring next to the site. The area is a clearing with a few Ponderosa Pines and Aspens. It is 1601 feet lower in altitude than Rainbow Point, so it is an easy hike down and a hard hike up. Datum WGS 84, 37 27 00.8 N, 112 14 26.6 W. Altitude 7514 feet (2290 m).
