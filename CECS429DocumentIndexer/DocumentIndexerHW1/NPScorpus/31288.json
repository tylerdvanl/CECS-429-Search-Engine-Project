    "body": "Preservation       Preservation is about deciding what's important, figuring out how to protect it,and passing along an appreciation for what was saved to the next generation. Preservation is hands on.   Howard University, working with noted scholars and researchers throughout the United States, conducted intense research and analysis into the history, bioanthropology and archaeology of the African Burial Ground site. Three component reports were published-the African Burial Ground Final History Report, the African Burial Ground Final Skeletal Biology Report and the African Burial Ground Final Archaeology Report. The reports present the results of three separate but complementary avenues of research and analysis-historical, bioanthropological and archaeological. Read the Howard University research here. The freshman class of Howard University visits African Burial Ground annually to honor the University's role in the site's beginnings.        Howard University's College of Arts and Sciences Howard University created a video of their visit to the African Burial Ground. Watch the video here.        Silver pendant recovered with Burial 254 NPS  Burial 254 is of a child between 3 ½ and 5 ½ years old. A silver pendant was recovered during laboratory cleaning of the skeletal remains. It was found near the child’s mandible and may have been worn as an earring or strung around the neck. The original artifacts were reinterred with 419 ancestral remains in 2003; however, replicas of some of the original artifacts are displayed at the Visitor Center.",
