The climate of the region is strongly influenced by the ocean which contributes to over 50 inches of rain per year. Expect rainy weather during spring and fall at the Monument and bring your rain gear!  Visit NOAA for the latest weather updates. Please note that other weather apps may display Cave Junction weather conditions and not the current conditions at the Monument. It is highly recommended that you use the NOAA link provided above.  If you plan on attending a cave tour, you should bring a warm sweater and sturdy shoes to dress for the 44 F (7 C) cave.
