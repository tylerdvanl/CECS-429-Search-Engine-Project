    "body": "Join Our Friends       Ever since its establishment in 1842, Fort Scott has been a driving force in Southeast Kansas. We may not need protection on the \"Western Frontier\" anymore, but we recognize and appreciate the national attraction our Fort has become. The story of our history from Westward Expansion to Bleeding Kansas and beyond is our story and our National Historic Site helps us tell it. To continue the important work of telling its stories, Fort Scott has established a friends group to provide support and raise funds for various activities. Find out more about the Friends of Fort Scott National Historic Site by visiting its Facebook page.  What is a Friends Group",
