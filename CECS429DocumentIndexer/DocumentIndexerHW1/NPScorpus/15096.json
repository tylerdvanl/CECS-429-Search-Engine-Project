View photos of wildflowers in the park in our wildflowers photo gallery, download a copy of our wildflower guide (463 KB, pdf) featuring some of the most commonly sighted wildflowers, or download a copy of the extensive park flora list (175 KB, pdf). Blooming times vary each year and are greatly affected by the winter's snowpack. Blooming time also varies with each wildflower species. For example, mountain mules ear, snow plant, and western wallflower bloom earlier in the season, while California corn lily and silverleaf lupine tend to bloom later. Below are some rough estimates for wildflower appearance:    Park Area Elevation Range Approximate Season   Warner Valley 5,600 - 6,000' late-May through early July   Manzanita Lake 5,900 - 6,500' late-May through early July   Butte Lake 6,000 - 7,000 June through July   Southwest 6,000 - 7,500' June through July   Summit Lake 6,500 - 7,500' Late-June through early-August   Juniper Lake 6,800 - 8,000' Late-June through early-August   Lassen Peak 7,500 - 8,000' Late-July through September",
