Immense tectonic forces wrinkle and crumple terranes to form the Alaska range that looks like a spiny backbone to the park. Denali towers over the landscape at 20,310 feet tall. Its dominant presence reminds all that come to the park of the immense power of the Earth. Glaciers etch out the land and fill up 16% of the park, appearing like white snakes slithering out of the mountains. Fossils of the park's prehistoric past show a story of a warmer past where dinosaurs roamed what is now this park. These are just a few of the amazing geological phenomena that occur in the park.
