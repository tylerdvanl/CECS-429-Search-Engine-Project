    "body": "Replace\/Rehabilitate Hewlett Field River Access       The Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area desires to improve access to shared resources at the Island Ford unit of the park. The purpose of the design-build for Hewlett Field Access Road Improvement Project is to provide concessionaires and park visitors an improved public access road to Hewlett Field and the boat launch area. This project would provide a well-designed, sustainable access road to the Hewlett Field area of the Island Ford unit of the park. The current access road is gravel, poorly routed, incongruously contoured, and used only as an emergency\/administrative access to the field. The design-build project also includes grading and improvements to a portion of the walking trail near the visitors contact station. The completed project would improve the walking trail to provide better access and facilitate the use of the river access point by individuals and groups.
