Federal law also prohibits firearms in certain facilities in this park; those places are marked with signs at all public entrances. This also applies to concealed firearms with a valid CCW. It is the responsibility of park visitors to understand and comply with all applicable state, local, and federal firearms laws before entering this park. As a starting point, please visit the State of California Penal Code web site (see Part 6 - Control of Deadly Weapons).   Telephone Scams An illegal telephone scam is mentioning Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. This scam claims that payment is due for an infraction or that the caller can assist in handling legal issues with the Federal Magistrate. The goal of the scam is to defraud people of money. Do not send money or give any information. Many such phone, email, and mail scams exist. If you receive such a call, go to https:\/\/www,consumer.ftc.gov to see information about scams and file a complaint; the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) handles such crimes.
