The eastern end is the entrance of the park, and the western terminus is in Kantishna. Traffic on most of the road is restricted to a variety of bus services.  The possible housing options for researchers are broken into two categories: between the park entrance and Mile 35 of the Denali Park Road, and everything west of Mile 35. Park campgrounds are of course open to the public as well as visiting researchers.  Note: There are costs associated with anywhere you stay, including park transient housing (Apartment 51F and the Panabode). Check with the park research coordinator about specifics.
