Nestled amid the fields, forests and streams of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, the facilities were once the charming farm village of Bevans. Through adaptive reuse, these historic buildings now serve as a gathering place for a thriving community of artists and environmentalists.   Between May and September each year, Peters Valley School of Craft offers over 125 intensive 2-5 day workshops in Blacksmithing, Ceramics, Fiber Arts, Fine Metals, Photography, Printmaking, Woodworking and Special Topics. Peters Valley offers a variety of opportunities for both established and emerging artists to pursue their personal and professional growth and development.
