As a former farm, the developed areas of the park have a wealth of ornamental plants like azalea, cherry, dogwood, iris, lilac, rose althea and spirea that were popular garden plants in the mid 20th century. There are known species of hardwoods and other native flora in the park like ash, American Holly, beech, oaks, pines, tulip tree and wild azalea. An inventory of both native and garden plants by scientists from the University of Maryland began in April 2004.",
