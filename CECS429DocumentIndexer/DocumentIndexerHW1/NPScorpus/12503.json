As stewards of these resources, the National Park Service and California State Parks are taking a leading role in climate change response. Through the Climate Friendly Parks and Cool Parks programs, Redwood National and State Parks is assessing and reducing its contribution to climate change while educating staff and visitors about its impacts. These actions help preserve our natural and cultural treasures for future generations.      Visit Climate Friendly Parks online at www.nps.gov\/climatefriendlyparks To learn more about Cool Parks, visit www.parks.ca.gov\/?page_id=24872 Also check-out Do Your Part!—an interactive online program for park visitors and supporters with information and tools to understand and reduce their carbon footprints and thereby help to protect our parks from climate change: www.doyourpartparks.org                    Climate Friendly & Cool Parks   6 Photos  Some of the more visible actions Redwood's already taking towards becoming a Climate Friendly Park",
