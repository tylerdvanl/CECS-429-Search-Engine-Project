Pets must be on a leash of not more than 6 feet in length at all times and owners need to clean up after their pet. There are no fees for walking the park grounds, only for accessing the buildings in the historic area. Pets are not permitted in buildings and you cannot tie them to park features or facilities. Service animals, of course, are not pets and are welcome to assist their owner as needed. Weather: Allegheny Portage Railroad National Historic Site is open in the winter. The park is located in Cambria County, PA, and is at the summit of the Allegheny Mountains. Therefore, the park often takes on winter extremes. If planning on traveling from a long distance, please contact the park beforehand to ensure that the facilities are open. Please consult weather forecasts to ensure conditions are safe to travel in. Vehicles: Please park vehicles in designated parking areas only; parking on grassy surfaces may result in being ticketed. Please lock and secure your vehicle upon leaving it and make sure all valuables left in vehicles are put out of sight.",
