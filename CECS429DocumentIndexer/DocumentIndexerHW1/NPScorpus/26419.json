Our popular horse fossil and general fossil kits are also available to check out! Teacher Packet  Horse Family Tree A 2 to 2 ¾ hour study program for 9th grade to undergraduate college level students. On site presentation of the Horse Fossil Study Kit, listed below. Students investigate evidence of natural selection and evolutionary processes through the study of horse fossils. Emphasizes structure and function in horses and adaptations to a changing world. Meets ODE science standards for: Life Science, Earth and Space Science and Scientific Inquiry. Ashfall Discoveries A 2.5 hour program for students, grades 3 to 6, focusing on how fossils move from discovery to the laboratory and then to the museum. Students hike into a simulated field site; find their location on an aerial photograph, search for fossil replicas, learn about and take field notes, participate in a hands-on lab simulation, and explore the fossil museum with a ranger. Pre-visit and post-visit activities are essential for the success of this program. Meets ODE science standards for: Life Science, Earth and Space Science and Scientific Inquiry. Museum Detectives A 1-1.5 hour program for students grades 3 to 7. This hands-on program focuses on the use of clues, comparisons and observations in the science of paleontology. Students learn about the fossil laboratory, participate in a hands-on lab simulation and take part in a museum scavenger hunt. Pre visit activities are recommended for the success of this program. Meets ODE science standards for: Life Science, Earth and Space Science and Scientific Inquiry. Blast From the Past! A one-hour, participatory activity for young students, grades 1 to 3. It features a volcano activity, followed by a fossilization activity. Discusses Oregon geography, volcanic deposition, and fossil preservation processes. Meets ODE science and social science standards for: Life Science, Earth and Space Science and Scientific Inquiry and Geography. Ranger-led Hikes and customized programs may be available upon request Contact the Education manager to discuss details.
