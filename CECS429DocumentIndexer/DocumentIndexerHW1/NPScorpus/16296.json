    "body": "Help Protect Sites       Archeological sites, like other resources in the park, are protected under federal legislation. If you come upon archeological materials, do not remove, but report your findings to a park ranger, who will record this information. The locational information is very important to our understanding of the past human habitation of Yellowstone National Park. Removal of artifacts from their location destroys essential information needed in order to study past humans. If you see anyone collecting or destroying archeological materials, please report this to park rangers.",
