A healthy ecosystem is a place where people, animals, plants, and natural processes interact in ways that support life within an historic range of variability. The living and nonliving components of the ecosystem are often connected in ways that are obscure, or are very complex and unexpected. Science (both western science and local knowledge) is essential in understanding these connections. By focusing research and monitoring on vital resources within an ecosystem, Park biologists and cooperating scientists can provide management with crucial information on current conditions and long-term trends of these vital resources. This will help ensure that the ecosystems are sustained for future generations.  Select 'Vital Resources' marked in red on the ecosystem graphic below for more information. You can also select vital resources from the list at the bottom of the page.               Vital Resources  Landscape Dynamics - Vegetation - Permafrost - Caribou - Dall's Sheep - Fire - Brown Bears - People - Birds      Connecting Further  Conducting Research in Gates of the Arctic Published Research ARCN Newsletter  Western Arctic Caribou Herd Working Group",
