Day or night, sky-watching is a great way to escape the world! Stop at one of the several overlooks on the Park road or take a short walk away from the traffic noise to watch the clouds and see weather forming before your eyes. The visual horizon in many places in the Summit area is up to 115 miles (185km) out to sea. Even cloudy skies can offer amazing sights including rainbows, moonbows and halos seen around your shadow. With world-class night sky conditions, Haleakalā also offers one of the most easily accessible places to watch planets, stars and moons after dark. Rent a pair of 10x50 or 7x50 binoculars at one of the island dive shops, pick up a star map at the Park Headquarters Visitor Center or the Haleakalā Visitor Center, and see if you can find the moons of Jupiter. Sunrise and sunset can be beautiful from the summit - they can also be very cold and wet. Find out more about mountain weather before you come.",
