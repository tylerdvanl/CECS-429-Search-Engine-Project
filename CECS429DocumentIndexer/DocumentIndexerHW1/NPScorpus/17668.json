    "body": "Climate Change        Photo credit to Drew Shinnick   Â    As a result of global warming, our Earth's changing climate will continue to profoundly alter national parks including Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Extreme heat waves, droughts, more wildland fires, coastal flooding and erosion, and other forms of habitat destruction are among possible scenarios in the coming decades. The National Park Service and Golden Gate National Recreation Area are taking action to reduce our greenhouse gas contributions, to educate staff and visitors about the problem and its solutions, and to develop new land management strategies in the face of coming changes.  Here at Golden Gate, we address these issues in a Climate Change Action Plan. The 20-year plan has three concrete objectives: 1) Reducing greenhouse gas emissions 2) Educating the public (and ourselves) 3) Monitoring climate change and adapting to its effects The Action Plan has a major component designed specifically for visitors who come to the Park in person or visit on-line. It's called DO YOUR PART! At the DO YOUR PART PARKS! web site you can join many other park visitors and stewards in confronting this world-wide threat by taking action to reduce your carbon footprint to protect your favorite parks. Read more about the overall National Park Service response to climate change at the NPS Climate Change website. Find out how other national parks are affected by climate change.
