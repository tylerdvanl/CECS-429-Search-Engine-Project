NPS photo   Â    Winter at Arches is a peaceful time, without the crowds or scorching heat that can plague summertime visits. Ice, snow, and reduced park operations, however, can provide their own challenges for winter visitors. Activities Ranger-led hikes or campfire talks are not offered in winter. The park orientation film plays on request at Arches Visitor Center, which is open seven days a week from 9 am to 4 pm. (closed December 25). Trail Conditions Most hiking trails remain open year-round. After a snowfall, popular trails like Delicate Arch quickly become slippery from packed snow and ice; traction devices and trekking poles are recommended. Drifting snow can cover trail markers, making even \"easy\" trails harder to follow. Updated photographs of trail conditions are usually on display at the visitor center and on Facebook. Road Conditions After a snowfall, the park road might be closed for several hours for plowing. Park roads, parking lots, and pullouts can still be icy, especially in shaded areas. Camping Sites at Devils Garden Campground are available, first-come, first-served, November through February. Drinking water and restrooms are provided at the campground; firewood is available for purchase at Arches Visitor Center bookstore. Water It is important to stay well-hydrated when visiting the desert, even in winter. Drinking water is available at the visitor center, Devils Garden picnic area, and Devils Garden Campground. The faucet at Devils Garden Trailhead is disabled during the winter. Read more about safety.",
