    "body": "Hunting       People can hunt in Noatak National Preserve, which is not typical for national park units. However, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) states that local people will be able to hunt, fish, trap and gather plant foods on this public land. It protects an 11,000 year old subsistence way of life. The term \"preserve\" also allows for non-local people to hunt. Non-local hunters can harvest wildlife in Noatak National Preserve according to Alaska state hunting regulations. Please keep in mind that many areas within the preserve are private land. Do not enter private land without the landowner's permission. As of July 1, 2016, the caribou hunt is closed to all non-federally qualified users. More information about the caribou hunt closure can be found in the news release or by calling the Northwest Arctic Heritage Center at 907-442-3890. The National Park Service and the State of Alaska cooperatively manage the wildlife resources of the Preserve. An Alaska state hunting license is required for all hunters age 16 or older. Bag and possession limits vary by species and by area. Always check current hunting regulations. Check out a list of businesses authorized to guide visitors in Noatak.
