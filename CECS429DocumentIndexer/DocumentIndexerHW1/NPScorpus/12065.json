Please remember to carry and drink plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months.

Tent, RV, and group sites are available.     Ranger Programs    Ranger talks, guided hikes, and evening programs are offered each spring on the east side of the park. Night programs are occasionally offered on weekends in spring, summer, and fall months. Rock Climbing  There are hundreds of routes on both sides of the park. If you've never climbed at Pinnacles, be sure to read our climber's safety advisory. You'll also want to check our raptor advisory page for information on routes that are under adisory to protect nesting prairie and peregrine falcons. Talus Caves  There are two talus caves at Pinnacles: the Bear Gulch Cave is closer to the east parking areas, and the Balconies Cave is closer to the west entrance. Check the status of the caves before you plan your visit.         Bird Watching From the California Condor to the Acorn Woodpecker, birding can be very productive at Pinnacles National Park.
