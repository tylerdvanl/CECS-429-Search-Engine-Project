There is much here for you to experience as you discover the rich history that Roanoke Island has hosted over the centuries. Learn about the courage of early English colonists as they left the comforts of England for the unknowns of the \"New World,\" glimpse into the Algonquian culture—the native population the English encountered—who tended crops and fished in the surrounding sounds, and celebrate the freedom that former slaves found here during the American Civil War. Come visit and see for yourself why Roanoke Island has drawn so many people to it. We look forward to seeing you out in the park!         Dave Hallac Superintendent, Outer Banks Group",
