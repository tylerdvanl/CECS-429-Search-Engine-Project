Instead, the park headquarters and visitor center are located in the village of Kotzebue, Alaska, 80 miles to the southwest. The Northwest Arctic Heritage Center provides visitors with park information, orientation and advice about travel logistics, and bear-resistant food containers are available for loan. It's also home to a museum about the Arctic ecosystem and Inupiaq culture. The center houses a great bookstore in cooperation with Alaska Geographic, and park rangers run a variety of public programs for both adults and children. Come and take a virtual tour.
