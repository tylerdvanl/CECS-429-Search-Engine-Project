    "body": "Bird Checklist       Capitol Reef National Park contains nearly a quarter million acres within the slickrock country of southern Utah. The birdlife is diverse because of a variety of habitats such as pinyon-juniper, perennial streams, dry washes and rock cliffs.   Lists and details of the birds seen by visitors are solicited, as this adds immeasurably to the value of the park's records. Common names conform with the A. 0. U. Checklist of North American Birds (Seventh Edition, 1998).   Below is the complete checklist for Capitol Reef National Park. The checklist can be downloaded and printed by clicking on the image.",
