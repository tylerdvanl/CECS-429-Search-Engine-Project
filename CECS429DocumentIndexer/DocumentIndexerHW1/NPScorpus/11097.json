NPS Photo \/ Sarah McGann   Â    From Superintendent's Compendium:  The following structures and\/or sales areas are closed to pets: The Heritage (visitor) Center, Historic Depot area (gatehouse, kitchen, Great Hall, canoe warehouse, Ojibwe village, voyageurs encampment, restrooms, Rendezvous historic encampment). \"Guide\" or \"service\" dogs for seeing impaired or physically disabled persons are permitted within all park facilities.  Notes of caution:  A \"leash law\" exists in the Grand Portage community. The Monument recommends the use of leash where pets are allowed within the Monument, such as in the picnic area and on trails. Sunny summer days include intense sunlight which can heat vehicles up very quickly. Pets can overheat rapidly in closed vehicles possibly resulting in life threatening heat exhaustion or heat stroke. If you choose to leave your pet in your vehicle during your visit to Grand Portage, please provide for adequate ventilation and water in your vehicle and plan regular return visits to monitor your pet's condition. Your pet(S) will thank you for your caution.  Dispose of pet waste:  All pet waste must be removed from the park. Pet waste may not be left on the ground. If you are visiting with your pet, please remember to bring plastic bags or a scoop and determine how you will transport waste from the park. The park also provides courtesy dog litter bag stations along the walkways. Once you've picked up your dog's waste with the plastic litter bag, you may dispose of it in a dog litter bag station or in any outdoor trash can. Cleaning up after your dog is the responsible thing to do and is the law in most areas. Unpicked pet waste can transmit disease to children and other pets. Dogs smell it, roll in it, walk in it, even ingest it. And, oftentimes, children and other pets pick up serious diseases from it. Animal feces are one of the most common sources of the following diseases: giardia, roundworms, salmonella, Ecoli, parvovirus and coronavirus.
