Please be aware that ranger program schedules and visitor center hours of operation change throughout the year. Once you have explored these pages, contact us via the park information line (435-719-2100) or via email if you have further questions regarding your trip logistics.    Apply for an Entrance Fee Waiver  Canyonlands collects a park entrance fee, but education groups may apply to have that fee waived. Fee waivers do not affect campground or permit fees that a group may incur.    Attend a Ranger Program  Spring through fall, ranger programs are offered to the public on a regular schedule. There is no need to pre-register for short guided walks, patio talks or campground talks. At this time, we cannot accommodate requests for special private tours.    Go Hiking  Non-commercial educational groups may hike together on all park trails. For groups larger than ~20 people, breaking into smaller groups is appreciated by other hikers.    Camp in a Campground The Needles Squaw Flat Campground offers three campsites for groups of 11 or more people that may be reserved in advance. Additional sites at Needles or Island in the Sky's Willow Flats Campground are available first-come, first-served. Educational fee-waivers do not affect these fees.   Explore Canyonlands' Backcountry  Non-commercial educational groups may also obtain a permit to occupy a backcountry campsite. Educational fee-waivers do not affect these permit fees.    Manage an Outdoor Classroom Successfully teaching outdoors requires all the skills of the classroom, plus some additional considerations.",
