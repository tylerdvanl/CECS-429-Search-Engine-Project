The Heritage Center and Education Center are wheelchair accessible. Wheelchairs, assisted listening devices, and special assistance are available upon request at both facilities. All video is open captioned. Service animals are welcome.  In honor of the accessibility work done here, the monument received a National Park Service National Accessibility Achievement Award for \"Interpretive Design Project Achievement- Making Exhibits and Waysides Accessible.\" The monument also received the James D. Walker Memorial Award, from the National Federation of the Blind of Nebraska, for the Heritage Center's audio description system.  All wayside exhibit signs along the hiking trails are audio described using our cell phone tour phone number (402-715-9527). Beside each wayside sign is a small placard with the cell phone tour stop number in Braille. The hiking trails consist of crushed rock and\/or mowed grass, and have moderate inclines in places. There are hard-surfaced sidewalk paths from the Heritage Center to the Palmer-Epard cabin and from the Education Center across the Cub Creek walking bridge.
