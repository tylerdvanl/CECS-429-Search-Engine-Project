Our hope is to lead new stewards into fulfilling and meaningful careers. Pathways for Youth begins with hands-on education for young people in the natural environment of Olympic National Park. Interpretive programs tailored to every age group address topics such as climate change, which have implications on a global scale. Students who have developed a solid foundation and interest in the resources of Olympic can complete their senior culminating projects for graduation at our park.      National Park Service Call to Action    Wilderness School    Marine Debris Ambassadors    Adopt A Trail Youth Crew      Our volunteer internships are designed to teach job skills for recent high school graduates and college students. Completing multiple Pathways programs will equip young people with the experience and knowledge necessary to compete for open employment opportunities with the National Park Service (at USA Jobs) and other employers.",
