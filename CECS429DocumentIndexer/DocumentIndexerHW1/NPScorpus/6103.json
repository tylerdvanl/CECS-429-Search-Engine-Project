You might just be surprised at what you learn!         Bessie Coleman First Female African American Pilot, 1893–1926 On June 15, 1921, Bessie Coleman became the first African American woman issued a pilot license. Rejected from U.S. flight schools because of racial and sexual prejudices, she learned to fly in France. Returning home, Coleman worked for equality in the air and on the ground, inspiring a generation of African American men and women.         Amelia Earhart First to Fly Solo Across Two Oceans, 1897–1937 Earhart, a noted aviation pioneer, was the first woman to receive the US Distinguished Flying Cross, and an early supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment. As a woman who did what few women—or men—dared to do, she became a representative icon of a woman breaking out of traditional roles.         The Tuskegee Airmen Colonel George Robers and General Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. The Tuskegee Airmen overcame racial descrimination during World War II. Roberts (left) was the first African American accepted into the military's pilot training program and the first Arican American officer to command a racially-mixed unit. Davis was the fourth African American graduate from West Point and the first African American general in the Army Air Forces.      Obtaining the cards Thank you for your interest in the National Park Service Civil War to Civil Rights Trading Card program for Cape Hatteras National Seashore, Fort Raleigh National Historic Site, and Wright Brothers National Memorial.
