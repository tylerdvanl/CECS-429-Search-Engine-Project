The spirit of hope that inspired these Practical Christians is evident in the town's name — Hopedale — which they chose for their fledgling experiment in communal living. Much like the 1960s, the 1840s were a time when many people questioned the moral authority of the existing establishment and sought to achieve modern Utopias by restructuring society along communal lines. During the 1840s, Henry David Thoreau withdrew to his cabin on Walden Pond, while Transcendentalists such as Emerson and the Alcotts experimented with communal living at Brook Farm and Fruitlands. The original Hopedale community was the most enduring of these communal societies, outliving the better known Brook Farm by a decade.      Jump to Introduction 2 Factory Site 3 Little Red Shop 4 The Parklands 5 Dutcher Street Company Housing 6 Unitarian Church and Town Hall 7 Bancroft Memorial Library        Hopedale Walking Tour Map",
