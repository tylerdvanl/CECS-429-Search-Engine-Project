Come celebrate the National Park Service centennial in 2016 with the Every Kid in a Park program, or explore the PHT network by region with our regional itineraries below. Every Kid in a Park – Calling All Fourth Graders! We need your help to celebrate the National Park Service turning 100 years old in 2016! If you are 10 years old or in fourth grade, the National Park Service needs you to act as an important ambassador to introduce your family to the National Park System. This initiative, known as the Every Kid in a Park program, runs until August 30, 2016, giving fourth graders and their families free entrance to federal lands and waters across America. Parents, check out how it works. Fourth graders, find out how to receive your free 4th Grade Annual Pass. For more information about the program, visit the Every Kid in a Park website.
