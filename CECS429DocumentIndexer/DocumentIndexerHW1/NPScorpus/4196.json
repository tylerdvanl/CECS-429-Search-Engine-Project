    "body": "Geocaching              Geocaching is a real-world outdoor treasure hunt. Players locate hidden containers, called geocaches, using GPS-enabled devices and share their experiences online. If you are new to geocaching, you may want to begin by checking out the official Guide to the Game.  Players may register a free account with Geocaching.com to seek caches and log entries about those they've found, but it is not necessary. The information needed to find Everglades Restoration Geocaches is freely available on these pages.            Park Employee for a Day Geocache Trail         Ready to step into the shoes of our park employees, and try YOUR hand at managing Everglades National Park?
