(174 km) long waterway that lies in the northern part of Bering Land Bridge National Preserve. It starts nears Cloud Lake at an elevation of 1,258 ft. (383 m) and flows northeast into Goodhope Bay in the Chukchi Sea. Most of the river moves slowly and flows through low-lying tundra. It contains a variety of fish, including salmon, Dolly Varden, and white fish. High concentrations of waterfowl and shorebirds use the river and seabirds nest at its mouth in Goodhope Bay.         Serpentine River Midnight Mountain, near Serpentine Hot Springs, is the starting point for the 35 mile (56 km) long Serpentine River. It flows into Shishmaref Inlet by way of a very windy, or serpentine, course, which gives it its name. The river flows through a tundra covered landscape, with willows and other shrubs lining its banks. Numerous geologic landforms are found along the rivers path to the sea, including thermal springs, granite outcrops and spires, and elongated, rounded ridges and hills.         Kuzitrin River The Kuzitrin River is a slow moving, 95 mile (153 km) long river on the Seward Peninsula. It starts with Kuzitrin Lake, located in Bering Land Bridge National Preserve, and flows southwest into Imuruk Basin. The basin empties into the Bering Sea via the bay of Port Clarence. Several fish species are found in the river, including northern pike, whitefish, grayling, and five species of salmon. Moose depend on land surrounding the river for winter habitat.",
