From the 308th step at the historic lighthouse to high up on Mt. Vision's bishop pine covered ridge, the public was invited to share their favorite memories of this natural sanctuary. Park visitors were invited to submit their photos in three categories: flora and fauna, landscapes, and people in the seashore. The competition was open to all park visitors. Submissions were accepted between August 1, 2012, and August 31, 2012. The winners were announced in September 2012 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the park.",
