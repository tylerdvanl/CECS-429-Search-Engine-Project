Although campsites are available on a first come, first served basis, you can reserve sites at the Cougar Rock and Ohanapecosh Rock campgrounds by visiting the Recreation.gov web site.  If you plan to use the group sites at Cougar Rock or Ohanapecosh campgrounds between Memorial Day weekend and Columbus Day, you must make reservations. NOTE: Marijuana on Federal lands: Mount Rainier National Park would like provide clarification regarding the use and possession of marijuana on Federal lands. The recently passed Washington State law, which allows for limited recreational marijuana use under certain conditions, has no bearing on Federal laws which continue to identify marijuana as a Schedule I illegal drug, and prohibit its use. More information posted on current conditions page.        CAMPGROUND REGULATIONS  Campsite Limits  Camp in designated campsites only. Sleeping in vehicles outside of campgrounds is not permitted. Campsites are limited to a maximum of 6 persons (or immediate family) and two tents. All vehicles must be parked within the designated campsite parking area and not beyond the barriers or on vegetation. There are special sites designated for group tent camping. Camping is limited to 14 consecutive days in any developed campground within the park and no more than 28 days total in any designated campground within the calendar year.   Length of Stay  A 14-day camping limitation applies to all camping.   Fires  Keep fires small and within the closed grating provided. Do not burn trash or leave trash in the grate. Do not leave fires unattended. Buy It Where You Burn It! Firewood brought in from other areas may contain invasive insect species that pose a serious threat to Mount Rainier National Park's resources... Please leave your firewood at home.   - Buy firewood near where you will burn it- that means the wood was cut within 50 miles of where you'll have your fire. - Wood that looks clean and healthy can still have tiny insect eggs, or microscopic fungi spores, that will start a new and deadly infestation. Always leave it at home, even if you think the firewood looks fine. - Aged or seasoned wood is still not safe. Just because it is dry doesn't mean that bugs can't crawl onto it! - Tell you friends not to bring wood with them- everyone needs to know that they should not move firewood.     Firewood may be purchased from private wood concessionaires at the Longmire General Store, Cougar Rock, Ohanapecosh, and White River Campgrounds. See campground bulletin boards for more information. Do not collect firewood, branches, twigs or cones. As these materials decompose they nourish the trees and preserve the quality of the forest.   Pets  Dogs, cats and other pets must be caged, on a leash (no longer than 6 feet) or otherwise under physical restraint at all times. Pets may not be left unattended or tied to trees. Pets are not permitted in amphitheaters or buildings, or on vegetated areas or trails. Pets are permitted only in parking lots and roads open to vehicles. Learn more about pets in the park.   Vehicles  All vehicles (cars, trucks, RVs, tent-trailers and utility trailers) must be parked on the gravel or paved area of your site and not beyond the barriers. If you plan to leave your vehicle for more than 24 hours but will be staying in the park, inform the campground ranger of your plans so that your vehicle will not be considered abandoned property. No utilities or connections of any kind are available.   Bicycles, Motorbikes, Roller Skates, Skateboards  Bicycles and motorbikes may be operated in the campground on roadways only, in the same direction of travel as other vehicles. Motorcycles must be licensed for street use and drivers must have an operators license. Travel on trails with bicycles or motorbikes is not permitted. The use of wheeled vehicles (such as skateboards, roller skates, roller blades, scooters, etc.) is not permitted in the park. Learn more about bicycling in the park.   Natural Features  To preserve the natural features of the park, driving nails into trees and creating ditches around tents are not permitted. Do not feed any wildlife (including birds) in the park. Human food can cause digestive problems and can result in an animal's death or in injury to you. Keep Wildlife Wild!  Picking or cutting flowers, gathering or digging plants and trees are not permitted. Collecting rocks or other materials is prohibited.   Sanitation  RV sink drains must empty into containers which may be emptied into service sinks or toilets only. Do not use water fountains or spigots for cleaning purposes. Wash dishes in a container at your campsite. Dump used water in camp sink located at the restrooms. RV dump stations located at the Cougar Rock and Ohanapecosh campgrounds are available for your use at no cost.   Quiet Hours  Quiet hours are between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m. Keep noise to a minimum at all times and show respect for others.   Generator Hours  Generators may only be used between the following hours: 8 a.m. to 10 a.m., noon to 2 p.m., and 5 p.m. to 7 p.m..
