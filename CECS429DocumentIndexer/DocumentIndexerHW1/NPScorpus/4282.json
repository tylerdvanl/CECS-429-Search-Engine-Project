However, park staff will be reviewing and updating this list in the coming weeks as all of the data sheets turned in by BioBlitz participants are reviewed. Be sure to check back for updated information and final details about the interesting finds that were made in Biscayne National Park.  Â    Other BioBlitz Media  The National Park Service and the National Geographic Society held the Biscayne BioBlitz on April 30 and May 1, 2010. Teams of scientists, naturalists, community leaders, students, and the public joined forces to discover and inventory every living plant and creature in and out of the water at Biscayne National Park.  During this event, Biscayne National Park and National Geographic posted images of the BioBlitz to photo galleries, blogged, and sent out updates via Twitter. They also kept track of the plant species identified by BioBlitz participants. So, if you didn't attend the BioBlitz in person, be sure to follow the event virtually through these options.",
