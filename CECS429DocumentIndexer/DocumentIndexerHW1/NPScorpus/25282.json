The miners traveled from all over the country and the world, to risk their  lives in the uncharted land of the preserve. For over forty years, miners moved mostly without interruption into the interior of the peninsula, searching for the elusive and profitable gold mining claim. On October 8th, 1942, the War Production Board, with the intention of promoting national defense, ordered the closer of all  non-essential mines. The board allowed smaller mines to continue operating, but the war had basically  stopped most gold mining on the peninsula. Although the order was revoked in 1945, gold mining was never able to reach the same level of importance as before the war. The Humbolt Creek mining claim was on of the last gold mining placers in the preserve. A national park or  preserve may contain unpatented or patented mining claims from before its establishment, but no new mining claims are allowed in any park or preserve. After the creation of the preserve, seventy-nine unpatented and inactive claims were located within preserve boundaries. Eventually all gold mining within the preserve ceased. Currently, the preserve does not contain any unpatented or patented claims. A cabin built in the 1930s, still stands at the location of the Humbolt Creek Mining Camp. The abandoned camp now sits as a small reminder of the history of gold mining in the preserve.",
