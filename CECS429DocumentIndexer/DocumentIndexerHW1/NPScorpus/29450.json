    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Safety            Safety       The museum and historic church are safe.Visitors should observe normal procedures of walking slowly and being careful around exhibit cases.In the church, the guided tour often accesses the second floor balcony overhang, and here a special note of caution is in order.The front railing or border of the gallery is quite low by modern standards, and visitors should be especially careful at that point.If the tour includes the Bell Tower, please be mindful and respectful of all safety precautions communicated by our staff.Outside, we advise visitors to recognize they are walking through a historic cemetery, with some patches of uneven ground.Be mindful that some of the ground stones are as low as six inches off the ground;please be careful to avoid tripping. Seasonally, there might be an occasional animal hole, although our staff would normally mark it off with a flag of some sort.Please don't climb onto the mounds of the vaults.",
