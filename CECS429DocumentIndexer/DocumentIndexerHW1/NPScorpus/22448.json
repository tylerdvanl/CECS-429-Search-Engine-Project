    "body": "Field Trips      A field trip to the Natchez Trace Parkway will provide an opportunity for your students to be immersed in Parkway resources, and have experiences that can not be replicated in the classroom. All field trips are free of charge, and are scheduled based on ranger availability. Please have alternate days ready when scheduling your trip. Bus parking and restrooms are available at most locations. We may be able to tailor a field trip to meet your needs. If a field trip is not possible for your class, a ranger may be available to visit your classroom. Field trips build real experience and lasting memories. To schedule a field trip, please call 662-680-4027.",
