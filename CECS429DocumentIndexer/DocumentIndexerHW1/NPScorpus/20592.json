    "body": "Planning       A new national trail takes shape through careful planning. In this planning section of the trail's website, you can view and download all of the plans created so far, and learn of upcoming opportunities to get involved with aspects of trail development.  Wide participation is essential throughout the trail planning process. Input from the public at workshops, consultations, and through the Planning, Environment, and Public Comment website (PEPC) helps guide the National Park Service in finding the best methods to manage, interpret, and access the trail.  Five planning documents have been completed with public participation since the trail's designation by Congress in December, 2006. You can read about them on the following webpages:  Comprehensive management plan and environmental assessment (2011)   James River Segment Plan (2013) Potomac River Segment Plan (2015)   Interpretive Plan (2010) Conservation Strategy (2013)  In June 2016, a non-profit organization The Conservation Fund purchased the historic site of Werowocomoco from willing land owners and transferred the property to the National Park Service. The Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail will manage the property. A planning process will be underway with partners to determine how best to protect the site and plan for visitor experiences in the future. The public will be invited to comment as planning proceeds.
