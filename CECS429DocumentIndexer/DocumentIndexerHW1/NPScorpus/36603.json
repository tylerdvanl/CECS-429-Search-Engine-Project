    "body": "Traffic & Travel Tips        Between March and October, it can be difficult to find parking. NPS\/Andrew Kuhn       To avoid long lines at the entrance gate and parking congestion, plan your visit before 8 am or after 3 pm. Late afternoon and evening visits can be the most enjoyable. The lighting is better for photography and viewing the park features, temperatures are cooler, and the parking areas and trails are less crowded. More than 1.4 million visitors come to Arches National Park each year, and that number is growing. Between March and October, you can expect limited parking at all destinations. Parking at popular trailheads like The Windows, Delicate Arch, and Devils Garden are usually full most of the day.  There are a few alternatives to driving your car in Arches, but if you're planning to drive, then this page is for you.        When the Park is Busiest  From March through October, visitation at Arches is extremely high. The following holidays and weekends are especially busy:  Easter week (date varies - usually in April) Memorial Day (last Monday in May) Labor Day (first Monday in September) Utah Education Association break (4 days in October, visit www.myuea.org for details)         This chart shows the daily vehicle entrances into Arches National Park throughout the year. Times of heavy visitation include Easter week, Memorial Day, Labor Day, and Utah Education Association (UEA) weekend. NPS        Entering the Park  During high visitation, there may be significant delays entering the park, and once inside, you can expect increased travel times and congestion along the scenic drive. Long lines may form at the entrance gate.  If the entrance road is backed up, you may not stop on the highway: it is against the law. (Utah Code 41-6a-1401) Come back at another time, or consider visiting other nearby attractions.

View webcam                Where the Crowds Are  Parking lots at popular trailheads and viewpoints such as Devils Garden, Delicate Arch, and The Windows are usually full between 9 am and 4 pm.  When parking lots are full, please remember:  Park in designated areas only. Do not drive off roads. If a lot is full, do not wait for spots to open; move on, and try again later. More Places to Go Never park on vegetation or in a manner that blocks traffic. Don't block the flow of traffic by waiting for a parking spot.  If you do find a parking spot and go for a hike, expect to see a lot of other people on the trail. It is not uncommon for hundreds of people to visit Delicate Arch at sunset.        How to Avoid the Crowds  Avoid visiting on the holidays\/weekends listed above. Early morning (sunrise) is always less busy than sunset. To beat the crowds, try entering the park before 8 am. You may encounter groups of early-morning photographers at some destinations. Carpool if you can. Consider hiring a company to shuttle you to and from the park (visit www.discovermoab.com to see what's available). Parking for oversize vehicles (RVs, trailers) is extremely limited. Leave oversized vehicles in town, or in the visitor center parking lot.
