This agreement was later ratified by four other engineering societies: the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, and the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers. Appropriate subjects for documentation are individual sites or objects, such as a bridge, ship, or steel works; or larger systems, like railroads, canals, electronic generation and transmission networks, parkways and roads. HAER documented Skyline Drive in 1996, producing eighteen sheets of drawings which are available at the Library of Congress web site, http:\/\/hdl.loc.gov\/loc.pnp\/hhh.va1798.
