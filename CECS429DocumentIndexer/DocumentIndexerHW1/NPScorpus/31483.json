It stands proudly as the oldest unrestored stone church in America. In its heyday, colorful geometric designs covered its surface, but the patterns have long since faded or been worn away. However, original frescos are still visible in several of the rooms.     Learn more about Mission Concepción. It is located at 807 Mission Road, San Antonio, Texas, 78210.",
