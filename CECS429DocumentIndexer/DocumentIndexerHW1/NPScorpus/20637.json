What's geocaching? A geocache (pronounced \"geo-cash\") is a hidden treasure that one locates by using a GPS device. Geocaching is for adventure seekers all around the world who want to get outside and play. A geotrail. like the Captain John Smith geotrail, is a series of geocaches linked by a common theme or topic.    Our geotrail was designed and created by volunteer geocachers from the Maryland Geocaching Society, working with the Chesapeake Conservancy and the National Park Service. Geocaches were placed at more than 40 sites on five rivers representing particular stories or scenes from John Smith's adventures on the Bay 400 years ago. When you visit 15 of these sites, and record a codeword in your CJS Geotrail Passport, you will recieve a distinctive and collectible CJS Geocoin. Download the CJS Geotrail Passport.
