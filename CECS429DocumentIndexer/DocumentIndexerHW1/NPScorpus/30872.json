Tour Request Form (PDF Format)   Â    Permits A Special Use Permit is required for any activity that provides a benefit to an individual, group, or organization rather than the park or the public at large. Many of the events that require permits also require some degree of oversight from National Park Service staff. First Amendment Activities  We encourage citizens to exercise rights guaranteed by the Constitution. However, the courts have recognized that activities associated with the exercise of these rights may be reasonably regulated to protect the public and park resources. Therefore, such First Amendment activities involving over 25 participants require special use permits and National Park Service staff may regulate the time, place, and manner in which they are conducted. Some examples are:  distribution and\/or sale of printed matter religious services public demonstrations or assemblies, etc. collecting signatures for petitions  Commercial Filming and Photography A Commercial Filming\/Still Photography Permit is required for any filming or photography done by photojournalists, other members of the media, and all commercial entities within the boundary of General Grant National Memorial.
