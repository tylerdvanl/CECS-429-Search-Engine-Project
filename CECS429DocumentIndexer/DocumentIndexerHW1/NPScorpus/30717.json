    "body": "Environmental Factors       Many environmental factors face the National Park Service, Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial, and the Great Lakes Region. These factors include Non-native species such as Zebra Mussels, Emerald Ash Bore, and Asian Carp; climate change, and pollution to name a few.  Â       Great Lakes Restoration Initiative The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is the largest investment in the Great Lakes in two decades. A task force of 11 federal agencies developed an action plan to implement the initiative. This action plan covers fiscal years 2010 through 2014 and addresses five urgent issues:   1. Cleaning up toxics and areas of concern; 2. Combating invasive species; 3. Promoting nearshore health by protecting watersheds from polluted run-off; 4. Restoring wetlands and other habitats; and 5. Tracking progress and working with strategic partners. More information about the GLRI can be found here.",
