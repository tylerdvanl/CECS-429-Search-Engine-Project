The web site will include text and images but will feature videos that, not only illustrates the many Illinois places that relate to the slavery to freedom story but also gain reaction from young people as they learn about these stories and places. The goal of the project is to teach history, but also to inspire youth by presenting stories of victory through adversity.               NPS Photo  The Illinois Freedom Project partners are committed to encourage Illinois youth organizations to visit the many historic sites and museums in Illinois that relate to the story of freedom in Illinois and beyond.               Illinois Freedom Summit participants, January 2015.
