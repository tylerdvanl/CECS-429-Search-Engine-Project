Locally, these aquifers provide minor amounts of water for domestic and livestock use.  The initial flow of the major streams within the seven-county area comes from seeps and springs, primarily from the Edwards-Trinity aquifer.  Groundwater in the area is generally available from the strata of Hickory Sandstone, Ellenburger Limestone, Hensell Sand and Edwards Limestone.",
