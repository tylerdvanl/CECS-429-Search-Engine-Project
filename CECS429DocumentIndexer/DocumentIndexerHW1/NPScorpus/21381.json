Expedition to Polly Creek  July 27, 2015 Posted by: Sam Stark  0 Comments     We’ve come to Polly Creek for the same reason people have come to this remote coast of Lake Clark National Park for almost 100 years: It is loaded with razor clams. Unlike the other boats full sport fisherman and commercial clammers landing on the beach today, however, we aren’t here to harvest, we are here to study. Our work is part of the Changing Tides Project, a multi-year study looking at the link between coastal brown bears and marine intertidal invertebrates.",
