NPS photo  Latest News of the Friendship of Salem The Friendship of Salem left Derby Wharf for a scheduled “haul-out” on July 5, 2016. A haul-out is where a ship is removed from the water to perform inspections, repairs and routine maintenance that are only possible when the vessel is out of the water. Friendship of Salem will be repaired by Boothbay Harbor Shipyard and Gloucester Marine Railways Corporation on Rocky Neck in Gloucester, Massachusetts. When all inspections and repairs are complete she will return. The purpose of the estimated 12 week contract is to perform a variety of maintenance, inspection and repair work including:   • Cleaning, inspection, repairs, and painting of the hull below the waterline;    • Painting of portions of the hull and attachments above the waterline;    • Inspection, cleaning and maintenance on propellers, shafts, rudder and other running gear components; and,    • Repair of a deteriorated hull section on starboard side near the base of the foremast.   We hope that the Friendship will return to Derby Wharf by November 2016. For more information please visit our Facebook page.   The Salem East Indiaman Friendship was launched in 1797. She made 15 voyages during her career to Batavia, India, China, South America, the Caribbean, England, Germany, the Mediterranean, and Russia. Built for the Salem mercantile firm Waite and Peirce in the South River shipyard of Enos Briggs, she ended her activities as an American merchant vessel when she was captured as a prize of war by the British Sloop of War HMS Rosamond in September 1812. The replica of Friendship was built by the National Park Service using modern materials and construction methods while retaining the appearance of the original ship.         Sea chests were used by both officers and sailors as secure places to store their personal belongings. NPS photo  The Crew of an East Indiaman The captain, or master, of a vessel had absolute power of command aboard ship. He was legally accountable for every aspect of the operation of the ship, the activities of her crew and the safe delivery of all cargo entrusted to his care. The great cabin, located at the stern of the ship, was the captain's private space, office and dining room.        The forecastle (or fo'c'sle) was the sailor's quarters. NPS photo  Aboard merchant and whaling ships, bunks were provided for the crew in the living area called the forecastle in the bow of the ship. Although damp, poorly ventilated and sometimes stifling or freezing, the arrangement was more comfortable than the hammocks and overcrowded conditions aboard naval vessels.      For more information: Download the Friendship of Salem site bulletin (128 KB pdf file) Issues of Salem Maritime’s occasional newsletter, Pickled Fish and Salted Provisions “Partners for Eternity” Volume 1, Number 7 (125 KB pdf file) “Figureheads” Volume 2, Number 3 (89 KB pdf file) “Tall Ships, Small Ships” Volume 2, Number 5 (70 KB pdf file) “Seaman's Clothing in Friendship's Era” Volume 3, Number 2 (113 KB pdf file) “Shoes, Ships, and Survival” Volume 3, Number 3 (379 KB pdf file) “Repeat Performance” Volume 3, Number 4 (coming soon) “Rats” Volume 3, Number 5 (coming soon) “Fire and Lights” Volume 3, Number 6 (127 KB pdf file) “Mary's Little Lamb” Volume 4, Number 3 (coming soon) “Walk Away With the Cat, Walk Away With the Fish” Volume 4, Number 4 (331 KB pdf file) “The Medicine Chest” Volume 6, Number 3 (228 KB pdf file) “The Arms Chest” Volume 7, Number 1 (136 KB pdf file) “The Great Age of Duck” Volume 7, Number 4 (916 KB pdf file) “What's In a Name?” Volume 8, Number 3 (539 KB pdf file) “Are We There Yet?” Volume 8, Number 4 (798 KB pdf file) “A Salem Clipper” Volume 8, Number 5 (4.8 M pdf file) “What Ship is That?” Volume 8, Number 6 (762 KB pdf file)",
