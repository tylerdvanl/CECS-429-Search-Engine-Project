    "body": "Stock Use       Meadow Opening and Closing Updates       NPS Photo       'Stock use' refers to travel with horses, mules, burros, and llamas. Since the U.S. Army Calvary protected the Park in the early 1890s, using stock to build roads, trails, and bridges, stock use has been an important element of Park operations and management. Not to mention the many visitors that benefit from stock-supported trips each year. However, stock use has impacts on wilderness environments, and as such, must be carefully planned and conducted. If you would like to travel with stock in wilderness, be sure you are familiar with the specific regulations that apply to stock-supported trips. The Wilderness Office is available to assist you. For information regarding commercial stock use, please contact the Commercial Services Office at 559-565-4235 or e-mail us.      Planning Your Stock-Supported Wilderness Trip   Read the 2016 Stock Users Guide and 2016 grazing maps for Sequoia and Kings Canyon.
