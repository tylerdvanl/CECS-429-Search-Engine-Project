Horseback riding is permitted only on trails signed and designated as horse trails. Horses need to be brought in as there are no horse rentals adjacent to the bridle trails in CVNP. Station Road parking lot, close to Brecksville Reservation, has large pull-through parking spaces that require little to no \"backing\" efforts. They are designed for horse trailers and buses. Boston Store overflow and Everett Road Covered Bridge parking lot were not designed for horse trailers, and while it is legal for them to park there, it is often a challenge to navigate. Enjoy your ride! Happy trails to you!  Click here to go to our maps webpage, where you can download and print the most current versions of our maps.
