    "body": "Doing Business in the Park       I run a bed and breakfast and want to bring my guests to the park. Do I need a special permit? The law requires anyone doing business in a park area, including transporting paying guests on a tour, to have an Incidental Business Permit or a concessions contract. I take still photos and sell them freelance to magazines - do I need a permit? Most commercial photography, both still and motion pictures, requires a permit, due to the potential impact of crews, equipment, shooting schedules, etc. on resources and other visitors. A single photographer with a hand held camera and no props, models, or crew probably does not need a permit. Commercial photographers should check with the park for exact requirements prior to shooting.",
