Ferry Fees Adult - $16 Child (11 and under) - $9         Reserve Your Place! :  Reservations are required for this trip. To make a reservation for programs in June or July this is a two step process.  First: Contact the Harkers Island Visitor Center at (252) 728-2250 ext. 3001 or calo_information.gov. We will send you essential trip information, answer your questions and take your reservation. Although there is no charge for the program, you will need to pay the ferry fee (see above).  Second: Call Island Express Ferry Service at (252) 728-RIDE (7433) to reserve your space on the ferry.  Tell them that you are participating in the horse program.  (Please do not reserve online as this is a special ferry trip.)    NOTE: By September, we expect to be using www.recreation.gov for reservations, but you can still call us now about the Fall trips.   Departure will be from the Cape Lookout Visitor Center on Harkers Island (GPS use: 1800 Island Rd, Harkers Island, NC 28531) or the Cape Lookout Visitor Information Center located in the Beaufort Town Hall (701 Front St., Beaufort, NC 28516).   Parking    In Beaufort, from Memorial Day to Labor Day, parking along Front Street and in the waterfront parking lots is paid parking.  Watch for spot numbers at the rear of the parking space and pay accordingly in kiosks on the sidewalks. Free parking is available in marked spaces on side streets.  On Harkers Island, parking in the Harkers Island Visitor Center lot is free.     Difficulty is moderate. The horses roam far and wide so we'll be walking to find them.  We will be climbing dune hills, walking in loose sand, ducking through shrubs and winding through prickly needlerush.  Trips from Harkers Island will likely include wading in salt water to our knees and slogging through heavy black marsh mud to our ankles.  We will walk at a moderate pace and then stand or sit to watch the horses.  In summer, be prepared for very high heat indexes -- dress in loose fitting clothes and bring extra water.  In autumn if it's cold we'll do our best not to get wet.  There are ticks on the island, so take normal precautions including a tick check when you get home.  Amenities on Shackleford Banks are few and not always handy, be prepared.  Visitors arriving from Beaufort may use the dock's vertical ladder to unload or load the boat.  They may also pass by the toilets (without washing facilities) on our walk.  Visitors arriving from Harkers Island will find no toilets but many bushes on Shackleford Banks.  The first steps off and to the boat may include wading.   Weather: Bad weather will only stop us if the ferry does not run.  To check ferry status, you may call the ferry after 7 am on the day of the trip. Footwear. Closed toe walking shoes are necessary to protect you feet from cacti, sand spurs and oysters. See the advisories about mud and salt water above under Difficulty. We advise bringing a change of socks and shoes for the drive home.  Remember to bring:    water and other drinks in a reclosable bottle    lunch & snacks   sturdy close-toed walking shoes that can get wet, salty & dirty and will protect from cactus, sand spurs & sharp oyster shells while wading (please no flip-flops)   hat   sunscreen   bug repellent (and do a tick check afterwards)   rain jacket (also for spray in the boat)   binoculars   camera with zoom (telephoto) lens   a change of socks & shoes for the drive home   daypack\/shoulder bag to carry these items (hard sided coolers are too heavy and cumbersome to carry)",
