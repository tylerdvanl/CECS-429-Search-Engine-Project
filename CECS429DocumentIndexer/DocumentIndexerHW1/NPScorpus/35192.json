These trees, apple, pear, peach, cherry, apricot, mulberry, even Potowatomee Plum, are the most obvious reminder of the pioneer community that once prospered in the narrow valley of the Fremont River. Other places of interest include the Fruita Schoolhouse and the Gifford Homestead. In these next few pages you can explore some of these places and learn the history behind them.",
