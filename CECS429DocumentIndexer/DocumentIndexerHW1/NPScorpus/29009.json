    "body": "Insects, Spiders, Centipedes, Millipedes       According to a recent odonate survey of Sagamore Hill, the site hosts at least twenty-one species of dragonflies and damselflies, which utilize a variety of habitats within the park.  Heron Pond, located in the eastern forest, had one of the highest species diversities for odonates in the entire park, with six species of dragonflies and two species of damselflies recorded at the site. These species included the parkâ€™s only recorded Twelve-spotted skimmer and Slender spread-wings. Three dragonflies and one damselfly were also recorded at the Woodpile Pond just north of the parking area. Two fields within the park also displayed high species abundance, with at least 10 species being found in each. These included one rare species, the Comet Darner (Anax Longipes). Five species of dragonflies have also been recorded within the estuarine complex at the eastern edge of the park. These include the only Seaside dragonlet recorded at Sagamore Hill, as well as Wandering and Spot-winged gliders.",
