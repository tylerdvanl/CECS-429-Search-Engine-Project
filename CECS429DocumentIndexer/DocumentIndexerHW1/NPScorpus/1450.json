In addition to laws and regulations that may apply in many areas of federal jurisdiction, there are park-specific rules intended to maintain public health and safety, protection of environmental or scenic values, provide for equitable use of facilities, protect natural and cultural resources, and avoid conflict among various visitor activities. While it is your responsibility to know and abide by all laws, rules and regulations of this national park, following are some of the more common questions or issues that arise. For a more complete list, refer to the links provided at the bottom of this page.  Dogs, Cats and Other Pets Rocky Mountain National Park is a designated natural area where wildlife is free to roam undisturbed. Park visitors should be able to enjoy native wildlife in their natural environment without the disruption or influence of domesticated animals. Pets may accompany you in developed areas such as campgrounds, parking areas and picnic sites but are not permitted on trails or away from roads or parking areas. Where permitted, pets must be under physical control at all times;caged, crated, or restrained by leash no longer than six feet.  It is prohibited to leave a pet unattended and tied to an object - It is also illegal to leave pets in a situation where food, water, shade, ventilation and other basic needs are inadequate. So while it is possible for pets to remain in your vehicle while you are viewing attractions near roads and parking areas, it is strongly recommended that a party member remain behind to personally ensure your pet's well-being.    Overnight Camping  Camping in the park is subject to a fee and is restricted to designated campgrounds or in the backcountry with an overnight wilderness permit. Permits are available at park Wilderness Permit and Information Offices. Campfires are only allowed in certain areas where metal fire rings are provided.    Cycling  Bicycles are permitted on all roads that are open to motor vehicles, both paved and dirt, unless otherwise posted. There are no designated bicycle lanes along roads.
