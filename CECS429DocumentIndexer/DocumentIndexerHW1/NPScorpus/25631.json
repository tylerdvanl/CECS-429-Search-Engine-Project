Camping in the arctic requires planning, preparation, and care in order to protect yourself and the fragile arctic ecosystem. Following Leave No Trace ethics helps ensure a successful camping experience.   Site Selection Arctic tundra is fragile and slow to recover. It is best to camp on durable surfaces.   Remember that water levels can rise at any time, so locate your camp well above current water levels. If you must choose a vegetated site, select a location with hardier vegetation such as grasses and sedges, rather than more fragile lichens and mosses. You can also help preserve the ecosystem by moving camp every 2-3 days or before signs of your presence becomes noticeable. Wearing soft-soled shoes around camp gives your feet and the vegetation a break.    Setting Up Camp Select a durable surface for your campsite. When camping on the tundra, select a site that is not too dry and that will not be heavily impacted. Keep in mind that you are in bear country. Be sure to practice backcountry bear safety. Bear barrels may be borrowed from the Bering Land Bridge Visitor Center in Nome, AK. When finished with a site, please return it to its natural state.    Cooking Gas or propane stoves for cooking are strongly recommended. Fires are often impractical. Tree growth in the arctic is very slow. In some areas wood is scarce or nonexistent. A gas or propane stove is also good for emergencies since it is easy to light.  Keep a clean camp. Avoid food spills and other animal attractants. Proper food storage is required in all Alaskan parks. Bears that become accustomed to human food and products present a hazard to people traveling in the backcountry and often have to be destroyed. We can all do our part to protect the fragile ecosystem while enjoying this vast wilderness.    Winter Camping Snow machines provide access to Bering Land Bridge in the winter when there is enough snow coverage and opportunities for winter camping. Be prepared for extreme winter conditions, such as cold winds and snowfall. Consider using high-quality gear, especially a good tent. Winter conditions may require you to cook inside your tent.",
