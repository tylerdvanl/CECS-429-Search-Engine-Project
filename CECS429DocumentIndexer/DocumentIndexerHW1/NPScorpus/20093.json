    "body": "Special Use Permits       Cumberland Island National Seashore is home to many beautiful cultural and natural settings which are ideal venues for a variety of special activities such as events, wedding ceremonies, and film and photography projects. Most special events and activities held in the park require a special use permit, issued only after the National Park Service (NPS) determines that the activities involved will not impair park values and resources. Please note that there are usage limits for the number of people for any special activity. Special Events  A special use permit is required for activities that provide a benefit to an individual, group, or organization rather than the public at large and that require some degree of management from the National Park Service to protect park resources and the public interest. Some examples of special events that require permits are:    non-competitive sporting events    public spectator attractions    festivals    concerts    ceremonies    cultural programs    Filming\/Photography    A photography\/filming permit is required for any filming or photography involving models, sets, or props. For more information about photography and filming permits, including restrictions and application procedures, see Photography and Filming.     Weddings    Many of the Park's settings are ideally suited for small, informal weddings. All weddings require an approved wedding special use permit.      First Amendment Activities   Freedom of speech, press, religion, and assembly are constitutional rights. However, the courts have recognized that activities associated with the exercise of these rights may be reasonably regulated to protect park resources. Therefore, all first amendment activities require special use permits and the NPS may regulate the time, place, and manner in which they are conducted. Some examples of special events that require permits are: distribution and\/or sale of printed matter religious services public demonstrations or assemblies, etc. collecting signature for petitions.      Miscellaneous Activities    Other activities may require permits if there is the potential for interference with visitor use, congestion of a highly visited area, or possible impact on park resources.     Weddings, Special Events, First Amendment Activities, and Applicable Miscellaneous Activities: To apply for a special use permit for these activities, download an application, fill it out, and send it to: Cumberland Island National Seashore 101 Wheeler Street St Marys, GA 31558 Attn: Special Use Permits  Special instructions are listed on the application form; please read carefully.
