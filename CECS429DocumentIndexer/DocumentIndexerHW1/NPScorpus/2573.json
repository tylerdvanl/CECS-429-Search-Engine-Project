Advance campground reservations can be made for two of the three NPS campgrounds within Grand Canyon National Park. The NPS campgrounds do not have RV hook-ups.   Mather Campground on the South Rim (in Grand Canyon Village open all year)    North Rim Campground. (a short season May 15 through October 31) From October 16 to October 31, there will be minimal services and depending on the weather, there may be no running water in the campground. Composting toilets will be available during this time.  Reservations can be made through the National Recreation Reservation Service by calling 1-877-444-6777 or online at http:\/\/www.recreation.gov\/ Reservations for these two NPS campgrounds can be made up to 6 months in advance.   There is only one RV campground within the park with full hook-ups. It is located in Grand Canyon Village on the South Rim. Trailer Village is a concessioner operated RV park with full hook-ups.  For Trailer Village reservations, visit Delaware North's website.   The NPS Desert View Campground, on the South Rim of the park, and 25 miles (41 km) to the east of Grand Canyon Village, is first-come, first-served only. No reservations are accepted. Desert View Campground fills each day by 1-2 pm. The campground season ends mid-October 2016. There are no RV hook-ups at Desert View.        How Do I Decide Which Rim to Visit ?         Sunset from Mather Point   Most people visit Grand Canyon National Park's South Rim  The South Rim of the Grand Canyon is open all year and is located on the \"Arizona\" side of the Canyon. The South Rim is closer to Interstate 40 and to the transportation centers of Williams, Flagstaff and Phoenix, Arizona. The South Rim also has a local airport and rail service.  Since it is easier to get to, the South Rim is very busy, and during the summer season, campgrounds hustle and bustle and are often filled to capacity. Reservations are strongly recommended.  Detailed information about camping on the South Rim (including Desert View)            View from Grand Canyon Lodge.   North Rim: Harder to Get to - More Wild and Secluded   Because of its 8,000 ft\/ 2,438m elevation and liklihood of early snowfall, most visitor services on the North Rim are only available during a short season that lasts from May 15 through October 31 each year.  The North Rim is located on the \"Utah\" side of the Canyon. The nearest towns to the park's North Rim village are Fredonia, Arizona, and Kanab, Utah. There is no airport or rail service to the park. (that means that the North Rim village may only be reached by road) Because the North Rim has a shorter season, Campground Reservations are strongly Recommended.  Detailed information about camping on the North Rim (including Tuweep)           The mile-deep Colorado River creates a barrier that splits the park into north and south Rims. In this illustration, the North Rim is shown in yellow and the South Rim is shown in blue.   Why is the park separated into South and North Rims? A 277 mile long (446 km) canyon separates the park into South and North Rims. The Grand Canyon of the Colorado River is a mile-deep, (1.6 km) and creates a barrier that bisects the park. Even though the average distance across the canyon is only 10 miles\/ 16 km, be aware that it is a five-hour drive of 215 miles\/ 346 km between the park's South Rim Village and the North Rim Village.  Scenery, climate and vegetation are noticably different between north and south rims because of differences in elevation. It is almost like having two parks in one and it takes time, planning and effort to be able to visit both sides of the Canyon in one trip.         Quick links to information about:     Lodging  Maps    Campgrounds  Food    Visitor Centers  Permits   Sunrise\/ Sunset  Things To Do   Ranger Programs Shuttle Buses   Guided Tours     Park Newspapers River Trips   Backcountry Hiking Mule Trips",
