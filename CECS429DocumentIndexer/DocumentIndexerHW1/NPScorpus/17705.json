Soldiers from the Presidio of San Francisco spent the summer months in Yosemite and Sequoia. Their tasks included blazing trails, constructing roads, creating maps, evicting grazing livestock, extinguishing fires, monitoring tourists, and keeping poachers and loggers at bay. Among the units that patrolled the parks were Buffalo Soldiers of the 24th Infantry and 9th Cavalry. These African American troopers were in the Sierra parks in 1899, 1903, and 1904. They played a crucial role in events and achievements that shaped the parks as well as the entire national park system. The stories of the Buffalo Soldiers span three different national parks.
