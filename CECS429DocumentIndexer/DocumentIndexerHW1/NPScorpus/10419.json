Museums, such as the Science Museum of Minnesota and the Mill City Museum, are up to modern accessibility standards. Trails that run through parks are sometimes of mixed surfaces, although many are paved.     NPS Properties NPS property and rented facilities within this large park are accessible, with the exception of our river islands. This includes a short trail at Coldwater Spring, which is packed hard-surfaced gravel with gentle grades acceptable for wheelchair use. Other trails at this location are informal dirt paths, sometimes with steep slopes, which are rough and muddy after rains. The Mississippi River Visitor Center is accessible from the Science Museuem of Minnesota's parking ramp via elevators.",
