More than 450 vertebrate species occur in the park. The relatively intact wildlife populations of the mountains are especially impressive considering their proximity to one of the largest urban areas in the United States. The continued maintenance of wildlife populations in the Santa Monica Mountains is dependent on the ability of public and private land managers to ensure adequate habitat for the most sensitive species.",
