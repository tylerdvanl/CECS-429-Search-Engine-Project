The park also has hiking trails, a horse trail, and welcomes on-road bicyclists.  Within walking distance of the Visitor Center is the Soldiers' National Cemetery where Union dead from the Battle of Gettysburg were buried and today is the resting place for veterans and their families from all wars. It is also the place where President Abraham Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address on November 19, 1863. Park visitors usually make the cemetery a must-see stopping point during their visit. The cemetery is open from dawn to sundown, with parking located in Ziegler's Grove at the intersection of Hancock Avenue and Taneytown Road. The cemetery is closed to vehicular traffic with the exception of mobility impaired visitors who must obtain a permit from the National Park Service at the Museum and Visitor Center before entering the cemetery.          The David Wills House (Main Street Gettysburg)  THE DAVID WILLS HOUSE Attorney David Wills' home in Gettysburg was not just in the center of Gettysburg, it was the center of the immense clean-up process after the Battle of Gettysburg and where President Abraham Lincoln put the finishing touches on his Gettysburg Address. The speech transformed Gettysburg's community from a place of devastation to the symbol of our nation's new birth of freedom. The Wills House museum features six galleries, two of which include rooms that have been restored to their 1863 appearance: Will's office where he received letters from families looking for loved ones after the battle and undertook plans for a national cemetery and its dedication; and the bedroom where Lincoln stayed the night before he delivered the Gettysburg Address. The Wills House is operated by the Gettysburg Foundation, the official support organization with Gettysburg National Military Park, and is listed on the Register of National Historic Places. 2016 Operating Hours Winter Hours  December: 10 am - 4 pm, Saturday & Sunday January 1 - February 12: CLOSED February 13-15, 20-21, 27-28: 10 am - 4 pm  Spring Hours  March & April: 10 am - 4 pm, Wednesday through Monday (closed Tuesdays)  Summer Hours  May through August: 10 am - 5 pm, Daily  Fall Hours  September & October: 10 am - 4 pm, Wednesday through Monday (closed Tuesdays) November: 10 am - 4 pm, Saturday & Sunday (Open Veteran's Day: November 11, and November 18: 6 pm - 8 pm)  There is a fee to enter the Wills House.
