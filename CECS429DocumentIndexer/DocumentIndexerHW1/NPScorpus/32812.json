The North Cascades are the last refuge for the grizzly bear along the West Coast between Canada and Mexico.  Duration:7 minutes, 51 seconds              Park Videos                       Pathways for Youth: Developing Stewards at North Cascades Pathways for Youth is an effort to create the next generation of public lands stewards and National Park Service employees. By deliberately connecting existing programs and partnerships, North Cascades is creating a continuum of meaningful park-based experiences. Follow Grace and other youth as they discuss their own unique pathways through educational programs, internships and seasonal employment.  Duration:6 minutes, 13 seconds                                Hozmeen Chert Hozomeen chert is a locally abundant and distinctive tool stone found exclusively in the northern Cascade range of Washington and British Columbia. Over the last two decades, archeologist Bob Mierendorf has studied quarries near today's Ross Lake reservoir that reveal a 10,000 year long record of indigenous involvement with this rugged, high-mountain landscape.The word Hozomeen means \"sharp, like a sharp knife.\" Its story cuts across time and place, cultures and borders, archeology and oral histories, connecting us all as human beings. As Bob says, we're all descended from people who used stone to make their tools. \"It's what put food on the table for thousands of years.\"  Duration:7 minutes, 11 seconds                  Cascading Effects  (14:13) Jim Tharp      Examining the sublime landscapes of North Cascade, Mount Rainier, and Olympic National Parks, researchers shed light on emerging indications that climate change is real and predict how warming temperatures will affect the natural resources and timeless beauty of the region. As glaciers melt and the winter snow-pack decreases, what is the fate of the aquatic ecosystems and cold water fish that depend on runoff during the hottest and driest parts of the year? How will enormous amounts of unstable sediment exposed by retreating ice-sheets on Mount Rainier affect the roads and infrastructure of that park and beyond? Will pine beetle infestations and larger forest fires become widespread in the approaching future? -Terra     Partner Videos (external links)          Parks Climate Challenge (13:08) Benjamin Drummond and Sara Joy Steele North Cascades Institute      This summer, 19 high school students from Chicago, DC, Denver, San Francisco and Seattle spent a month in the North Cascades. For many, it was their first time camping. They hiked to glaciers, swam with bull trout, dodged thunderstorms, taught fifth graders about CO2, and went canoeing for days. It was an opportunity to both connect with a national park and witness impacts of climate change. The group was provided with an audio recorder and two cameras to document this experience and tell their story. -NCI         Mountain School  (6:52) Omar Garcia and Michelle Tamez North Cascades Institute      Mountain School is a nationally recognized environmental education program offered by North Cascades Institute in cooperation with North Cascades National Park. Mountain School students come to the North Cascades with their school class, teacher and chaperones to learn about the ecosystems, geology and natural and cultural history of the mountains. Mountain School gives young people an experience they will remember forever – a chance to increase their knowledge of the world with their bodies, minds and spirits. -NCI         Family Getaways (4:45) Benjamin Drummond and Sara Joy Steele North Cascades Institute      From canoeing and hiking adventures, to bat-watching, bunkbeds and campfires, North Cascades Institute’s Family Getaways provide a unique three-day opportunity for families of all shapes and sizes to gather in the North Cascades. -NCI",
