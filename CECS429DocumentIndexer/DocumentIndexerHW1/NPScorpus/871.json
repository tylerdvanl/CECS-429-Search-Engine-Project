NPS        Adaptive management is the process of using information as it becomes available to adjust management actions. Rocky Mountain National Park staff consistently monitor management actions and resource conditions to determine the progress of elk and vegetation management objectives and make changes as needed.        Willows need active management to recover after the Fern Lake Fire of 2012. NPS  This process can continually improve management techniques through flexibility and adaptation. RMNP elk and vegetation management uses the following seven-step approach:  Collect baseline data on existing conditions Establish desired future conditions for the elk population Establish desired future conditions for aspen, riparian montane willow and upland herbaceous vegetation communities Apply management actions Monitor the effectiveness of management actions Perform general surveillance for other potential resource effects Reconsider management actions if monitoring and research show unsuccessful results          Connect to more information about elk and vegetation management below.
