Prehistoric people used places like Sampson's Island as a place to set up camp while within the floodplain to hunt and gather food. As the land was settled in the 18th century, transportation routes crossed the floodplain, requiring the services offered at places such as Bates Ferry to help get goods and materials across the river before bridges were built in the 20th century. Landowners using the land to raise livestock built large mounds that offered protection to their cattle and other animals from the regular flooding that covered the landscape. These places offer us a glimpse into how this land was utilized before becoming a national park.",
