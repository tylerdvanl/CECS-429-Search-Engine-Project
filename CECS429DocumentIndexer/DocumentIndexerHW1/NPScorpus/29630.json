    "body": "Plan Your Visit       As part of a living, breathing, changing landscape, the Niagara Falls National Heritage Area is not subject to the same restrictions as traditional National Park sites. Rather, it reflects the still evolving history and culture of the people who call the region home. So be patient! Be observant! And, be prepared to meet residents who are proud of the special place in which they live.",
