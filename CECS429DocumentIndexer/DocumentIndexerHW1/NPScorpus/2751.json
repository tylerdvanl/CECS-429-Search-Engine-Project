Join our team! Volunteers-In-Parks (VIPs) are Very Important People! Your contribution of time and energy will help us to protect the magnificent natural and cultural areas entrusted to us, and you’ll go home with a sense of pride at having participated in something worthwhile. Lake Mead National Recreation Area is your national park!   Every year, thousands of individuals contribute their enthusiasm and skills to help the National Park Service preserve and protect the natural and cultural resources and to serve and educate visitors. Volunteers help in almost every area of the park, from maintaining campgrounds to leading guided hikes. The time commitment for volunteer work varies from one-day projects to continuous work extending over months.   Individuals, families, and organized groups are welcome to volunteer. Opportunities are available both for highly skilled professionals and for beginners with little or no experience in land management. Volunteers can expect physically demanding working conditions due to the park environment. The nature of the work at the park can be challenging - but rewarding!
