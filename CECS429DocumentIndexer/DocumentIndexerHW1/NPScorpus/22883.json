The following are some suggestions for self-guided student activities during your field trip to Dinosaur National Monument. Utah side of Monument, near Jensen:   Quarry Visitor Center: The visitor center features exhibits that introduce the variety of resources found throughout the monument. A 12 minute park film is also available. This is also your starting point for trips to see the fossil wall at the Quarry Exhibit Hall.  Desert Voices hiking trail (1½ mile loop; moderately easy): This trail begins near the boat ramp at the Split Mountain Campground. The trail offers excellent views of Split Mountain and several adjacent rock layers. Geology is the outstanding feature on this trail. Signage on the trail was written and drawn by children for children. There is no shade.  Fossil Discovery hiking trail (½ mile one-way; moderately easy): The Fossil Discovery Trail Guide brochure provides information about the rock layers along the trail. The trail cuts through tilted rock layers, exposing a great variety of rocks and fossils. The Morrison Formation stop features an outcropping of several small pieces and a few large pieces of dinosaur bones.  Tour of the Tilted Rocks auto tour (11 miles one-way, accessible by bus): Along this route, students can discover pictographs (painted designs) and petroglyphs (scratched or carved designs) from the Fremont Culture,  tilted rock layers, and an historic homesite. Numbered posts along the route correspond to information printed in the Tour of the Tilted Rocks guide (available for $1.00 at the visitor center or in an honor box just after the entrance station). Two other brochures, Josie Bassett Morris and Petroglyphs and Pictographs provide more in-depth information about the sites along the route. At the end of the route, two hiking trails lead into box canyons that Josie used to corral her livestock. The trail into the box canyon named Box Canyon begins at the restroom. This trail is a shaded, easy ½ mile, one way, route that reveals nice exposures of the craggy sandstone of Split Mountain. The trail into the box canyon named Hog Canyon begins by the pond. This ¾ mile trail, one-way, is also easy and shaded for most of the route. A spring-fed creek runs through the canyon and numerous wildflowers bloom during the spring season.
