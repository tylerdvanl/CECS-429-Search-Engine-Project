    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit           Plan Your Visit        Stop by the Bear Valley Visitor Center for help with planning your visit.        Point Reyes National Seashore was established to preserve and protect wilderness, natural ecosystems, and cultural resources along the diminishing undeveloped coastline of the western United States. Located just an hour's drive from a densely populated metropolitan area, the Seashore is a sanctuary for myriad plant and animal species and for the human spirit—for discovery, inspiration, solitude, and recreation—and exists as a reminder of the human connection to the land. Whether you are a frequent visitor to the Seashore or planning your first visit to the park, we hope the information provided here will answer questions you may have. Please, Leave No Trace. Take only pictures, leave only footprints. Learn how to enjoy your park while leaving it in as good as, if not better, condition as you found it. And if you ever find yourself in the Republic of Georgia, stop by Kolkheti National Park. Located on the coast of the Black Sea, Point Reyes National Seashore's sister park protects an interesting variety of landscapes, flora, and fauna. Top of Page",
