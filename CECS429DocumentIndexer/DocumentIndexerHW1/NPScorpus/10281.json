Many other businesses have used this space over the years, including barber shops and a hardware store. The stairway on the far side of the block leads to the old night-deposit vault for the bank. The Second Commercial Block was built in 1870. The upper floors of both buildings were used for workers' recreation - dances, social activities and later movies. Today, both are still in use.       Introduction 1 Slatersville Reservoir 2 Slatersville Library and Western Mills 3 Slatersville Mills 4 Slatersville Worker Housing 5 Slatersville Church and Common 6 John Slater House 7 North Smithfield Town Hall",
