In all seasons, whether walking or day hiking, follow these tips to conserve your internal water reserves: Reduce Your Activity During the warmest days, generally from mid-April through mid-October, avoid hiking during the heat of the day - generally from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm. Find Shade Shade in the desert means the difference between excessive heat gain from the sun and sheer comfort. In an emergency, a person resting in the shade will survive longer than someone exposed to the sun. Drink Your Water Don't try to conserve the drinking water you have. Carry plenty of drinking water - then drink it - at least 1 gallon per person per day. Reduce Alcohol & Caffeine Intake Water is the best remedy for dehydration and listlessness. The diuretic effects of caffeine and alcohol can result in accelerated loss of body water. Protect Your Body Skin is sensitive and burns easily; make use of shade, sunscreen, sunglasses, and a wide-brimmed hat. Proper footwear protects feet and provides support for ankles.
