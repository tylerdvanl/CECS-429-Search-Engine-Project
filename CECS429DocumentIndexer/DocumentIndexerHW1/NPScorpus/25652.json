NPS Photo \/ Phil Westcott  Wales is one the oldest villages on the Seward Peninsula and has a population of about 160 people. Like other villages on the peninsula, most residents lead subsistence lifestyles of hunting, gathering, trapping, and reindeer herding. Very few homes have plumbing or running water. If you visit Wales, be prepared with your own supplies. The village can be accessed by taking a charter or commercial flight from Nome. A walk along the beach will take you to the boundary of the national preserve.",
