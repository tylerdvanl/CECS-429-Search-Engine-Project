The Mississippi National River and Recreation Area offers many opportunities to get involved in serving and protecting the Mississippi River. Volunteer Opportunities  The Mississippi National River and Recreation Area's Volunteers in Parks (VIP) program is a dynamic and growing program offering volunteers the opportunity to get involved in a variety of efforts on a regular or occasional basis. The program has grown from just 63 volunteers in 1998 to a robust program with over 6,000 volunteers today. Park volunteers and the park program have been recognized regionally and nationally. The VIP program is managed in cooperation with the park's friends group, the Mississippi River Fund. Join the team, work alongside National Park Rangers and help educate about and protect the Mississippi River.

Donations help sustain the park by developing and enhancing programs such as Urban Wilderness Canoe Adventures, Big River Journey and numerous habitat restoration events.",
