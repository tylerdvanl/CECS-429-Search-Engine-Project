    "body": "Currents of Change  On an island amid towering spruce and hemlock, Sitka National Historical Park preserves the site of a battle between invading Russian traders and indigenous Kiks.ádi Tlingit. Park visitors are awed by Tlingit and Haida totem poles standing along the park’s scenic coastal trail, and the restored Russian Bishop’s House speaks of Russia’s little known colonial legacy in North America.                The E.W. Merrill Collection at Sitka NHP   The park museum collection includes 1167 glass plate negatives by photographer E.W. Merrill, offering a glimpse of early 20th century Sitka.        Ranger Guided Walks Through History   Daily ranger-guided tours begin in early May.  Check the calendar for up-to-date offerings.",
