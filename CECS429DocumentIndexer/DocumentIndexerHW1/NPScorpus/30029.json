The restriction on alcohol in these structures may be waived during special events with written permission via a special use permit. The National Park Service does not prohibit the use or possession of alcoholic beverages in public areas within Fire Island National Seashore. However, where the Seashore boundaries overlap with town boundaries, town ordinances may be enforced by other agencies. The Town of Islip, Town of Brookhaven, and the Villages of Ocean Beach and Saltaire prohibit the possession of open containers or the consumption of alcoholic beverages in places open to the general public, except where licensed or specially permitted. Fire Island Concessions, LLC is permitted to sell alcoholic beverages at its Watch Hill bar and restaurant; a limited selection of beer is available at its camp store and snack bars. Marina quiet hours must be respected between 10:00 pm and 6:00 am. Disorderly conduct is not tolerated, and can result in a fine and\/or arrest.       Operating a boat or motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs is prohibited. Vehicles and vessels may not be operated with an open container of alcohol within access of the operator. Be aware that alcohol can be even more hazardous on the water than on land. The possession or use of glass containers is prohibited in the water and in adjacent beach areas at the Watch Hill and Sailors Haven designated lifeguarded beaches. The possession, use, sale or distribution of any controlled substance is prohibited.",
