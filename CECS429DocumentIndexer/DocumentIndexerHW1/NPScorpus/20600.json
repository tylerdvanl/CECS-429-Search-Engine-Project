    "body": "Management       Join the Adventure The Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail was authorized by Congress in 2006 so that visitors to the Chesapeake Bay can understand the significance of John Smith's explorations and his impact upon the rich American Indian cultures of the time. Moreover, visitors can come to appreciate and care for the life and landscape of this national treasure, America's largest estuary. Although there are many ways to travel and enjoy Smith's historic routes today, the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail is still in development. You can help forge America's first national water trail. A work in progress, the trail comes as a result of the diligent efforts of many public and private partners.
