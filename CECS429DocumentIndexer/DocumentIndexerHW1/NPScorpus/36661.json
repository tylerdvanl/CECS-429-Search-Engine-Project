The flowers are small, consisting of 6 white to creamy petal-like segments arranged in a star shape. The flowers are also noted for having two very small green dots at each \"petal's\" base. Very long and narrow grayish to green leaves grow almost entirely from the lower part of the plant and may have purple edges at the base. The main stems vary in color from grayish purple to grayish green. Plant Lore: Hungry early settlers sometimes mistakenly thought the bulbs of this species were those of wild onions or Sego Lilies and would then eat them with deadly results. This plant is also deadly to cattle and especially sheep.         When and where to see at Bryce: This lethal plant can be seen in the spring along the Mossy Cave Trail just past the waterfall. Look up on the banks of Tropic Ditch. Further Reading: Buchanan, Hayle 1992. Wildflowers of Southwestern Utah. Bryce Canyon Natural History Association. Bryce Canyon, Utah.
