    "body": "On-Site Visit              Real-World Learning For 3rd Graders   Intro_׀_Pre-Visit_׀_On-Site_׀_Post-Visit_׀_ Get Involved   At Fairsted, students investigate the Restored Landscape to learn about artistic and scientific dimensions of landscape design, including plant selection and placement, topography, and design intent. By \"reading\" the landscape, drawing plant specimens, and comparing different zones in the landscape, students discover how the selection and arrangement of landscape elements contribute to the look, feel and function of \"place.\"   Students then tour the Historic Design Office to find out how various tools were used to solve an authentic c. 1890 park design problem. They learn the steps involved in the design process, and discover the knowledge and skills required by the profession.   In the Olmsted Model Shop students work in teams to design a park landscape. They listen to clients, deliberate ideas, build a 3D model to communicate their design ideas, and then describe how their designs satisfy client needs and help strengthen the surrounding community.   I loved exploring the landscape - especially the Rock Garden, but my favorite part was designing parks for our clients. I wish the clients could see all of our model designs.  Thank you very much for inviting us to Fairsted!\"   View a slide show of On-Site Activities.",
