Campground, dump station, and Lehman Caves tour fees are mandated by the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (2004) to be used on projects with a direct visitor connection. With the funds, the park has hired fee and interpretive staff, tackled the maintenance backlog, and improved trails and campsites.
