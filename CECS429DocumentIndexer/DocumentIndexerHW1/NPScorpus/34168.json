The luminaria pays tribute to soldiers who have given their lives for this country. To honor those soldiers, members of the Mattaponi and Aquia Districts of the Boy Scouts of America and the Commonwealth Council Girl Scouts of the USA light 15,300 candles in the cemetery –one for each soldier buried there. In addition, a bugler played \"Taps\" every 30 minutes during the evening and park staff posted throughout the cemetery told the stories of soldiers interred there. 2016 marked the 150th anniversary of the establishment of the national cemetery, and themes related to this topic were incorporated into the narration.   Videos of the five stops from the 2016 program are available. View the first stop.",
