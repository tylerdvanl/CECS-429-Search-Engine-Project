The mighty caribou herd and salmon runs provided enough food to see their dogs and them through the long, lean months of winter. They hunted moose, bear, wolf and wolverine from wooden sleds pulled by teams of domesticated dogs and weathered the harsh Arctic winters in parkas made of caribou hide. Food was stored in baskets made from wild grass, and during the dark days of winter, stone lamps full of caribou tallow or seal oil provided the only light. To the Inupiat, the far North was a land of plenty.         Waterfowl such as these Red-breasted Merganser ducks are an important source of food for local people who collect their eggs and hunt the birds for meat.  NPS Photo   Seasonal Use Subsistence defines the seasons as much as the weather in Northwest Alaska. Salmon season gives way to caribou season, just as sure as summer is followed by fall, and people organize their lives accordingly. Many families leave their homes in the nearby villages and spend their summers at subsistence camps in the preserve, taking advantage of the long hours of sunlight to set nets for salmon and char and pick wild greens and berries on the tundra. Visitors to Noatak National Preserve need to be sensitive to these activities and not interfere with the age-old subsistence harvest taking place in the preserve, especially during the key seasons of summer and fall. A Living History The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), the legislation that established Noatak National Preserve and many other Alaskan national parks, specifically protects subsistence harvest by local residents. Subsistence is vital to the everyday survival of many rural Alaskans. It preserves both the traditional way of life and generations of accumulated knowledge in Northwest Alaska. Noatak National Preserve does more than protect the land Inupiat people have lived on for generations; it also protects their traditional way of life for future generations. In Northwest Alaska, subsistence is more than a tradition – it’s a way of life. Stores are often under stocked, and the food they do sell is expensive. The food provided by the river and tundra not only preserves a cultural tradition that dates back thousands of years, but allows the first people of the Noatak River to continue to thrive there.",
