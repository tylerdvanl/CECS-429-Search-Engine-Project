In addition, the offshore waters along the Pacific coast as well as estuarine areas in San Francisco Bay and Tomales Bay provide rearing habitat for steelhead. Threats to this species include degradation of spawning gravels, habitat degredation, and water diversions. The endangered coho salmon is found in the Lagunitas, Olema, and Redwood Creek watersheds. Juveniles are often found in deep pools with abundant cover in the form of undercut banks, overhanging vegetation, and woody materials. In addition, the offshore waters along the Pacific coast as well as estuarine areas in Tomales Bay could provide rearing habitat for coho salmon. Threats to this species include degradation of spawning gravels, habitat degredation, and water diversions.  Â    The endangered tidewater goby currently lives in Rodeo Lagoon and parts of Tomales Bay. Historic records indicate that the small estuarine fish occurred in at least 9 other locations within the San Francisco Bay Region, such as Lake Merced and the Cliff House\/Sutro Baths in San Francisco. Threats to this species include loss of habitat through excessive sedimentation, poor water quality, and non-native competitors.",
