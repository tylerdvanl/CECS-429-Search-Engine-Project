In fact, this church was built in late 1829 by the residents of the nearby town of Manzano.  This new church was to be built in the shadow of the Quarai Mission, but public protest soon caused a stop to construction.  Apache raids in 1830 may have influenced the decision to move the church's location. A new location was selected closer to the town of Manzano, where the church still stands.  After the new church location moved closer to town, construction on the Manzano Church near the Quarai Mission was never completed.        Early stabilization photo of the Manzano Church.
