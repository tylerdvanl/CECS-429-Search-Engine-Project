Although the topics vary by Ranger, you will lean about the flora and fauna, the culture, and the history of Bandelier National Monument that you might not hear anywhere else. This short 1 to 1.5 hour tour starts from the Visitor Center and ends at the Tyuonyi Pueblo or beyond. Mid-May through mid-October, daily at 10:30 and 2:00 Backcountry Get Outdoors Hike Join our Backcountry Ranger for a more adventurous hike into the backcountry.   If the idea of going beyond the sight of the Visitor Center or the parking lot has frightened you, but you still want to get to places few get to in Bandelier, joining a Ranger might just be the opportunity you have been searching for.   Hikes by reservation only.  Call the visitor center for an updated list of hike dates and locations.",
