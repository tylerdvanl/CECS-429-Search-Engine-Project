Public access ramps are steep and either graveled or a mixture of sand and gravel atop an anchored Miraweb (black plastic) base. The USFWS constructed an accessible ramp in 2006 just below the Cornell Bridge on the east bank of the river. There is, however, no accessible take-out point downstream at this time.   Please call the USFWS (402) 376-3789 or the NPS (402) 376-1901 for advice\/information regarding floating the river for those people with disabilities.
