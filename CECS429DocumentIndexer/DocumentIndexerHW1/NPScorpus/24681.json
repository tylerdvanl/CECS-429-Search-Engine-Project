Already, she has broken two doors from jumping on them out of excitement for dinner. When Nuna is not busy breaking doors, she is pulling her volunteer dog walkers into ditches. She absolutely loves to pull and you can tell when she is happy because her tail--rather than wagging back and forth—points straight up in the air.        NPS Photo  Kavik (M)  Kavik is the adopted brother of Nuna and Aliqsi. He is a racing dog from a kennel in Kotzebue who came to the kennels in April 2011. Kavik’s name is Inuit for “Wolverine.” He is a squirrelly dog who has grown to love people. Kavik is one of our best summer lead dogs and loves the consistency of guiding a team around the track.",
