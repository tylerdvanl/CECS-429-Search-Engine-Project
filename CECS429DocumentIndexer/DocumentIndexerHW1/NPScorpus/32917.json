Whether you are monitoring spotted owls, leading educational programs or rehabilitating a trail in the backcountry, you will work alongside experienced park staff. Internships are usually between eight and fourteen weeks long and are primarily offered during the summer months. All interns are provided with a small stipend and park housing is sometimes available. NOTE: Olympic opens recruitment for these positions at specific times during the season.
