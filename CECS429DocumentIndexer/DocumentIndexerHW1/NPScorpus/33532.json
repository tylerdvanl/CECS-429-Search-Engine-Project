Junior Rangers help to preserve National Parks; they learn about Lake Roosevelt, have fun, and are our representatives to their friends, families, and schoolmates back home. Junior Rangers spread their new knowledge about Parks and continue to use good environmental practices. How can you become a Junior Ranger?  At Lake Roosevelt, there are multiple ways for you to complete the Junior Ranger requirements and be sworn in as a Lake Roosevelt National Park Junior Ranger. All of our Junior Ranger programs are free of charge. Visit any Lake Roosevelt Ranger Station or District Office to learn more.",
