NPS   Â    Dinosaur National Monument is a land of rivers and desert, of mountains and canyons. Coyotes and mountain lions wander the monument's rugged landscape, past dinosaur graveyards, thriving prairie dog towns, and the cool green of a cottonwood-shaded streambank. Peregrine falcons make their homes in towering canyon cliffs and greater sage grouse nest under the silver-leafed sagebrush. Below the rugged canyon walls, Dinosaur's rivers provide some of the last known spawning and nursery habitat for several endangered fish.
