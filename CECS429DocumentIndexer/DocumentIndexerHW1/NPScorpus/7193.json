Several decades ago, workers dug a trench near that firesite to lay a drainage ditch. Yesterday, park visitors walked over that trench to visit the park. In between those years many people have lived part of thier lives on the ground that is today Hampton National Historic Site. Owners, enslaved, British Prisoners of War, indentured servants, free workers, tradesmen, craftsmen. Some came to work, others to recreate, others to live. A visit to Hampton will offer a glimpse into their lives, how they intertwined, and how they were affected by changes in history.  Â                 People of Hampton   2 Photos",
