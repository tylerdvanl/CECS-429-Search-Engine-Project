Special Park Use Permits Lowell National Historical Park is a unique national park which is often host to numerous events and activities. Most special events and activities held in the park require a special use permit, issued only after the National Park Service (NPS) determines that the activities involved will not impair park values and resources. Please note that there are usage limits for the number of people and vehicles for any special activity. For more information on permits and applications, you can contact the park at (978) 275-1783, email, or by mail: Special Use Permit Coordinator 67 Kirk Street, Lowell, MA 01852              Special Events A special use permit is required for activities that provide a benefit to an individual, group, or organization rather than the public at large and that require some degree of management from the National Park Service to protect park resources and the public interest.

First Amendment Activities Freedom of speech, press, religion, and assembly are constitutional rights. However, the courts have recognized that activities associated with the exercise of these rights may be reasonably regulated to protect park resources. Therefore, all first amendment activities require special use permits and the NPS may regulate the time, place, and manner in which they are conducted. Some examples of special events that require permits are:  distribution and\/or sale of printed matter religious services public demonstrations or assemblies, etc. collecting signature for petitions  Download First Amendment Permit Application (PDF) Miscellaneous Activities Other activities may require permits if there is the potential for interference with visitor use, congestion of a highly visited area, or possible impact on park resources.
