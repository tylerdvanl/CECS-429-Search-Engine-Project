Freshwater from local streams empties into the lagoon from the land. Saltwater from the Bering Sea enters the lagoon through gaps in the islands. The two mix, creating an estuary that serves as a nursery for many species. Fish using Ikpek Lagoon include salmon, Dolly Varden, and herring. Marine mammals like seals and polar bears also use the lagoon. High numbers of shorebirds and seabirds are also found in this ideal home.         Cape Espenberg Exposed to the Chukchi Sea and underlain by frozen soil know as permafrost, the Cape Espenberg area merges the tundra with the coast. Tundra polygons and thaw lakes give way to coastal sand dunes and mud flats. Ecosystems include wet meadows, tussock and dwarf shrub tundra, willow thickets, and salt marshes. Plants from many of these ecosystems are found together on the cape's drier north coast, which helps stabilize its shifting sands. The tundra and the coast truely bled together on Cape Espenberg.         Cowpack Inlet 31 miles (50 km) north of the village of Shishmaref is Cowpacket inlet, the mouth of the Cowpack River. Fresh water from the river mixes with saltwater from the ocean in the inlet, creating an estuary. Ecosystems also mix, with low-lying tundra, gravel beaches, and brackish meadows all found in the area. This mixture of life includes animals as well. A variety of fish, sea mammals, and land mammals use the inlet. Many waterfowl, seabirds, and shorebirds also call Cowpack Inlet home.",
