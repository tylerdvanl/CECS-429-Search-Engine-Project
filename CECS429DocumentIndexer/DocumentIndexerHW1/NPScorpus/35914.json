NPS Photo - Cookie Ballou   Â    Many people restrict the term wildlife for animals that have fur or feathers. By doing so, they overlook some of the animals best adapted to the desert and most likely to be seen. When the mind conjures images of the desert, lizards basking on rocks, or rattlesnakes coiled at the base of shrubs are often part of that picture. These archetypal images are only part of the story. As you explore the park and discover how different it is from desert expanses that surround it, you will find reptiles displaying fascinating behaviors and a beautiful array of patterns and forms worthy of the attention of any wildlife lover.",
