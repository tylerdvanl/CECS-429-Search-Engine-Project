    "body": "Nonnative Species       One need not look far to find a non-native plant species within the park. These plants were used as ornamentals or for erosion prevention and bank stabilization. Now they are invading the historic, former lakebed and surrounding fields and woodlands, and in some cases have reached problematic stages.  Efforts are currently underway to maintain control of the most threatening exotic species in areas of the park where the infestations can be managed. The park presently has an integrated pest management program for giant and Japanese knotweeds, exotic bush honeysuckles and multiflora rose.",
