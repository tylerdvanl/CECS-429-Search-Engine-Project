NPS       The winter of 1996–1997 was one of the harshest winters of the 1990s, with abundant snow, cold temperatures, and a thick ice layer in the snowpack. Unable to access the forage under the ice, more than 1,000 bison left the park and were shot or shipped to slaughter amid concerns they could transmit brucellosis to cattle in Montana. (See chapter 8) Concerned that groomed roads increased the number of bison leaving the park and being killed, the Fund for Animals and other groups filed suit in the US District Court for the District of Columbia against the NPS in May 1997. The groups alleged that the NPS had failed to examine the environmental impacts of winter use. In 1999, Bluewater Network filed a legal petition with the NPS to ban snowmobiles from all national park units nationwide. These two actions inaugurated more than 15 years of winter use planning and associated lawsuits, and catapulted the issue into one of the NPS’s most visible and enduring environmental controversies. As part of a court mediated settlement, the NPS produced a draft EIS (in 1999) that proposed plowing the road from West Yellowstone to Old Faithful. Public comment did not favor plowing, and unmanaged snowmobile use was deemed to impair park resources. Therefore, park managers opted to ban snowmobiles and allow only snowcoaches in the final EIS published in fall of 2000. At the time, snowmobiles which used new technology to dramatically reduce emissions and somewhat reduce noise (what we now refer to as “Best Available Technology” or BAT) were not widely available commercially. Since that initial EIS, other environmental compliance documents have proposed addressing winter-use impacts using a combination of new technologies, limits on vehicle numbers, mandatory guiding, and monitoring winter-use impacts on park resources. All of these environmental compliance planning documents have proposed allowing a combination of snowmobiles and snowcoaches, with the snowmobile numbers decreasing from plan to plan and snowcoach numbers remaining relatively consistent. By 2002, BAT snowmobiles were commercially available. Requiring visitors to tour with snowmobile guides or in commercially guided snowcoaches reduced the conflicts with wildlife. Resource monitoring allowed the NPS to gauge the effects of these actions and take further protective actions. These changes aimed to eliminate the problems of the past. Each of the subsequent winter use plans was litigated. The Fund for Animals, the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, and other environmental groups consistently sue in the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The International Snowmobile Manufacturer’s Association, the State of Wyoming, the BlueRibbon Coalition, and others consistently file their lawsuits in the US District Court for the District of Wyoming. Litigants have found some traction in each of their courts, with varying degrees of success on any given environmental document. Certainly, the litigation is one of the factors accounting for the ongoing nature of the winter use debate. In each decision against it, the National Park Service has responded by addressing the concerns of the courts. Beginning in 2009, winter use was managed with an interim plan. In 2011, the NPS released a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for public review on the potential effects of the plan for motorized oversnow travel in the park. Nearly 60,000 comments were filed during a more than 60-day public comment period that followed the draft document’s release. After months of public comment and review, the NPS decided additional study was needed before putting a long-term plan in place and the planning process was extended for another year. Among the subjects identified for further study were requirements for entry into the park by 10:30 am daily, sound and air quality computer modeling assumptions, “best available technology” standards for snowcoaches, the impacts of Sylvan Pass avalanche hazard mitigation, and opportunities for park access by non-commercially guided snowmobile groups. Continue: Management by \"Transportation Events\"      Planning and Litigation History  1932: First request to park managers to plow roads year-round. 1949: First visitors using motorized oversnow vehicles (snowplanes).  1955: Snowcoaches enter the park.  1963: First snowmobiles (six, total) enter the park.  1967: Congressional hearing on plowing park roads year-round.  1968: Yellowstone managers formalize oversnow use instead of plowing.  1971: Managers begin grooming roads; Yellowstone Park Co. opens Old Faithful Snow Lodge.  1990: NPS issues first winter-use environmental assessment (EA) for Yellowstone and Grand Teton.  1992: Winter visitation exceeds threshold of 140,000 people per year, 8 years earlier than expected.  1993: NPS begins to evaluate winter recreation in the greater Yellowstone area.  1997: NPS develops a new winter use plan and environmental impact statement (EIS) in response to a lawsuit alleging bison use groomed roads to leave the park, leading to their slaughter.  1999: Draft EIS released; 46,000 public comments received. Organizations petition to prohibit trail grooming and snowmobile use in all national parks.  2000: Final EIS released and Record of Decision signed, banning snowmobiles and converting to snowcoach-only transportation. Snowmobile enthusiasts sue to challenge the ban.  2001: NPS settles with snowmobilers' group, agrees to prepare a supplemental EIS (SEIS).  2002: Draft SEIS released; 357,000 comments received.  2003: Dec. 11: Final rule published in Federal Register to allow 950 Best Available Technology (BAT), guided snowmobiles daily.  —Dec. 16: Federal judge directs park to begin phasing out snowmobiles.  2004: February: Another federal judge stops phase-out; requires temporary rules for rest of winter  —August: NPS releases a new EA, allowing 720 BAT, guided snowmobiles daily; 95,000 comments received.  —Nov: Plan approved. Winter use proceeds per 2004 EA.  2007: March: Draft Final EIS released, it allows 540 BAT, guided snowmobiles in the park daily; 122,000 comments received.  —December: final rule published in Federal Register.  2008: September–December: Federal court decisions cancel the new winter plan.  —December 15: Winter season opens with a modified version of the winter plan followed in 2004–2007, allowing 720 BAT, guided snowmobiles daily.  2009: Winter season opens under interim plan during EIS process, allows 318 BAT, guided snowmobiles and 78 snowcoaches daily for the next two winters.  2010: The National Park Service begins preparing a next long-term plan.  2013: February: Final Winter Use Plan\/SEIS released, proposing to manage oversnow vehicles based on \"transportation events\" rather than the number of snowmobiles and snowcoaches allowed in the park each day.  2013: October: final Rule for winter use released authorizing OSV use based on Transportation Events.        Visitor Survey Results The University of Montana conducted a survey of winter visitors in 2007–2008:   Almost 90% of those surveyed agreed that Yellowstone is a place for natural quiet and to hear natural sounds. 83% were somewhat or very satisfied with their experience of natural sounds. 71% indicated that they found the level of natural sound they desired for half or more of the time they desired it. 87% were “very satisfied” with their overall experience. The remaining 13% were “satisfied.” 71% considered the opportunity to view bison to be extremely important. 87% reported that the wildlife viewing aspect of their Yellowstone winter experience was very satisfying. 99% who saw bison in winter were able to see them behaving naturally. 21% witnessed an encounter where the bison were hurried, took flight, or acted defensively. More than 72% largely considered the bison-human interactions they witnessed and the park setting as a whole as “very” appropriate and\/or acceptable.         More Information  Current Winter Use Updates Winter Ecology in Yellowstone History of the Debate Frequently Asked Questions",
