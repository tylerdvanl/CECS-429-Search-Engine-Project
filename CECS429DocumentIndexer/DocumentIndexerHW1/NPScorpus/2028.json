    "body": "Windows and Door Casings       The original door and window casings of the Tumacácori Mission church were built of wood. As those casings deteriorate from dry rot, termites, and other aging processes, it is necessary to duplicate the originals and replace them, filling in with new lime plaster and sometime portions of the adobe blocks that have fallen away.       Photo by Jana Tschopp        Photo by Jana Tschopp        Photo by Jana Tschopp        Photo by Jana Tschopp",
