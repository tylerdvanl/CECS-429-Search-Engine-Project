NPS\/Neal Herbert           Daily high temperatures in the park can reach or exceed 95°F (35°C) and remain hot through sundown. Many trails have little to no shade. Avoid hiking during the hottest hours of the day (10 am - 6 pm), and carry and drink water throughout your visit.            Each year, park rangers respond to dozens of search or rescue incidents in the park. These frequently involve heat exhaustion, dehydration, climbing or scrambling and improper footwear. We want your visit to be safe and enjoyable. Below are some of the potential hazards you may experience during your visit. Please become familiar with them, and keep them in mind while you're here. Heat & Sun During the summer, expect high temperatures, intense sunlight and low humidity. Eat plenty of food and drink at least one gallon of water each day. Carry and drink water during all activities, such as hiking. Wear loose-fitting, light-colored clothing and a wide-brimmed hat. Apply sunscreen to all exposed skin. Consider saving strenuous activity for early mornings or evenings. Water is available at the visitor center and at Devils Garden Trailhead and Campground. Proper Footwear Wear sturdy shoes with enough tread to give you good traction. Do not hike in smooth-soled shoes or boots. Some trails cover uneven terrain and follow rock ledges Climbing & Scrambling Slickrock invites adventure. When you climb or scramble, be sure you can retrace your steps, and remember that it is often harder to climb back down. Sandstone is very slippery when wet or covered in sand. It is prohibited to climb on or walk across any arch larger than three feet. Lightning & Flash Floods Storms and flash floods can be powerful and sudden. When lightning is present, avoid lone trees, cliff edges and high ridges. Crouch low to the ground. Return to your vehicle if possible. Never try to cross a wash that is flooding. Staying Found Stay with companions while hiking; separation can mean getting lost. Do not count on a cellular phone to summon help; cellular service will not reach into many areas of Arches. If you become lost, stay where you are and wait for rescue. Wandering will endanger your life and make finding you difficult. When traveling alone, always tell someone where you are going and when you expect to return. Animal-Transmitted Diseases Hantavirus, plague, tularemia, and West Nile virus are wildlife-related diseases that have been confirmed in the state of Utah, though not necessarily in the park. Casual visitors to the park are unlikely to be exposed, but awareness is your best defense. Bears Black bears occasionally wander into the park from the nearby mountains.",
