    "body": "Explore President's Park       President's Park, which includes the park lands surrounding the White House, is composed of approximately 82 acres and is home for many significant statues, memorials and structures which give context to our lives today.  Â    Trails Information President's Park has two trails - one north and one south of the White House. On either trail you have the opportunity to learn about some of the individuals and events which have shaped our nation's history. Both trails start at the White House Visitor Center, located at 1450 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW. The northern trail takes you to Sherman Park, where the famous general once reviewed the troops returning from the Civil War, then north to Pennsylvania Avenue and Lafayette Park and ends at the majestic First Division Monument. The southern trail leaves the visitor center and winds its way around the magnificent open parade ground known as the Ellipse, past monuments, memorials, and fountains, ending at the fence surrounding the White House South Lawn. On both trails you will have views of the White House, the home and office of the President of the United States. Just as the White House is the home of our nation's president and first family, President's Park is our nation's front yard!",
