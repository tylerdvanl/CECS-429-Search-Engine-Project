I am a living witness that any one of your children may look to come here as my father's child has.\" -Abraham Lincoln, speech to 166th Ohio Regiment, August 22, 1864   Few places in America have histories as amazing and well-documented as the White House. On the White House's grounds and throughout President's Park's 82 acres are countless opportunities to reflect on the history and of the United States.  Monuments, Memorials and Statues can be found in public areas Lafayette Park and the Ellipse. These points of interest include military memorials, tributes to foreign heroes who helped America win its independence, and even friends of the White House who died on the Titanic. The History of the National Christmas Tree goes back generations, from simple occasions to a nationally-televised spectacle.
