    "body": "Donations       Making a Donation - you can make a gift to benefit the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park directly to the National Park Service. Your gifts will be use only for the benefit of our park and you may identify the program and\/or project for which your gift is intended. No administrative cost is deducted therefore 100% of your gift will be used for the purpose you identify. Your check will be deposited in a government account and the full amount will be spent as you intended. Most parks have separate donations accounts for park-specific projects and programs for which you may earmark your gift.  Visitors to the park can give direct cash or check gifts through our donation boxes. Unlike entrance fees, 100% of donated funds stay in this park. Donation boxes are located at the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace NHP Visitor Center and in the Birthplace Memorial Building. Historic objects, manuscripts, books and other related items that have a direct relationship to Abraham Lincoln may be donated to the park's museum collection, where they are preserved for future generations to enjoy and learn. Contact the park to discuss anything you are considering donating to the park's collection. Volunteer your time! The park can use your assistance in all areas of its operation. Depending upon your skills and interests and the needs of the park, we will match you to the best job available. Volunteer opportunities may be discussed with Ranger Reynolds by calling (270) 358-3137  For information on programs and\/or projects you may wish to consider worthy of your support please contact Superintendent William Justice at:  Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park 2995 Lincoln Farm Road Hodgenville, KY 42748  Telephone: (270) 358-3137",
