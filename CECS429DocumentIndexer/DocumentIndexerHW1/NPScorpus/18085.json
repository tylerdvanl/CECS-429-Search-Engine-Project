In this workshop, we will look at slavery, the efforts to fight and resist slavery by enslaved people, and what political role slavery played in Arkansas' eventual secession from the Union. Participants will receive a lesson plan and packets of primary source materials that are Arkansas specific. The materials and activities for this workshop were developed as part of the \"Passages: Abolition and the Underground Railroad\" Seminar at Yale University, July 2009, sponsored by the Gilder Lerhman Institute of American History. Suggested for grades 7-12. Arkansas's Trail of Tears Legacy (Arkansas History) This is a six hour workshop using online, mutli-media resources to explore the impact of the Trail of Tears on Arkansas and the rights of American Indians and African Americans (freedmen) who were relocated as part of the 1830 Indian Removal Act. Indian Removal had a tremendous economic and social impact on Arkansas. This workshop includes Arkansas history and technology integration.   Theatre Arts and Social Justice using the Central High Story Theatre is a powerful teaching tool. It has the ability to transform lives and it is a great way to unearth stories and create dialogue about social issues in a meaningful way. Teachers are invited to participate in a workshop to explore how to effectively interpret and teach social justice issues through the art of theatre. Teachers will read and discuss One Ninth. One Ninth is a powerful exploration of human dignity and racial conflict as seen through the eyes of teenagers. One Ninth, written by Park Ranger Spirit Trickey features the story of the playwright's mother, Minnijean Brown Trickey, one of the students from The Little Rock Nine who integrated Little Rock Central High School in 1957.
