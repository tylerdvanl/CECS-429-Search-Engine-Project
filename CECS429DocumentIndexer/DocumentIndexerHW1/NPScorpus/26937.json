The natural history of landforms and geologic processes overlaps human experiences in the same locations. Ancient Fremont Indians left art on the rock walls at Upper Pictograph Cave, telling indecipherable tales. Miners in the late 1800s left visible marks behind in the way of structures, pulleys, and mining shafts at the Johnson Lake Mine. And Absalom Lehman, an early settler in the Snake Valley, planted an orchard that remains today, built an aqueduct still discernible in places, and opened beautiful Lehman Caves to the rest of the world.",
