    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Places To Go     Kiilae Village              Kiilae Village      Ki'ilae Village offers a glimpse into the past, when Hawai'i was changing rapidly but still supported traditional aspects of daily life.  With the arrival of Europeans in the Hawaiian Islands, many things changed.  New plants and animals were introduced and settlements began moving away from the coastal villages to the more fertile uplands and larger harbor cities.  What remains in Ki'ilae today are abandoned house sites, agricultural features, animal pens, and salt vats that can be seen from more recent times.  The 1871 trail runs for one mile from behind the visitor center to Ki'ilae Village.  If you plan to hike on the 1871 trail to Ki'ilae Village, please stop by the visitor center to pick up an informative trail guide.     The trail is relatively short and flat but it is a moderately strenuous hike through rough lava.  Please wear sturdy shoes, a hat, sunscreen and carry plenty of water.",
