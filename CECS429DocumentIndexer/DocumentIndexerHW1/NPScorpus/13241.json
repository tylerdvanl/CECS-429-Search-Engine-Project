Â       Yosemite Museum The Yosemite Museum opened to the public in 1926, and was built to be a model for museums in national parks.Its current collection is one of the largest and most diverse in the National Park System, as its holdings include all manner of natural and cultural materials related to Yosemite and its environs. Collections are displayed throughout the year in the Indian Cultural Museum and Museum Gallery, which hosts changing exhibits. The collection includes archeological materials collected inside the park, as well as a large collection of ethnographic material from the Yosemite region.The ethnographic collection is particularly important because so many of the maker's or former owner's names are known.The Indian Cultural Exhibit features this portion of the collection.  Additional historic materials are preserved by the park including fine art, artifacts related to early residents and businesses, photographic material, publications, memorabilia and souvenirs.Several early wagons and historic vehicles in the collection are kept in Wawona. Zoological specimens, some collected by the Yosemite Field School and others collected under permit agreements, form part of the museum's holdings, as does a small collection of geological material.The park maintains a large herbarium as well.
