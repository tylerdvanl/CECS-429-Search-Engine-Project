The park recently completed surveys of fish, reptiles, and amphibians and, as of summer 2002, is completing a survey of birds at the park.  The results of recent surveys provide additional information about the continued extent of species diversity at the park. Common mammals at the park include species typically associated with rural and developed areas, including eastern cottontail, gray squirrel, deer mouse, beaver, red fox, coyote, and white-tailed deer.  Less common species, such as bobcat and fisher, also inhabit the area. In addition, at least 70 species of birds, 12 species of fish, and more than 30 species of reptiles and amphibians have been documented at the park.",
