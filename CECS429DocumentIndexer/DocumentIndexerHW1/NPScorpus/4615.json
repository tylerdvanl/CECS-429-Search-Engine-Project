Through 2016, the centennial year of the National Park Service, visit at least three of Florida's national parks and get out in a canoe, kayak or stand-up-paddleboard and paddle for 100 miles! Don't worry! You don't have to do all 100 miles at once! You'll have all year to get out and discover new places, and rediscover old favorites. Some parks may have rentals available, and some parks may offer guided paddling opportunities as well. Be sure to log your miles (download a convenient log sheet here) and take a selfie at each park. Don't forget to share your progress on social media using the hashtags #FLNPS100PaddleChallenge and #FindYourPark. When you reach 100 miles (or more!), stop into any of the national park visitor centers, show your log and your selfies, and you'll earn a specially-designed, one-of-a-kind iron-on patch to mark your achievement! Paddling at De Soto National Memorial Come launch your kayak, canoe, or paddleboard from our mangrove shorelines and explore the intersection of three major bodies of water: the Manatee River, Intercoastal Waterway, and the Gulf of Mexico. You can start from a hidden mangrove launch on the northwest shoreline of the park or through Riverview Point Preserve and explore the mouth of the Manatee River. Take a different perspective on our scenic shorelines and see the park through the eyes of an arriving Conquistador. Head north across the river to Emerson Point Nature Preserve and explore Native American middens and mangrove tunnels. Head west and paddle over lush grass flats teeming with sea life. Follow the sand bar along Seven Pines to find your way to the Intercoastal Waterway . You can stop at the popular camping destination, Gilligan's Island, and pitch a tent overnight. Even further west are the white sandy beaches of Anna Maria Island and the Gulf of Mexico. Paddlers often encounter dolphins, ospreys, ibis, pelicans, game fish, and even the occasional manatee or sea turtle.
