Many visitors enjoy recreational benefits, such as hiking and cycling, by means of the park's towpath, hiking trails, campgrounds, and other facilities. In order to coordinate special park use events it is necessary to require permits for certain activities. The Special Use Permit (SUP) program authorizes activities that provide benefit to an individual, group or organization, rather than the public at large; and that require written authorization and some degree of management control in order to protect park resources and the public interest. These activities include, but are not limited to:  Display of commercial notices or advertisements Sale or distribution of printed matter Special events Public assemblies, including first amendment right activities Possession of alcoholic beverages on park property Operating a public address system or other sound amplified audio devices Non-commercial soliciting Weddings  To protect the resources and preserve the purpose of the park, permits are also necessary for the following activities:  Commercial photography and filming Collection of research specimens and conduction of scientific research Entering closed areas of the park Construction projects conducted on or over park property Requests for events or services not offered to the general public          Scattering of Cremation Ashes Please download the Scattering of Cremation Ashes letter in order to scatter ashes from human cremains in C&O Canal National Historical Park. There are specific rules and conditions outlined in the letter that are required of all ash scattering requests. There is no fee for the scattering of ashes, but for the permit - letter to be valid, you must report in advance your intention to conduct this activity. In turn you will be given a permit number to which should be recorded on the bottom right on the permit - letter.      Regional Office Permits  Permits for first amendment rights demonstrations, special events, and\/or commercial filming and photography that take place in Montgomery County and the District of Columbia are required by C.F.R., Title 36, Chapter 1, Section 7.96 to be processed through the National Capitol Region (NCR) Park Programs Division. For C&O Canal NHP, any event that takes place between Georgetown and the Monocacy Aqueduct require a regional permit. To obtain a Regional Office Permits application and additional information, contact the NCR Park Programs Division office at (202) 245-4715 or visit the Regional Office website. To determine if your event will be processed by the park or region, please contact the Special Park Use Coordinator at (301) 745-5815.      Commercial Use Authorization  Obtain Commercial Use Application and Commercial Use Authorization Report Form. A Commercial Use Authorization (CUA) is required for businesses to conduct commercial activities within C&O Canal NHP. Businesses that bring visitors into the park who provide a product or service in exchange for payment of said services require a CUA. Examples of typical commercial operations within the park include, but are not limited to, rock climbing instruction at the Carderock climbing area, access to the Potomac River through C&O Canal NHP, bike tours utilizing the park's historic towpath, horseback riding tours in authorized areas, and shuttle services utilizing C&O Canal NHP parking lots.      Permit Fees & Cost Recovery   As directed by Congress, the National Park Service collects a fee to recover the cost of administering permits. Recoverable fees are charged for permits as described in 16 U.S.C. 3a, 31 U.S.C. 9701, and National Park Service Guidelines for Special Park Uses. The following charges are established for special use, commercial filming and photography permits for C&O Canal National Historical Park.   An Application Charge must accompany the application for a permit. This charge covers the costs involved in analyzing and processing the request for an application including secretarial, printing, mailing costs and the administrative charge. This is a non-refundable fee that must be remitted with the completed application.   Special Use Permit application fee - $200.00 Commercial Use Authorization application fee - $300.00 Commercial Photography\/Filming application fee - $200.00 Commercial Filming Location Fees - $200.00 plus location fee    In addition to the permit application fee, all commercial filming permits and still photography permits are statutorily subject to cost recovery and a location fee. No waivers are allowed. The location fee is calculated per day and must be based on the following schedule and is determined by the type of activity (commercial filming versus still photography) and the number of people on park lands associated with the permitted activity.      Commercial Filming & Photography   Commercial Filming & Photography Application  Commercial Filming\/Videos:  2-10 people $150\/day 11-30 people $250\/day 31-49 people $500\/day 50 people or more $750\/day  Still Photography:  1-10 people $50\/day1 1-30 people $150\/day 30 people or more $250\/day  An Administrative Charge reflects the actual costs incurred by the National Park Service in processing the permit, from its inception to final approval. It also includes all our costs associated with Natural and\/or Cultural compliance. This cost recovery element for basic events, subject to determination by the park's permit coordinator, is included in the above listed application charges. Monitoring Costs cover the actual costs incurred by the park accomplishing the required monitoring or management of the permit. This cost is determined on a case-by-case basis. An estimate of the monitoring cost will be provided to the permittee before a Bill for Collection is sent.       Refundable Bond  Some projects involve activities which have a high potential for damage to resources, or a high potential for intense site restoration. In those cases, NPS may require the posting of a refundable bond. The bond amount is determined by estimating the cost of monitoring and site restoration, if the permittee failed to adequately care for or complete the clean up the site.  If it is not needed, the bond is released when the on-site NPS representative signs off that site restoration is complete and all site use charges have been paid. If you fail to complete the clean-up or pay all site use and monitoring costs, NPS will restore the site and use the bond to reimburse the actual costs of monitoring and site restoration, plus the cost of processing the payment. If a surplus remains after the costs have been reimbursed, the surplus is returned to the permittee. If the bond does not cover all the costs, we will bill you for the difference.      Paying Permit Application Fees Online by Credit Card  Permit fees, including permit monitoring and film location fees, can now be paid by credit card. (Check or money orders are still accepted.) Paying by credit card offers the advantage of convenience and speed, and also makes it simpler to complete a reimbursement should one be necessary.
