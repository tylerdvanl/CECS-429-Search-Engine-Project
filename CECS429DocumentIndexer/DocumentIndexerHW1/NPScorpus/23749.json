    "body": "Tyuonyi Overlook Trail         The view from Tyuonyi Overlook includes the entire southern section of Frijoles Canyon and Tyuonyi Pueblo. NPS Photo by Sally King  The Tyuonyi Overlook Trail begins at Juniper Campground and crosses the mesa to an amazing overlook of Frijoles Canyon and Tyuonyi Pueblo. The 2.2 mile round-trip trail is relatively level but prone to be dusty or muddy depending on the season. This trail is an excellent place to see the common plants of the Pinon-Juniper woodland and some even less common ones like Alligator Juniper. The trail passes a number of archeological sites. Please don't climb on the walls or remove artifacts.       Alligator Junipers get their name from their segmented bark that looks like an alligator's back.
