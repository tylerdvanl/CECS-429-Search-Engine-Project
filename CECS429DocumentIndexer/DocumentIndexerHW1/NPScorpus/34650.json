Fishing opportunities are abundant but are also regulated in order to preserve and protect fish resources. Please review the current Recreational Fishing brochure for a list  of fishing regulations and license requirements, for guidelines on ethical fishing techniques, and for planning a fishing trip  in the park. The brochure is available at entrance stations, visitor centers, campgrounds, and  the park website. In order to provide protection for eastern brook trout populations and enhance angling opportunities, Park Rangers strictly enforce regulations. If you see someone violating the regulations, please tell a Ranger or call (800) 732-0911. Thank you and happy fishing! Click here for Fishing Regulations in Shenandoah National Park.

All fish that are to be released must be carefully handled and immediately returned to the stream. Try to release fish without removing them from the water. 2. Maintain control of fish with wet hands and only a slightly firm grip. 3. Avoid contact or damage to sensitive gills. 4. Never leave litter, hooks, or spent fishing line in the park-pack it out.
