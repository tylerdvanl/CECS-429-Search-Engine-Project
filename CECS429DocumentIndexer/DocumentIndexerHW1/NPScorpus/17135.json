    "title": "George Washington Memorial Parkway: Fort Marcy",
    "body": "Fort Marcy       Fort Marcy and its counterpart, Fort Ethan Allen, were hastily planned and built to protect the Chain Bridge approach to Washington, DC during the Civil War. Its earthwork walls, trenches, rifle pits, and parade ground are among the best preserved defenses from that era. Today it is part of a wildlife corridor around the nation's capital.       Ben H. Rome       Things to Do The men who built Fort Marcy moved massive amounts of earth. They used it to build a system of trenches, high earthwork walls, gun embrasures, mortar platforms, and magazine dugouts that are still visible today. Fort Marcy and Fort Ethan Allen were connected by a series of roads and trenches. A self guiding walk traces the connection between them.
