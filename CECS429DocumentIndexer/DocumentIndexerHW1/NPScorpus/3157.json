This aquatic species often jumps into the water to escape capture. They breed year-round, and tadpoles take a year or more to reach adulthood. Lowland leopard frogs are a species of special concern at Saguaro National Park, as prolonged drought has caused pools that once held frogs to go dry. Length: 1 4\/5 - 3 2\/5 in (4.6 - 8.6 cm) Diet: Mostly insects",
