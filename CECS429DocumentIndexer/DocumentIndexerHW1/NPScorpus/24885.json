    "body": "Laws & Policies       There are many laws, regulations, and policies that govern the management of Bering Land Bridge National Preserve and regulate visitor use of this area. The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) not only created the preserve but mandates management which protects the rural Alaskan way of life, supports reindeer herding, protects a natural and cultural wonder at Serpentine Hot Springs, and protects a small remnant of the Bering Land Bridge for exploration and study. Most regulations governing visitor activities are found in Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part I, Sections 1-13.  Special Regulations are those regulations which apply only to specific geographic regions or park areas. They are found in parts Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Part 7 contains Special Regulations for parks outside of Alaska, and Part 13 contains regulations specific to Alaska.   The Park Superintendent has the authority to establish park-specific rules, known as the Superintendent's Compendium. The Compendium is reviewed and updated annually. Read through the Archeology Questions and Answers Brochure (PDF 58) to learn more about the regulations for archeological artifacts and sites.",
