    "body": "Climate Friendly Park       What is a climate friendly park? What does the term \"park greening\"? These are just different ways of saying being a better stewards of the planet. The Organic Act which created the National Park Service states that the purpose of the National Park Service is \"to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\" Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial is doing many things to help the environment and preserving it for future generations to enjoy it. Some examples are a fleet of electric carts, recycling and solar powered trash compactors, more efficient light, and more efficient heating and cooling systems in park structures.",
