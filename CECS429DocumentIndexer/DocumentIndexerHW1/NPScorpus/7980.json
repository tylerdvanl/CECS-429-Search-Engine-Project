Use extreme caution.     Be Prepared For:     Changing weather conditions, regardless of the season Long distances between developed areas Camping, lodging and other services vary seasonally         Bicycling Regulations     Bicycle riders must comply with all applicable state and federal motor vehicle regulations.   Bicycles may be ridden only on paved road surfaces and parking areas.   Bicycles, including mountain bikes, may not be ridden on trails or walkways.   Bicycle speed must be reasonable for control with regard to traffic, weather, road and light conditions.   Bicycle operators must exhibit a white light or reflector visible at least 500 feet to the front and a red light or reflector visible at least 200 feet to the rear during periods of low visibility, between the hours of sunset and sunrise, or while traveling through a tunnel.  Bicycles must be ridden single file and well to the right-hand side of the road, except when passing or turning left.  You may ride and walk on closed portions on the Parkway when the gates are closed due to inclement weather, but use extreme caution, as there may be debris, ice or snow on the road, and patrols are less frequent. If a section is closed for construction, it is closed to all traffic, including bicycles and pedestrians.           For Safe Bicycling    Wear a bicycle helmet. North Carolina law requires it for persons 16 and under and many Virginia counties do as well, but it's the safe thing to do regardless of your age. Be sure your bicycle is in good condition. Carry a spare tube and tools for minor repairs. Wear high visibility clothing. It sets you apart from the scenery and makes you more visible to motorists. Avoid the Parkway during periods of low visibility. Fog and rain may occur unpredictably. Reschedule your trip for better weather or follow lower elevation routes until weather conditions improve. Temperatures vary greatly along the Parkway. Wear your clothing in layers. Safe drinking water is available on a seasonal basis at all picnic areas, campgrounds, concession operations, and visitor centers. Water from streams and springs is unsafe for drinking unless you purify it. Make an honest evaluation of your abilities before beginning a bicycle trip on the Parkway. In some sections, you will climb over one thousand feet in just a few miles. Take a look at our bicycling brochure to see the elevation gain for each section of the Parkway.  When cycling in a group, adjust your spacing to allow motor vehicles to pass safely.  Exercise caution when riding through tunnels. There are 26 tunnels in North Carolina and 1 tunnel in Virginia.",
