Through understanding, park visitors will appreciate the significance of the missions, and help to preserve them.  Volunteer-in-Parks (VIPs) are public-spirited people of all ages, walks of life, and educational backgrounds. Though they are individually different, they share a common interest – a love for the missions and national parks, and a desire to impart their enthusiasm and knowledge to others.  VIPs supplement the efforts of full-time employees. Tasks include everything from conducting wildlife and plant surveys to leading guided tours to performing clerical duties to maintaining park facilities.      For more information regarding San Antonio Missions National Historical Park volunteer program, please contact the Park Volunteer Coordinator.  Current Volunteer Opportunities are available online.",
