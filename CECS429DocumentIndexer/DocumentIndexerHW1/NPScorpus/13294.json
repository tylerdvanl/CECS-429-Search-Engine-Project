    "body": "Slacklining       Fixed or tensioned ropes, lines, or other devices are popping up all over the place. The National Park Service worked with local \"slackers\" to create a slackline policy: The Rules  These can't create a hazardous condition  These can't cross a road or trail  These may not be over any lake or watercourse  These may not be attached to oak trees When these are attaches to trees, the tree must be padded to minimize damage to trees These may be left unattended when they comply with the rules above and when:   They are installed in housing areas within 200 feet of the owner's housing unit, and the owner has received the superintendent's approval They are installed in Camp 4, as long as they are tagged to identify the registered camper who owns them and are within 200 feet of the Camp 4 boundary     The Reasons  Fixed or tensioned lines can present a significant hazard to other visitors and negatively impact the park's scenic values. However, the repeated installation of slack lines in the same area may cause more resource damage than lines left in place. Oaks are declining in parts of California and the groves in Yosemite Valley are not reproducing successfully. Anyone who has spent any time learning the art of slacking knows how damaging these lines can be to trees. There are many ways to pad and protect the anchor trees (carpet, sticks, sleeping pads, haul bags, clothing, etc.), but make sure whatever you do is working.",
