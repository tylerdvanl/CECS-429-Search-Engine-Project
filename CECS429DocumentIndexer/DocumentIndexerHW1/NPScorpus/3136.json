They have extremely similar songs and habits.  Because they are similar in color, the male Pyrrhuloxia is often mistaken for a female cardinal.  One easy way to tell them apart is the yellowish parrot-like bill of the pyrrhuloxia, versus the cardinal's red bill. Length: 8.75 in. Wingspan: 12 in. Diet: Seeds, berries, and insects",
