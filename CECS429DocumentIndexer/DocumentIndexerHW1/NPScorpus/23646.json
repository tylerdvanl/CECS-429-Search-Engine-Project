The following six species of owls have been identified from Bandelier National Monument. Flammulated Owl, Western Screech Owl, Great Horned Owl, Northern Pygmy Owl, Spotted Owl, and Northern Saw-whet Owl Depending on size, owls feed on everything from rodents, including squirrels, to insects and lizards. They tend to be watchers who sit patiently until prey comes within striking distance for them to quickly swoop down and carry them away.  Â     The Northern Pygmy Owl is the most often seen owl in the park, maybe because it is one of the few owls to hunt during the day. Photo by Sally King",
