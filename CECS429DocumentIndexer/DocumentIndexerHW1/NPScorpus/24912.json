It forms a plateau of volcanic rock that is up to 200 feet (61 m) high and covers 900 square miles (2,330 sq. km). Creating this plateau were 75 volcanic vents or openings in the Earth's surface that release lava. The vents were mainly found inside volcanic cones which are small hills made when lava erupts from a vent. Lava flowed from these many cones onto the land, where it cooled, hardened, and became the volcanic field we see today.",
