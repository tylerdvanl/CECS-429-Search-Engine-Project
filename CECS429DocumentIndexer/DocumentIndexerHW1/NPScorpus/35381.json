Focusing on Virginia's Standards of Learning (SOLs) requirements, Colonial NHP offers educational programs for both Jamestown (the site of the establishment of the first permanent English settlement in North America) and Yorktown (the site of the last major battle of the American Revolutionary War). Groups can take advantage of either classroom-style programs or ranger-led walking tours, either of which can be reserved for available weekdays from October through May. There is a $30.00 fee for each program.  Groups unable to take part in a ranger-led program can explore either historic site on their own. Although Colonial NHP is a National Fee Area, educational institutions are eligible to apply for an academic fee waiver. For more information about how to obtain an Academic Fee Waiver click on the more link.       TRAVELING TRUNKS  Bring the park to your classroom. Borrowing the traveling trunk is free.
