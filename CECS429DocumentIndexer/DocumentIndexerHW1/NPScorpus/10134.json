NPS Photo  The Scale House, built in 1829, was used as a storage facility for the scales and other equipment required to weigh cargo that was unloaded from a ship. The scales were never used in this building. Rather, they were carted to the wharf and assembled alongside a recently returned vessel. There, the goods were weighed and measured, and later duties were assessed on the cargo.      For More Information: The Salem Custom House The U.S. Custom Service in Salem Issues of our occasional publication, Pickled Fish and Salted Provisions “A Large Scale Enterprise” Volume 4, Number 1 (143 KB pdf files)",
