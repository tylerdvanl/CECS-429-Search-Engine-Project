Resource Stewardship Scout Ranger Program Brochure Earn A Merit Badge Using Capulin Volcano's Resources  Capulin Volcano National Monument offers a unique opportunity to study geology. Rangers have developed a workbook and activities to help boy scouts earn their geology merit badge during their visit to our park. Some or all of the requirements for the geology merit badge can be fulfilled using the workbook; however, Scoutmasters must review the workbook and determine if scouts have completed their requirements.  This workbook and associated activities are designed to be done as a group. Remember, Capulin Volcano employees are not registered Merit Badge Councilors. Scouts should refer to the District Merit Badge Councilor list available from their Scoutmaster. Click the link below to download the workbook.
