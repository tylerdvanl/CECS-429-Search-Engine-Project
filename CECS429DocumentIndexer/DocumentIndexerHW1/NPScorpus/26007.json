Monthly Narrative Report of December: First elevator breakdown occurred on December 15, 1935. Problem was \"a defective resistance coil and the precipitation of moisture on switches and other controls from the cooling of the warm moist air rising through the shaft from the Cave.\" It now appears that this trouble will recur frequently during cold weather unless the elevator door openings at both landings in the cave are made airtight by the construction of special entryways resembling storm doors. It is contemplated that this work will be done in January.     1936   Cave entrance reconstructed - trap door replaced with \"natural looking\" entrance. Rewiring of long route begun.

Rushmore, Badlands & Jewel Cave. Visitation dropped by 50.88% from 19,174 in 1942 to 9,757. A 5-ton rock was dislodged by frost action and blocked the cave at the foot of the first flight of stairs. Maintenance problems: electrical generating units had numerous breakdowns, water filling the sump at the foot of elevator shaft, deterioration of road from heavy truck traffic. Sawdust burners were installed in 5 residences to save from buying fuel oil.     1945   A small amount of water continues to seep through the wall of the elevator shaft (first occurred in 1943). Buffalo tested for brucellosis results showed that 85% of herd might be reactors. Maintenance on Game Fence started.     1946    Park boundary expanded to include most of Custer Recreational Demonstration Area and Federal Game Sanctuary (28,059.26 acres). Concession opened for the first time since the 1942 travel season. A large 8-ton limestone fragment broke off and blocked the trail near the walk-in entrance. Tentative plans for making a double cave entrance door are in the making. Brucellosis infection in bison herd is being brought under control by vaccinating all calves. Maintenance of Game Fence is still #1 priority on our maintenance and rehabilitation programs. Interior finish of the Elevator Building has suffered much damage from the moisture carried up the shaft.     1947   Devil's Tower NM established in 1906, put under Wind Cave management. Park visitation and usage increased 305% over the last pre-war travel years. 85,144 visitors entered the park. On August 9, 1946 Park was increased from 11,718 acres to 28,059 acres. Poaching has become a serious problem. Highway patrol was discontinued due to need of using all rangers for guide duty; consequently, there was much indiscriminate driving off the road. June 20 - 4.25\" of rain fell in 4 hrs and 3.25\" in the next 30 hours. It caused damage to water and sewer lines, telephone lines, washed out surfacing and destroyed electrical wires in first 500' of cave, destroyed 10 flood gates and washed out section of North-South highway, destroyed many sections of fence. Cost of repair will be $10,000 -$15,000. The elevator was the cause of considerable concern and failed to operate properly much of the time. Much work needs to be done in addition to the usual quarterly inspections. It is believed that a safety test is needed, as such a test has not been made since the installation of the elevators. Floodgates in fence all need to be replaced. Black Hills Power & Light Co. completed construction of their line to the park in November. Park has received 24-hr. electrical service since that date. Cost less than running our old diesel unit 16 hrs\/day.     1948   Wind Cave Superintendent supervised Badlands, Devils Tower, Fossil Cycad and Jewel Cave National Monuments and Mount Rushmore National Memorial. Poaching of park animals continues to be a vexing problem. Building rehabilitation consisted of interior & exterior painting of the Administrative Building and some of the residential buildings. The bulk of the flood damage incurred on June 20, 1947 was cleaned up and repaired. The North-South highway requires extensive repairs. It is the poorest stretch on U.S. 85A between Edgemont and Custer, SD.           | Top of Page |    1950   William J. Watson - Acting Superintendent (May 5).     1951   Earl M.
