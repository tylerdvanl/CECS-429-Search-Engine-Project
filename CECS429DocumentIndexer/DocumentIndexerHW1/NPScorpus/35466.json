Volunteers have spent countless hours helping preserve Timpanogos Cave and the surrounding resources. Help is appreciated from individuals or groups. There are many ways people can help.  BATS - Behind A Tour Specialists are typically teens ages 14-18 whose primary responsibility is to follow the tours and help the rangers with whatever is needed. Typically the last one in the tour group, they keep an eye on visitors to see if assistance is needed and to ensure the cave is well protected. The first step to joining the BATS program is to fill out an application online. Once the application has been completed select the day that works the best for you and sign up for training. Trail Patrol Volunteers - Adult volunteers help patrol the trail, assisting people as needed when they hike, being a uniformed presence on the trail, reminding about the rules if necessary, and being available to help a lost child or hiker in distress. If you're interested in becoming an adult volunteer, fill out an online application. Service - Volunteers help staff the information desk in the visitor center, work  in a cave restoration group, or assisting with re-vegetation projects. Youth groups and others are welcome to come and work on one-time projects, as well as projects for Boy Scout or Girl Scout advancement. Student interns work with every division in the park, depending on the student's area of focus. For information on volunteering in any division, call the Timpanogos Cave Volunteer Coordinator at (801) 756-5239 To learn about volunteer opportunities at other national park sites, click here.",
