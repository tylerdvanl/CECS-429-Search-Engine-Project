    "body": "Hiking and Walking Trails        Hiking the Bison Pasture Trail. NPS\/E. Leonard   Â    Chickasaw National Recreation Area is a place where natural beauty meets history in harmony. Meander along any of the hiking trails. They will offer you a delightful experience. In the same hike, you can view the intricate and artistic rock work done by the Civilian Conservation Corps, catch a glimpse of a beaver building a dam or a bison grazing on the prairie. Water has always been the reason people are drawn to this area. Many of the park trails in the Platt Historic District hug the banks of the streams, pass by the cool rushing waterfalls, and encircle the mineral water and freshwater springs. In the Arbuckle District the trails offer panoramic views of Lake of the Arbuckles. Trail descriptions will help you choose your route. The trails vary in length, difficulty, and scenery. Though wilderness backcountry hiking is not available, many natural settings are only minutes away from your vehicle. Sturdy tennis shoes are satisfactory on most trails; hiking shoes may be worn if preferred. Only major trails are described. There are many lesser-used side trails that connect the trails system and can be used to vary your route. Please do not create new shortcut trails. Chickasaw National Recreation Area is an ecotone, or meeting place, where two different ecosystems overlap - the eastern deciduous forest and the mixed-grass prairie. Hikers, birdwatchers, and wildflower enthusiasts enjoy the variety this diverse ecosystem has to offer.
