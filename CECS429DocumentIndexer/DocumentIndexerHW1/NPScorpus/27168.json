    "body": "Explore This Park    Get Involved     Planning     General Management Plan              General Management Plan      The National Park Service is required to maintain an up-to-date General Management Plan (GMP) for each unit of the park system. The purpose of each GMP is to ensure that the park has a clearly defined direction for asset preservation and visitor use. This basic foundation for decision-making is to be developed by an interdisciplinary team, in consultation with relevant offices within the Park Service, other federal and state agencies, interested parties and the general public. The General Management Plan should be based on use of scientific information related to existing and potential asset conditions, visitor experiences, environmental impacts and relative costs of alternative courses of action. The GMP should take the long view, which may project many years into the future, when dealing with time frames. The plan should consider the park in its full ecological, scenic, and cultural contexts as a unit of the National Park Service and as part of a surrounding region.
