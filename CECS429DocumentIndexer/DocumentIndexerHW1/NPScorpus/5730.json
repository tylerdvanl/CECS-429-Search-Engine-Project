Â    Fire has the potential to change landscapes more often than volcanoes, earthquakes or even floods. Such forces of change are completely natural and often necessary. Plants and animals have evolved with, and many depend on, the role fire plays in creating and maintaining a diversity of habitats. Fire managers at Big Cypress National Preserve follow a comprehensive fire plan that allows the restoration of fire regimes through a full range of management tools. Natural fire, prescribed fire, hazard fuel reduction, and fire effects monitoring help restore natural processes while providing for firefighter and public safety.",
