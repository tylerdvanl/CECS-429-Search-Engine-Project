The collection is one of the most diverse varieties of WWII home front items in the country and includes: written narratives, oral histories, defense industry equipment, artifacts and ephemera, photographs, and personal belongings from the WII home front.  The collection at Rosie the Riveter\/WWII Home Front National Historical Park consists primarily of stories and memorabilia that are donated to the park by ordinary individuals who experienced the WWII home front era first hand. The collection therefore represents a highly personal, unique narrative of everyday life on the home front. Donations to the collection have come from cities all across the nation and represent a diverse array of experiences from men, women, and children of all racial\/ethnic backgrounds. As of January 2016, the collection numbers over 5,000 historic artifacts and over 15,000 archival documents and continues to grow.   Museum and Archives collections have an important place in the mission of the National Park Service. Nearly every unit of the National Park Service has some form of a museum and archives collection. These collections may include historic objects, natural history specimens, archeology, and archives. Museum and archives collections offer tangible evidence of who we were and who we are as a society. Museum and archives collections are available to the public through exhibitions, web exhibits, and research. For more information about museum collections in the NPS, please click here.
