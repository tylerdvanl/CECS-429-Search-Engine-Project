At the visitor center, youth of all ages can \"Build Your Own Fort\" and discover the park's Junior Ranger Station!  Backyard Rangers is a monthly educational series which creates connections between youth and parks through diverse park programs and inspires kids to get outside and experience their America. Children of all ages are welcome to join these special programs!  How about becoming a Girl Scout or Boy Scout Resource Stewardship Ranger and learn how to become a steward of your National Parks?  Another way to explore the park is the Junior Ranger Booklet. It is available at the visitor center and online, and it is open to children of ALL ages!  Have fun and explore the park web pages! There are many park activities you can do right from your own home!     **Remember, children should only use the internet with the permission of their parents or guardians**           Image Courtesy Danielle P., Girl Scout Troop 245 of NYPENN Pathways Council        return to: top of page For Kids Fort Stanwix Main Page",
