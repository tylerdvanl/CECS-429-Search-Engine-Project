As you drive through the park, you will notice many dead spruce trees. The beetle is responsible for these dead trees. The beetle lays its eggs in the bark of the Engelmann Spruce trees. The beetle larvae tunnel through the live wood of the tree, cutting off the flow of water and nutrients to the tops of the trees. After the second year of infestation the tree's needles turn brown and fall off indicating the tree's demise. To learn more about why the trees are dying, visit our brochure discussing this topic.",
