    "body": "Explore This Park    Learn About the Park     Management             Management      Park Overview Missouri National Recreational River (MNRR) was established by Congress to protect the natural, cultural, and recreational resources of two remaining free-flowing segments of the Missouri River in as natural a state as possible and to keep them available for the public, now and in the future. The park was established under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act with an amended mandate, hence the name Recreational in lieu of the \"Wild\" and\/or \"Scenic\" terms in the park's name. The park was established by two distinct pieces of legislation more than a decade apart.  In 1978 - Congess designated the 59 mile reach of the MNRR stretching from about one mile below Gavins Point Dam to Nebraska's Ponca State Park. In 1991 - Congress designated the 39 mile reach of the MNRR which begins immediately downstream from Fort Randall Dam at Pickstown, South Dakota, and continues to Running Water, South Dakota. This section also consists of the lower 20 miles of the Niobrara River and 8 miles of Verdigre Creek.  Management of the Park The Superintendent and park staff work to preserve, protect, interpret, restore, and enhance the Recreational River's exceptional natural and cultural resources for the enjoyment of present and future generations. The Acts of Congress that created Missouri National Recreational River are called enabling legislation.  The features that make this park uniquely qualified as a unit of the National Park Service are called Outstandingly Remarkable Values (ORVs).  Park managers work with local communities, state and federal agencies, tribal authorities, the general public and numerous other partners to insure that visitors can experience this incredibly diverse and dynamic landscape.
