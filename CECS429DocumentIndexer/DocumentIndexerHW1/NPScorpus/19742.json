    "body": "Invasive Species       Invasive species (also known as exotic or non-native species) present a threat to native ecosystems. Not only do invasive plants outcompete native plant species by draining soil resources and blocking sunlight, but by doing so they often impact native wildlife by eliminating their food sources and habitats. Invasive animals become problems in similar ways: they eliminate food supplies for native animals and with no natural predators, they can reproduce at prolific rates. There are a few easy ways to help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species. Follow the links below for more information: Invasive Plants Invasive Animals",
