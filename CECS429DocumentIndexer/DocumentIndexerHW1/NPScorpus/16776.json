The sprawling facility is the latest addition to the National Chavez Center on 187 acres of oaks and spectacular rock outcroppings where Cesar lived and worked his last quarter century. Also there is a 7,000-square foot visitor center hosting Cesar's carefully preserved office and library, gallery and museum spaces, a multi-media room and book store plus the beautifully landscaped memorial gardens where he is buried.   American Latino Heritage Fund  The American Latino Heritage Fund (ALHF) of the National Park Foundation seeks to immediately and strategically integrate and celebrate the cultural, economic and civic contributions of Latino communities in our American story.",
