Field trips have been a part of education through the ages for good reasons. Effective field trip activities facilitate learning that is difficult to achieve in the regular classroom. Subjects like history and science jump off the pages of textbooks and come alive on field trips, taking on real-world relevance for students. Good field trips are multi-sensory, emphasize active learning and appeal to students with a variety of learning styles. They stimulate imagination and challenge students to think in new ways.  Field trips:    Provide accurate, first-hand historical and scientific information    Form a link between school and community    Provide opportunities for citizenship education    Help students establish a greater sense of pride in where they live     Field trips also help students make important personal connections with the cultural and natural resources that are part of our natural heritage. These connections are the first steps toward developing a conservation ethic and ultimately becoming stewards for our shared park lands.
