East Montezuma Canyon Road is paved for one mile west of the visitor center, then it is a narrow, unpaved mountain road (24 ft. vehicle length limit) to the scenic overlook at Montezuma Pass. The dirt road continues west into the Coronado National Forest. Periodic road closures to Montezuma Pass may occur during inclement weather conditions.  Allow approximately two hours to tour the visitor center, drive to the scenic overlook, and walk to Coronado Peak. A trip to Coronado Cave also takes about two hours. Hiking to Montezuma Pass - via Joe's Canyon Trail - or the US-Mexico border - via Joe's Canyon & Yaqui Ridge Trails - takes several hours, depending on your route.",
