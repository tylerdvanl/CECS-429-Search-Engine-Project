The EA includes analysis of the proposed action, as well a no action alternative. New! A Finding of No Significant Impact has been finalized for this project. The purpose of the proposed project is to improve NPS staff and community safety, increase energy efficiency, protect National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) listed cultural resources, and reduce labor and budgetary costs associated with the park's utility infrastructure. The proposed project is needed because the utility system currently in use (electricity, water, wastewater, gas, and telecommunications) is ineffective, inefficient, and difficult to repair. The proposed project would replace the current utility infrastructure by undertaking the following: replacing existing overhead powerlines with underground lines, and then removing overhead lines; replacing water and sewer lines; updating telecommunication lines; replacing small, building-specific propane tanks with two centralized, large propane tanks; improving utilities at the seasonal staff housing area south of Highway 36E; and updating site lighting.
