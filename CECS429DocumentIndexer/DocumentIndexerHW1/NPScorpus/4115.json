This list includes only those species that are presently or formerly known to occur within Everglades National Park.  This list does not include state-listed species.   Glossary of Terms Candidate: A species, subspecies, or isolated population (hereafter \"species\") not currently listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act, but is undergoing a preliminary review to determine status. Proposed: A species that—following a preliminary review to determine status—is proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act as either threatened or endangered. Prior to listing a species, however, the proposal must undergo a formal public review.  Threatened: A species that—following a formal public review— is determined to be very likely to become endangered in the near future unless the species or its habitat is fully protected and managed for its survival Endangered: A species that—following a formal public review—is determined to be in immediate danger of extinction unless the species or its habitat is fully protected and managed for its survival.            Species   Federal Status   Current Situation    Atlantic Ridley Turtle Endangered Casual    Lepidochelys kempii               Bachman's Warbler  Endangered  Unknown    Vermivora bachmanii                 Bartram's Scrub-Hairstreak Endangered  Breeding    Strymon acis bartrami                 Cape Sable Seaside Sparrow Endangered  Breeding     Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis               Cape Sable Thoroughwort Endangered Resident   Chromolaena frustrata           Florida Bonneted Bat  Endangered  Unknown     Eumops floridanus               Florida Leafwing Butterfly  Endangered Breeding     Anaea troglodyta floridalis               Florida Panther  Endangered  Breeding     Puma concolor coryi               Green Turtle  Endangered  Casual     Chelonia mydas               Hawksbill Turtle Endangered  Casual     Eretmochelys imbricata               Ivory-billed Woodpecker  Endangered  Formerly    Campephilus principalis                Key Largo Cotton Mouse Endangered Unknown    Peromyscus gossypinus allapaticola               Key Largo Woodrat  Endangered  Unknown   Neotoma floridana smalli               Kirtland's Warbler  Endangered  Formerly     Setophaga kirtlandii               Leatherback Turtle  Endangered  Casual?
