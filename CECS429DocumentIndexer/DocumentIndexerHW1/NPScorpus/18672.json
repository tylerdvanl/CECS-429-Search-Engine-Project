The Museum Collection The basis of the museum collection at Ford's Theatre National Historic Site is the Osborn H. Oldroyd Lincoln Collection, which Mr. Oldroyd set up in the Petersen House in 1892.  The collection contained over 3,000 items and was augmented by those artifacts related to the assassination used as state's evidence in the trial of the conspirators.  Oldroyd maintained his collection in the Petersen House after the purchase of the house by the federal government in 1896.  The government purchased the collection itself from Oldroyd in 1926 for the sum of $50,000. Museum items include Lincoln's overcoat, Booth's derringer, Major Rathbone's gloves and the contents of Lincoln's pockets when he was killed.",
