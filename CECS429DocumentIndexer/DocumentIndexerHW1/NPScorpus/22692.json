    "body": "Feasibility Study       4-Trails Feasibility Study - The California Trail Study Routes The National Park Service (NPS) is preparing a feasibility study to evaluate some 64 routes for possible addition to the Oregon, California, Mormon Pioneer, and Pony Express National Historic Trails. This study was authorized by Congress — in response to years of sustained public interest — under the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009. The 41 California Trail study routes listed in the Act are shown in the table below.     Eastern Routes   Central Routes   Western Routes     Blue-Mills-Independence Road  Cherokee Trail, including splits  Bidwell-Bartleson     Westport Landing Road   Weber Canyon Route of Hastings Cutoff   Georgetown- Dagget Pass Trail     Westport-Lawrence Road   Bishop Creek Cutoff   Big Trees Road     Fort Leavenworth- Blue River   McCauley Cutoff   Grizzly Flat Cutoff    Road to Amazonia Diamond Springs Cutoff Nevada City Road   Union Ferry Secret Pass Yreka Trail   Old Wyoming- Nebraska City Cutoff Greenhorn Cutoff Hennes Pass   Lower Plattsmouth Central Overland Trail Johnson Cutoff   Lower Bellevue   Luther Pass Trail   Woodbury Cutoff   Volcano Road   Blue Ridge Cutoff   Sacramento-Coloma Wagon Road   Westport Road   Burnett Cutoff   Gum Springs-Fort Leavenworth   Placer County Road to Auburn   Atchison- Independence Creek       Fort Leavenworth-Kansas River       Nebraska City Cutoff       Minersville-Nebraska City Road       Upper Plattsmouth       Upper Bellevue             The eastern routes are generally situated from the east bank of the Missouri River in Iowa and Missouri, through eastern Kansas, and across Nebraska. The central routes are generally in Wyoming, northern Utah, and eastern Nevada. The western routes are in Nevada and California. Some of the study routes, such as the Overland Trail and the Bidwell-Bartleson Route, cross more than one of these geographic regions. Other trails in the feasibility study include Oregon National Historic Trail, Pony Express National Historic Trail, and Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail.
