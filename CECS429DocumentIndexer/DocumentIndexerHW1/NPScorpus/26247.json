    "title": "Fort Vancouver National Historic Site: Victorian Handcrafts",
    "body": "Victorian Handcraft Demonstrations       You are invited to step back in time and join NPS volunteers and staff at the McLoughlin House for a very special demonstration series each year, featuring handcrafts and art techniques that were popular during Queen Victoria's reign. During this time period, new materials, patterns and magazines for women became widely available, and needlework and other crafts became popular as never before. Each month in the spring and summer, our demonstrations feature a different type of art or craft - some that are still done, and some that have nearly been forgotten. Most of the demonstrations include a hands-on component. All programs are free of charge. For more information, please visit our Calendar or contact staff on Fridays and Saturdays at the McLoughlin House at 503-656-5151.   Â    Dig deeper...  McLoughlin House Victorian Cultural Demonstrations occur on the second Saturday of the month from March through November, drop in between Noon and 4:00 pm for this free program.
