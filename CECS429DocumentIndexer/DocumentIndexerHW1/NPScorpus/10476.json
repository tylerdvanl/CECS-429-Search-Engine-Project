    "body": "The Beginning of a Permanent European Presence in Northern North America  The winter of 1604-1605 on Saint Croix Island was a cruel one for Pierre Dugua's French expedition. Iced in by freezing temperatures and cut off from fresh water and game, 35 of 79 men died. As spring arrived and native people traded game for bread, the health of those remaining improved. Although the expedition moved on by summer, the beginning of French presence in North America had begun.                Francais   A French version of the website is available.        Events of 1604-1605   Discover the events that took place during the short-lived, but historically important, settlement on Saint Croix Island.        Self-Guided Trail   A short, accessible interpretive trail features bronze figures of the French and Passamaquoddy.",
