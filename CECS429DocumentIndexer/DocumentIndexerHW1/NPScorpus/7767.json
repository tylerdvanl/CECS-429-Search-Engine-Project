Your visit to the barn is a self-guided venture, although, there are park volunteers at the barn who would be happy to answer any questions you may have about Mrs. Sandburg's Chikaming goatherd. Remember to wash up after visiting the goats and please do not bring any food or drink into the barnyard.

It is approximately 12 minutes in length and can be viewed by approximately 20 people at a time. Hiking: Mr. Sandburg used to take his chair out to some of the rock outcroppings along the trail to sit and write or just to sit. He enjoyed observing his natural surroundings.

We encourage you to pick up a map at the park bookstore when planning your hike. Ranger Programs: During the summer National Park Service rangers give 30 minute programs about a myriad of Sandburg related topics from bird walks to cultural landscape walks, cheese making demonstrations to sharing the letters of Carl and Paula Sandburg. Please check with the ranger at the park bookstore for the times and topics of these programs. Bookstore: Eastern National, in cooperation with the National Park Service, maintains a bookstore with a great variety of educational materials about Carl Sandburg, the natural environment, the civil war, and literature for young people.
