The museum collection also documents Lilian \"Paula\" Sandburg's contributions to the American dairy goat industry, her Connemara Farms business, and her Chikaming herd. Over 50,000 original furnishings decorate the historic house, giving visitors a chance to travel back in time to the late 1950s and experience the lifestyle of a uniquely American family. The museum collection includes archival and object collections relating to Carl Sandburg in addition to archival, specimen, and object collections relating to park management, preservation of historic structures and cultural landscapes, and inventorying and monitoring programs.
