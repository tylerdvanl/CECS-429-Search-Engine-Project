    "body": "Work With Us       The National Park Service seeks students, professionals and other qualified individuals from numerous academic disciplines and trades for a wide variety of internship, seasonal and permanent positions available nation-wide. We encourage all interested and qualified persons to apply for jobs. We want a workforce that reflects the diversity of America. You must be a United States citizen to be eligible for consideration for employment. Certain jobs may also have age and physical qualifications. Generally, you must be at least 18 years of age. The National Park Service fills all positions in accord with U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations. Normally, a person seeking an initial appointment to a permanent position must gain eligibility on an appropriate OPM register. Employment with the National Park Service is available in both permanent and seasonal positions. How Jobs Are Filled Federal agencies fill jobs in several ways. Not all jobs are open to external applicants. Agencies can: promote an employee; hire an employee who wants to transfer from another agency; reinstate a former Federal employee; or request the names of applicants from an OPM register. Your Application If you are pursuing your first Federal Government position, the best source of information is the job announcement. It will explain what the job duties are, what experience or education is necessary to qualify, the pay, and where to send your application.
