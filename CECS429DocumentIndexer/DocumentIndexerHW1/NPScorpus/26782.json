British forces, led by Sir Ralph Abercrombie, again tried to take control of one of the most strategic locations in the New World, Puerto Rico.  A powerful military outpost, key to the Spanish Empire and doorway to the riches of the Americas, Puerto Rico had been long coveted by nations for its strategic location. Against odds, the attackers were repelled by a determine force of defenders.  Spanish soldiers, members of the Puerto Rican Fixed Regiment, Puerto Rican Disciplined Militias and citizens valiantly defended San Juan with the impregnable fortifications behind them.  From April 27th to 28th, 2013 the 1797 defense of San Juan will be commemorate with military drills firing demonstration and educational programs.
