    "body": "Support Your Park          It is important to support our National Parks and T.R. did so in many ways. In this photo, Theodore Roosevelt, naturalist John Muir, and others are standing at the base of the sequoia Grizzly Giant Tree in Mariposa Grove, Yosemite. This was taken on Roosevelt's 1903 western tour. The trip greatly influenced Roosevelt who set forth to designate and protect national forests, parks, and wildlife preserves, many of which would be incorporated into the National Park Service when it was formed in 1916. It was his dedicated support that allows us to enjoy the wonder of our National Parks to this day. Learn more about supporting us through our friends groups and cooperating association.",
