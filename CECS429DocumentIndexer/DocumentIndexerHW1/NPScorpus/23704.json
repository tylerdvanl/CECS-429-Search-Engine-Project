NPS Photo by Sally King  Bandelier's wildflower season usually lasts from mid-April until the first heavy frost (usually mid to late October). The volume and diversity of flowers in any given season is heavily dependent on precipitation. A winter with heavy snows often heralds a spring of abundant blooms as does a late summer with repetitive local afternoon showers. Some flowers bloom all season long, often becoming less abundant during the hottest part of summer only to resurge with the start of the rainy season. Other wildflowers can only be found during limited seasons and in specific areas of the park.  Â     Antelope's Horn is one of several types of milkweed that grows in the park.
