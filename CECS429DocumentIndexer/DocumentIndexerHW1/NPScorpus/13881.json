    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Safety            Safety       President's Park is an urban park located in the middle of one of the country's largest metropolitan areas. Washington, DC is a walking city. When visiting be prepared to walk to many of the places you want to visit. For your safety, please use crosswalks and obey crossing signals. Before or after your walk, stop at the White House Visitor Center to see the exhibits and video on the White House and its history. Observe park wildlife such as gray squirrels, migratory birds, and the occasional red-tailed hawk or bald eagle. For your safety, please do not feed the squirrels. They will bite. The closest Metrorail stations to the White House are Federal Triangle (blue, orange, and silver lines) and Metro Center (red, blue, orange, and silver lines). Because on-street parking is limited, we strongly encourage you to use public transportation.  Please be prepared to be flexible in traveling through the area, as temporary security measures are sometimes needed in President's Park. Certain areas of the park may be closed on a temporary basis at the request of the US Secret Service to ensure necessary security and safety for the adjacent White House complex, its occupants, and the public. Public tours of the White House are available free of charge for individuals or groups. Requests must be submitted through one's Member of Congress and are accepted up to six months in advance. For more information, visit the White House Tours page.                 The closest hospital is approximately eight blocks from the White House Visitor Center. George Washington University Hospital is located on 901 23rd Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20037 or call 202-715-4000.              Also, please see the Law and Policies page for additional information and regulations.",
