    "body": "Explore This Park    Learn About the Park     Nature     Environmental Factors               Environmental Factors          Monocacy National Battlefield was established by Congress in 1934, with the intention of protecting and conserving the natural, historic, and cultural resources found within the park. There are a number of factors which directly influence the way the park is managed. These factors include air and water quality, urbanization, flood risk, high wildlife populations, and invasive species. Since the park is being constricted by urbanization from Frederick City and Urbana, it serves as a wildlife sanctuary that is guaranteed to never be developed. With the population of Frederick County increasing annually, greater concerns are directed toward air and water quality management as well as resource protection. It is inevitable that the encroachment from the City of Frederick will continue throughout the coming years, therefore many future challenges lie ahead for park management at the battlefield.",
