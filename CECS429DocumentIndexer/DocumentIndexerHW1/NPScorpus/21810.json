NPS Photo \/ Matthew Cahill       Biking can be a wonderful way to experience Lake Clark National Park in the winter. Traditionally winter has been a time of movement in the Alaskan environment when frozen lakes and rivers open country to transportation. Fat tire bikes work particularly well in this environment and studded tires allow riders to ride directly on ice. Like all travel in remote wilderness environments, thorough planning and understanding the environment and risks are important. Preplanning winter bike trips can be challenging due to unknown weather and ice conditions. Late winter (February and March) often offers the longest daylight, best winter weather, and strongest ice conditions.  Why is biking allowed in Alaska’s national parks but not in parks in the lower-48? Biking is allowed in parks, preserves, and wilderness areas created by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (ANILCA). This does not preclude the National Park Service from closing land to protect natural and cultural resources, which has been done in some of the parks created by ANILCA. Please check rules in each park before riding.",
