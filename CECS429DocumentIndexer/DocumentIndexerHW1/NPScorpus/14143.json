Construction of the acequia began a year later. Hand dug and made of dressed limestone, the acequia diverted water from San Antonio River through agricultural fields that belonged to San Antonio de Valero Mission. Acequia Madre de Valero was the initial phase of what became a 45-mile acequia network put in place to provide water for the missions and their agricultural endeavors.
