Junior Ranger Booklet        Junior civil War Historian Patch   Junior Civil War Historian Program One hundred fifty years ago, our nation nearly tore itself apart. Soldiers in blue and gray struggled on battlefields across the country and changed the face of the United States of America. Now you can visit these special places and become a Junior Civil War Historian as our nation remembers what that conflict means to us today.      There are two ways to become a Junior Civil War Historian. Option 1 Become a Junior Ranger at three (3) participating parks. Make sure you get a ranger to initial and date your activity card or your Junior Ranger program booklets. Once you have become a Junior Ranger at three parks, turn in your activity card or Junior Ranger program booklets at a participating park to receive your patch. Option 2 Become a Junior Ranger at two (2) participating parks and do one online activity. Turn in your activity card or Junior Ranger program booklets along with a printout of your completed online activity at a participating park to receive your patch.",
