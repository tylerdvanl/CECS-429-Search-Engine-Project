Joseph Bancroft was a member of the original Hopedale communityy, and in 1856 he cast the lone vote against the dissolution of the community. He remained a life-long friend of Adin Ballou and became a business partner to the Drapers. With a strong interest in improving community life, he provided the money to build this distinguished building, which he dedicated to his wife. The library houses a small collection of artifacts and memorabilia, including Adin Ballou's cradle and writing desk, as well as some fine portraits of Hopedale's founders.      Jump to Introduction 1 Adin Ballou Park 2 Factory Site 3 Little Red Shop 4 The Parklands 5 Dutcher Street Company Housing 6 Unitarian Church and Town Hall",
