    "body": "Explore This Park    Get Involved     Support Your Park             Support Your Park       There are many way for you to support your park. The first and easiest is to come visit the Casa Grande Ruins. Statistics do matter when the parks compete for funding and other benefits. Fee revenue helps support special projects and upgrades. You can also volunteer to help at the park. From maintenance to public speaking there is a wealth of opportunity at Casa Grande Ruins. Do you want to come on a regular schedule (for example, come in every Wednesday) or would you prefer to come only for special events (such as working with school groups which tends to be irregular but fun!)? Look at the volunteer page for more ideas of what you might do. Purchasing items from our cooperating association bookstore helps since the bookstore, operated by Western National Parks Association, is non profit. All money earned goes to supporting the parks. As an added bonus- no sales tax. Think of it as a 10% discount on what you buy. Donating to park is greatly appreciated. There are some items, such as props or art supplies for children's programs, that just wouldn't get purchased if not donated or funded through donated money. And if you are truly enthused about the Casa Grande Ruins please consider joining our Friends Group. They have special tours and events, plus help the park in ways that just fill those empty spots of needs.
