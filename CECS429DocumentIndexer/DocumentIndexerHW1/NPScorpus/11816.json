A lack of native predators of the bullfrog has resulted in significant impacts on the native amphibian, reptile, and fish populations due to bullfrog predation. Bullfrogs eat practically anything that they can catch and swallow, including terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates, fish, other frogs, turtles, snakes, birds, mammals, etc. With limited population control, these amphibians can cause significant harm to an ecosystem before being eaten or moving on to a new habitat.         Youâ€™ll find them in the freshwater habitats (streams, marshes, stagnant waters, ditches, canals, lakes etc) in the Santa Monica Mountains. What you can do! Stop releasing your pets into the wild! Bullfrogs are hardy animals and just one individual can decimate a large area. Cease intentional stocking of bullfrogs for sport and encourage others to keep native frogs as pets.",
