They are predators of many animals, some of which are pests, and they are prey for other animals in the food web. Reptiles are declining worldwide. The primary cause is habitat loss, but commercialization for food and skins, disease, introduced species, environmental pollution, and global climate change cause population decline and loss. Park records list 52 species. This includes turtles, lizards, skink and snakes. A survey for herps (reptiles and amphibians) was recently completed for the Jamestown environs. That survey found eleven species of frogs, seven species of salamanders, seven species of turtles, three species of lizards, and eight species of snakes.",
