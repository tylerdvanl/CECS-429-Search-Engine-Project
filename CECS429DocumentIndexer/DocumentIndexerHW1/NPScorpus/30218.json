    "body": "Non-native Vegetation       There is a strong consensus in the fields of ecology and conservation biology that invasive exotic species pose one of the greatest threats to the integrity of native ecosystems in the U.S. and around the world. Among the most notable effects are modifications of competitive interactions, promotion of invasion by other non-indigenous plants and animals, hybridization with native species and consequent alteration of the gene pool, changes in the physical structure of ecosystems and communities, increased erosion, shifts in phenology, new disturbance patterns, and altered successional paths.
