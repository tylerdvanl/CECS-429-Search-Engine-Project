Ed Sharron  The Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller NHP is home to only a few species of reptiles, including the snapping and painted turtle as well as the milk, garter, and redbelly snakes. Turtles can be found near ponds and streams; keep quiet as you walk around the Pogue, the park's 14-acre pond, and you might see some painted turtles sunning themselves on logs. Snakes are rarer sights but can be found near trails or in long grass. None of these snakes are venomous, but it is always a good idea to respect their space and view them from a safe distance.       A garter snake takes in the last rays of “summer” on a warm November day.
