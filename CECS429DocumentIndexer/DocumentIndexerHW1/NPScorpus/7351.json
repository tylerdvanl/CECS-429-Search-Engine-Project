    "body": "Trail and Access Plan       Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area would like to invite the public to assist us in writing and establishing a Trail and Access Plan for the park. This plan will provide: ·  a comprehensive approach to travel planning and management to sustain and enhance the wide range of opportunities and experiences within the park; ·   protection of natural and cultural resources, settings, and values; and ·   provide for acceptable modes of legal public access that will protect resources, reduce conflicts, and provide an adequate quality and quantity of non-motorized and mechanized recreation.   Trail and Access management should be used to achieve desired future conditions and resource management objectives established through the planning process. Our purpose in developing this Trail and Access Plan is to identify management objectives and strategies to guide the protection, management and use of resources, roads and trails in Bighorn Canyon.   Maps and other information will be available for comments at http:\/\/parkplanning.nps.gov\/BighornTrailsPlan.  Comments can also be mailed to: Cassity Bromley Bighorn Canyon NRA 20 HWY 14 A East Lovell, WY 82431   If you have questions, please contact Cassity Bromley at 307-548-5416.
