The Platte and Crystal Rivers are favorite canoe, kayak, and inner tube rivers for families and groups.  Shalda and Otter Creeks are small streams that are favorites for fishing and viewing beaver, otter, and muskrats.  The waterways come from inland lakes and empty into Lake Michigan.  They sport annual runs of salmon and other species such as smelt that migrate in from Lake Michigan.  There are a number of wetlands associated with each, and several forest and wetland habitat types can be seen whether hiking or floating along their courses.",
