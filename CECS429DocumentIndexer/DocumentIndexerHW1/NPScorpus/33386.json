Tidepools in American Camp are especially rich with sea anemones, pink, purple, and orange sea stars, sea urchins, crabs, periwinkles, dogwinkles, great tangles of kelp and the largest chiton in the world: the gumboot.  Intertidal communities are valuable vital signs of important changes in the near-shore marine ecosystem as well as marine water quality. They are vulnerable to stressors such as pollution (e.g. oil spills), harvest, trampling, and global climate change.
