Â       BICYCLE TOURS Join us for ranger guided bicycle tours of Stones River National Battlefield on Saturdays from April 7, 2012 through October 27, 2012 at 9 AM. Get healthy exercise, reduce your carbon footprint, and learn about the major Civil War battle that occurred here in late 1862 and early 1863. This program will take visitors through the battlefield using the tour road and the Stones River Greenway. The tour is limited to 15 participants per program.  At several points during the ride, the ranger will stop to discuss the major military actions that affected the outcome of the Battle of Stones River. Some of the stories included are the fighting in Slaughter Pen, the desperate stand of the Union army along the Nashville Pike, and the terrible climax to the battle that bloodied the banks of the Stones River. Participants will meet at the visitor center at 8:45 AM with their bikes. Children, ages 16 and under must wear safety helmets, and all other participants are encouraged to wear them as well. The tour will begin at 9 AM. The ride will travel up to five miles and last 90 minutes.",
