Smallmouth bass along with rock bass and bluegill are the favored game fish. With proper respect for the river and its resources and a few safety precautions, anglers can enjoy a quality fishing experience. A West Virginia state fishing license is required. The Bluestone River, together with the nearby New and Greenbrier rivers, make this area of Southern West Virginia a great place for fishing. The natural beauty is an added bonus! Check with the WV Department of Natural Resources for fishing regulations.         For health and safety, anglers are advised to adhere to published West Virginia advisories for fish consumption. These are published annually in the fishing regulations (http:\/\/www.wvdnr.gov\/Fishing\/Fishing_regs.shtm) and can also be accessed separately from the entire regulation booklet (http:\/\/www.wvdnr.gov\/Fishing\/Regs14\/Consumption_Advisory.pdf). The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources has the same information available (http:\/\/www.wvdhhr.org\/fish\/Current_Advisories.asp), along with a little more background information (http:\/\/www.wvdhhr.org\/fish\/default.asp).",
