The amphitheater is able to accommodate groups of up to 60 people.        The entrance to Valentine Cave   Valentine Cave Tour This ranger-led program explores one of the monument's most popular lava tube caves.

The tour lasts roughly one hour, and groups larger than 30 are recommended to split into two groups request two tours.        Keintpoos, also known as Captain Jack   Captain Jack's Stronghold Walk This program takes students through Captain Jack's Stronghold, a natural lava fortress that was one of the most important sites of the Modoc War (1872-1873.) The hour-long program immerses students the culture of the Modocs while giving the progression of this tragic war including the events leading up to the conflict, victories and defeats on both sides, and the eventual outcome. Due to the narrow, enclosed nature of the Stronghold trail, groups of more than 30 are recommended to split into groups and request back-to-back tours if rangers are available.",
