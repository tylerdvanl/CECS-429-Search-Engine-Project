Â   VIP Bernie, wows over 100 CNM visitors during the partial solar eclipse!A VIP is always prepared to enhance\/broaden a visitors view of CNM. On Thursday, Oct 23, visitors we were treated to a seldom seen viewing experience of the sun and moon.  VIP Bernie shared the use of his 3x5 UV solar viewer, purchased previously from the Visitors Center.  Over 100 people witnessed the partial eclipse and were awed by the opportunity.Who would of guessed that a paper prop and the initiative of a volunteer could have an impact on so many in a short 30 minute timeframe.    Bernie Thank you, for sharing!",
