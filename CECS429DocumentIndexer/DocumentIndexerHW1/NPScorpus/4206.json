Ranger led programs are a great option to enrich your visiting experience at national parks. These are special programs created by Park Rangers who interpret the parks natural and cultural resources.  Everglades National Park increases its programs during the high visitor season (December through March), where additional seasonal rangers allow the park to provide more interpreted activities.   Note: There are three separate entrances to the park: near Homestead, near Miami and near Everglades City. Each park entrance offers unique programs focused on its surrounding resources.   To plan your visit, pick an area and check out the types of ranger guide programs you may be able to enjoy!    You can also navigate by clicking on a region to see their program offerings or check out the calendar below for an overview on daily activities throughout the park!        Flamingo  (Located 38 miles south down the Main Park Road after the main entrance station to the park near Homestead) From bird watching to ranger led talks, Flamingo has a variety of ranger-led activities.
