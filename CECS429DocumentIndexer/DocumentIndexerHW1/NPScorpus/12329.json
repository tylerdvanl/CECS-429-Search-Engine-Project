SS Red Oak Victory Ship   7 Photos  The SS Red Oak Victory is the last surviving ship built in the Kaiser Richmond Shipyards during World War II.  Today, the Red Oak Victory remains a monument to the men and women who worked in war related industries as part of the World War II Home Front. In 1998, the ship was saved from the Naval Reserve Fleet in Suisun Bay by a courageous group of men and women and has been under restoration since that time. While the Red Oak Victory is part of the WWII Home Front story, the NPS does not own or manage the ship. Please call 510-237-2933 to find out more information.            Betty Reid Soskin   5 Photos  Betty Reid Soskin (born Betty Charbonnet; 1921) is a Park ranger with the National Park Service, assigned to the Rosie the Riveter\/World War II Home Front National Historical Park in Richmond, California.           Rosie the Riveter Memorial   6 Photos  Three years before the national park was created, the City of Richmond initiated the Rosie Memorial to celebrate the important aspect of their community's history. The design uses abstracted forms of Liberty ships in sculptures reminiscent of the prefabricated ships assembled by shipyard workers. Meant to draw parallels between the acts of constructing ships and reconstructing memories, the Memorial's form is that of a vessel in the process of being built. Quotes from \"Rosies\" and a World War II timeline are incised into the granite walkway of the memorial. This memorial is the touchstone of the national park here in Richmond, and is located in Marina Bay Park.",
