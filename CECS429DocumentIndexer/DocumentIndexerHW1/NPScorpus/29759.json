As a result, its use since the mid-1880s has been extensive. The museum has a large collection of objects, paper documents and textiles that illustrate the popular use of the Statue of Liberty in hundreds of different contexts. The image in advertising is prevalent as the trade card demonstrates, incorporating the Statue as \"enlightening\" buyers to the best brand of six-cord thread on the market. Numerous whimsical toys, including Cabbage Patch™ dolls, are designed and manufactured by commercial industries for children's play and collectors' shelves. Collectors and Statue of Liberty enthusiasts have an apparently endless supply of both mass-produced and hand-made original decorative novelties for their home or holiday.       Cabbage Patch doll c. 1986 National park Service, Statue of Liberty NM       < History of the Statue of Liberty | Back to Museum Collection | The Statue of Liberty as a Symbol >",
