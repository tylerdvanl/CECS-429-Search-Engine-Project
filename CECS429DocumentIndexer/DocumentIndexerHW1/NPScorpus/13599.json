Bring and use a map or guide (don't rely on trail signs, as there are not many out there). 2. Stay hydrated—bring and drink water (water bottles and a filling station are available at the Nature Center). 3. Stay on the trail (poison ivy, a native plant, is widespread throughout the park). 4. Keep your dog leashed at all times (many hikers and park users are afraid of dogs;please be respectful of them).  5. Dress appropriately (wear sturdy shoes, dress in layers and anticipate cold and wet weather).           Create Your Own Hike  There are two primary trails that run North-South in Rock Creek Park. They are the Western Ridge Trail (green on the Park Map) and the Valley Trail (pink on the Park Map). Think of them as the rails of a ladder. There are many connector trails running mostly East-West joining the Western Ridge Trail with the Valley Trail. Think of these connectors as the rungs of a ladder. The layout of the trail system of Rock Creek Park is almost shaped like a ladder. Using this principle it is possible to create an almost infinite number of loops in lengths from about one mile to ten miles. Use the Park Map Tool to the left or get a  map at the Nature Center to help plan your hike.  Good places to start your hike include the Nature Center, Peirce Mill, Picnic areas 6-10 and Boundary Bridge.         Hiking Options         Sort By: Rating Relevance Recently Updated Title    Show 10 40  per page     Loading results...
