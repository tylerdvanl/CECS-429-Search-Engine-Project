ParkEDU's aim is to create an enriching and valuable experience for each and every student who comes our way.          Pre-Site Visits    A ParkEDU team member will come to your computer lab or classroom and give a history of the National Park Service, focusing on the WWII Valor in the Pacific National Monument site. We will also walk your students through the process of obtaining their Every Kid in a Park pass, which can emailed to the students, printed by the school, or printed at home.               Distance Learning Find out about our distance learning programs!         Professional Development  Find out more about professional development opportunities!",
