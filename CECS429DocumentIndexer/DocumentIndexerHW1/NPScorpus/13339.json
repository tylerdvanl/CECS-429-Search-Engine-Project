    "body": "Glacier Point              Glacier Point, an overlook with a commanding view of Yosemite Valley, Half Dome, Yosemite Falls, and Yosemite’s high country, is accessible by car from approximately late May through October or November. From mid-December through March, cross-country skiers can experience this view after skiing 10.5 miles.  From the Glacier Point parking and tour unloading area, a short, paved, wheelchair-accessible trail takes you to an exhilarating (some might say unnerving) point 3,214 feet above Half Dome Village (formerly Curry Village), on the floor of Yosemite Valley.   To Get There From mid-May to September, you may be required to use a free shuttle from Badger Pass to Glacier Point between 10 am to 4:30 pm when the Glacier Point parking lot fills. If you arrive at the Badger Pass turnoff before 10 am or after 4:30 pm, you can drive to Glacier Point (and all trailheads). If you arrive between 10 am and 4:30 pm and the Glacier Point parking lot is full, rangers will have you park at Badger Pass and use the free shuttle to get to Glacier Point or other locations along the Glacier Point Road. Parking is available at Badger Pass for RVs and trailers, but not for full-sized commercial buses.  The free shuttle leaves Badger Pass every 20 minutes and stops at Sentinel Dome\/Taft Point trailhead, Washburn Point, and Glacier Point. Upon request or flag-down, the shuttle stops at McGurk Meadow, Ostrander Lake, and Mono Meadow trailheads. The first shuttle leaves Badger Pass at 10 am, the last shuttle leaves Badger Pass at 4:30 pm, and the last shuttle leaves Glacier Point at 5:30 pm. (No shuttle service of any kind is available after 5:30 pm.)  Vehicles displaying accessibility placards, people with a wilderness permit for Glacier Point Road trailheads, and people camping at Bridalveil Creek Campground can drive to their destination at any time.  Please note that details above may change during the summer.   Car: The Glacier Point Road is open to cars approximately late May through October or November, depending on conditions. (View a list of opening and closing dates since 1995.) When open, you can drive to Glacier Point by traveling on the Wawona Road (the continuation of Highway 41 within the park)—either north from Wawona or south from Yosemite Valley. After traveling about 13 miles, turn on to the Glacier Point Road at the Chinquapin intersection. Driving time from Wawona and Yosemite Valley is about an hour.    Bus: The Glacier Point Tour generally operates when the Glacier Point Road is open. One-way tickets are available if you're interested in taking the bus to Glacier Point and hiking back to Yosemite Valley. (If hiking to or from Glacier Point, and expecting to take the bus back, be sure you're familiar with the bus schedule.   Activities   Birdwatching (all year)  Hiking and Walking (summer and fall) Skiing and Snowshoeing (winter)  Stargazing (all year) Ranger and Interpretive Programs (all year)   Points of Interest         Glacier Point, an overlook with a commanding view of Yosemite Valley, Half Dome, and the High Sierra is located 30 miles (one hour) from Yosemite Valley. The road ends at Glacier Point and it is a short walk to the viewpoint.         Washburn Point, just south of Glacier Point, has similar views, though the views of Vernal and Nevada Falls are a more direct.          When Yosemite Ski & Snowboard Area (formerly Badger Pass Ski Area) is open (mid to late December through March), the Glacier Point Road is groomed beyond the ski area. Cross-country skiers can follow the road for 10.5 miles to Glacier Point. This is possible as a (21-mile) day trip or as an overnight. A ski hut is open in winter (reservation required) or you can camp (with a wilderness permit, available from the Badger Pass Ranger Station without a reservation).
