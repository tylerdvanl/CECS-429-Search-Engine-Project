Traffic Laws Zion National Park, as well as other national parks, enforces the same traffic laws as other law enforcement agencies, in addition to other park specific regulations. Below are a few of specific regulations. Please keep in mind that while the location is very different from your home town, basic traffic laws are the same. Speed Zion has unique roads with narrow lanes, sharp turns, long drop-offs, beautiful vistas, and close up encounters with wildlife. Help ensure your safety and protect the park's wildlife by obeying all speed limits. Obey Road Signs All road signs must be obeyed, such as parking signs and lane markings. Help protect the resource by parking only on hard paved pullouts and not parking on vegetation. Drugs and Alcohol Possession of any controlled substance is prohibited. Operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or other intoxicants, or having open containers of alcohol in a vehicle, is prohibited. Help us protect the park resources and other visitors by identifying a designated driver.  More Information Federal Regulations Certain regulations apply to every national park unit. Those regulations can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations (36 CFR parts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7).
