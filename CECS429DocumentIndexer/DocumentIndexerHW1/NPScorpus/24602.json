The video explains the procedures and rules required of people who drive on the Denali Park Road, beyond Savage River (Mile 15). First-year employees of the National Park Service and holders of Denali Park Road passes must watch the longer version of this video before driving the park road.  Drivers who have been in Denali for more than one summer season must simply watch the abridged, four-minute version of the video each year to refresh themselves on the rules of the road.  Please note that private vehicle traffic is generally restricted at Mile 15; most park visitors will not drive beyond this point, and do not need to watch either of these videos. Visitors are encouraged to sight-see along the park road via one of the many bus services offered.              Rules of Driving the Denali Park Road   Loading the player...
