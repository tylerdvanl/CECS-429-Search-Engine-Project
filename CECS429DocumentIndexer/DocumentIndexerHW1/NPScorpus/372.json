NPS\/Jacobowski   Â    The National Weather Service publishes current weather and forecasts for St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin that are good overviews for the lower St. Croix River. Current weather and forecasts for Trego, Wisconsin are good overviews for the upper St. Croix and Namekagon rivers. Weather Tips  Watch for alerts and stay off the river during high water. Floods not only bring faster currents but floating debris that can be deadly.  Thunderstorms come up quickly and lightning is attracted to water. Get off the river at the first sound of thunder.  Wear sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat to prevent sunburn. Water reflects the rays of the sun, giving you a double dose of ultraviolet light even on cloudy days. Exposure to cool air or cold water can lead to hypothermia. Always pack a spare set of clothes in a dry bag in case you tip.",
