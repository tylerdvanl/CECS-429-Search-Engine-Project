Here, at the Lewis and Clark National and State Historical Parks are preserved the sites that mark the success of key parts of their mission; successfully arriving at the Pacific, making ready for the return trip home, maintaining friendly relations with the homeland tribes and preparing maps and revising journals that would record their discoveries. The sites preserved in these parks allow you to walk where Meriwether Lewis, William Clark and the Corps of Discovery walked. These sites embody the stories of hardship and danger, of surprising collaboration and adaptations, and of exploration and discovery.",
