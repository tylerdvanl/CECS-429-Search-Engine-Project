Under the trial program, Congress authorized four federal land management agencies, the National Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service; to charge fees to visitors. Originally authorized for three years, the program had been extended four times and expired on September 30, 2004. Congress has now extended the program to make it permanent. While eighty percent of the money remains in the park from fees collected by the participating parks, the Director of the National Park Service distributes the remaining twenty percent of the fees collected to special emphasis projects in the parks. Since Channel Islands National Park does not collect any entrance fees, funds for deferred maintenance and visitor service projects comes from this twenty percent. Below are a few examples of how these fees have been spent at Channel Islands National Park:  Rehabilitation of the historic Scorpion Ranch house   Exhibit planning and fabrication for Ventura visitor center   Exhibit planning and fabrication for Santa Cruz Island visitor   Printing of park brochures   Production of new park film   Design and replacement of new audio visual equipment for theater in Ventura visitor center   Design and fabrication of new marine life exhibit in Ventura visitor center     Design and fabrication of new tower exhibits for Ventura visitor center",
