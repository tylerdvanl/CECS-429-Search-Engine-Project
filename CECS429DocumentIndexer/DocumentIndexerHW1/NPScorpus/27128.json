No Idling Policy In an effort to improve visitor enjoyment and reduce environmental impact, Valley Forge has implemented a no idling policy for motor vehicles within the park. All motor vehicles that are parked for more than 30 seconds must turn their engines off. This restriction is to reduce public exposure to diesel, exhaust particulate matter, and other toxic air contaminants by limiting the idling of buses, trucks, and other motor vehicles. In addition, this restriction will limit the noise impact on visitors throughout the park. Learn more about park rules and regulations.
