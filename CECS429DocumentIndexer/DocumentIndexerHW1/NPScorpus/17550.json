    "body": "Fire Management Plan: Operational Strategy - April 2008       The Fire Management Plan (FMP) for Golden Gate National Recreation Area (GGNRA) is an operational manual containing the standards, practices and guidelines in use by the Fire Management Branch of the Law Enforcement Division of GGNRA for conducting actions within the 15,700 acres of primary jurisdiction (see Figure 1 - GGNRA Lands [696 KB PDF]). The legislative boundary of GGNRA is much larger than the area of primary jurisdiction and covers 74,816 acres in Marin, San Francisco and San Mateo counties. The majority of these lands are administered by agencies other than the National Park Service (NPS) such as the California State Department of Park and Recreation, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (San Francisco Watershed Lands), the Presidio Trust, the San Mateo County Division of Parks, and the Marin Municipal Water District. An additional 15,400 acres of GGNRA lands on Bolinas Ridge in Marin County are managed by Point Reyes National Seashore (PRNS) under an agreement between PRNS and GGNRA; this area is covered in the PRNS FMP. For purposes of the FMP, GGNRA will be used to refer to the 15,700 acres directly managed by the NPS through GGNRA and those parcels that will soon pass to the management of GGNRA. The latter category includes Cattle Hill and Pedro Point in the San Mateo County adjacent to the City of Pacifica. The FMP provides a framework for prioritizing, developing and implementing the fire management group's prevention and fuels reduction programs, conducting prescribed burns with resource benefit objectives and advance planning for response to wildland fires within the jurisdictional area. The FMP was built upon guidance provided by the fire management section (Chapter 4, Section 5) of the NPS Management Policies (2006) and the Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy (2001). Federal wildland fire policy stresses the importance of the protection of the lives and safety of firefighters and the public, public and private property, and the protection, restoration and rehabilitation of the natural and cultural resources on federally-managed lands.
