Hanson, a driving force in founding the Friends and its Board of Directors, worked to establish the national lakeshore in the 1960s. He was the personal tour guide of President John F. Kennedy who briefly visited the Apostles as he considered a push by former U.S. Sen. Gaylord Nelson to designate the islands as national parkland.   Friends Mission: To promote an appreciation for and preservation of the cultural and natural heritage and the natural environment of the Apostle Islands. Friends Efforts:  Connect people with the history, beauty, and adventure of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. Increase community involvement with the Islands.

These projects include preservation of historic structures and lighthouses, improved visitor services and facilities, enhanced environmental education programs and more. This effort is meant to complement efforts by the Friends organizations of individual parks. Any private donations received will be split evenly between the parks, unless the donation has a specifically targeted project or park. The NPLSF is actively seeking partners to assist in developing this special new funding organization and invite individual and major donors.
