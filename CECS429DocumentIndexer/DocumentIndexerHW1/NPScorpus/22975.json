Generations of people have journeyed through this area, even before it was a monument. Today, we learn about the people who have lived or traveled across the Tularosa Basin through petroglyphs, artifacts they have left behind, some written accounts, but most interestingly through stories and legends. Part of the fascination that is imparted through legends is the mystery behind them.",
