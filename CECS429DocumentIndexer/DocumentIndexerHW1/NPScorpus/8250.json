    "body": "Adopt-A-Pony       The Ocracoke ponies are some of the island's most beloved residents. The National Park Service has cared for the herd since the early 1960s. But taking care of the Ocracoke herd takes both time and money. An unexpected illness to just one of the ponies can cost hundreds of dollars in veterinarian fees. The fences in the pasture, hay, grain and customary care from the veterinarian and blacksmith are funded in large part by donations. How to donate Thank you for your support of Cape Hatteras National Seashore's Adopt-A-Pony program. Your tax-deductible donation is greatly appreciated and will be used exclusively to care for and protect the Ocracoke pony herd. Donations are used to help with veterinary care, feed and hay, and repairs to the 180-acre pony pasture and facilities. We sincerely hope you find the \"adoptive pony parenting\" to be a rewarding experience and that you will come back and visit your national seashore and Ocracoke ponies often. You can donate in person or by mail. To donate in person, please stop by the Ocracoke Island Visitor Center at  Ocracoke Island Visitor Center 40 Irvin Garrish Road Ocracoke, NC 27960    To donate by mail, please use this address:  Adopt-A-Pony Program PO Box 340 Ocracoke, NC 27960    Donations can be made with cash, check, or credit\/debit card.
