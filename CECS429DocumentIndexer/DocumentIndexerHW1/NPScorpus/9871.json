Â      A guide at the Quincy Mine explains the functions of different workers in the underground.   The former Quincy No. 2 mine shaft with accompanying hoist house is now owned and operated by the Quincy Mine Hoist Association, a Keweenaw Heritage Site. This site interprets the story of the Quincy Mining Company, one of the commercially successful mines in the region. When you visit the Quincy Mine, you can see the world's largest steam hoist, explore the mine's surface area and ruins and ride a cog-wheel tram to a mine adit or side entrance. From there you are taken into the underground for a firsthand view of the mine, the hard work required to mine copper, and the conditions miners faced.",
