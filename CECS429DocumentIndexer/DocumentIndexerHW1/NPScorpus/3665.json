You can become a Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park Junior Ranger. Just download and print the new Junior Ranger book, and bring it with you when you visit the park!   (Our new Junior Ranger book was created by 16-year-old Barrett Young and his parents, Wayne and Dee - all of them NPS Volunteers-In-Parks. Thank you, Young family!) Who is a Junior Ranger? Any young person who is interested in our national parks and who wants to learn more about the natural and historic wonders protected by the National Park Service. Most of the over-400 national parks have a Junior Ranger program; be sure to ask about it whenever you visit one of these amazing places.  Â    If you are a Boy Scout or a Girl Scout, you can also become a National Park Service Scout Ranger. Here's how! The National Park Service also has WebRangers - for kids of all ages. You can learn about our national parks, historic sites, battlefields, plants, animals, and more - on-line - and earn (virtual) badges and medals in the process. Have fun!",
