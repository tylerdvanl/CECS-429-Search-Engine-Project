    "body": "Grant's Headquarters        General Grant intended to march through the Wilderness and attack the Confederates where he assumed they awaited him at Mine Run. However, Robert E. Lee chose to strike Grant's men while they were entangled in the dense undergrowth of the Wilderness. Grant established his headquarters on a slight knoll above the Orange Turnpike, today Route 20.         A short trail leads to the location of Grant's headquarters.         This sketch shows Grant, seated in the center of the image, on the knoll which he used as his command post.         Interpretive exhibits on Grant's Knoll.           Proceed to Wilderness Tavern Site",
