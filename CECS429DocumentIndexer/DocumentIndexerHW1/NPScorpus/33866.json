Skylights and solar-powered security lights reduce energy consumption. Solar heating tubes on the roof power heating coils in the shop floor and reduce the need for extra heating in winter.  Low- flow and waterless restroom facilities reduce water consumption, and the building's steel structure is very easy to recycle and fabricate into new items.
