    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Safety            Safety       Dial 9-1-1 in Emergencies As most of the property within Park boundaries is privately owned, be prepared to give your location. You should report fires, accidents, or life-threatening emergencies. Some areas within the Park or Heritage Sites are considered remote, possibly without cellphone service. You may have to find a nearby land line.    No matter the season, know the current forecast. Summer can bring thunderstorms, while winter snowstorms can make travel or exploration hazardous.        Visitors explore the North Country Trail at Old Victoria.
