Because of the size of this park, we need your support. The park has a volunteer program and a growing Friends of Gulf Islands. People may donate directly to Gulf Islands National Seashore or to Eastern National. Visitors are asked to provide an \"extra eyes and ears\" to help protect the park's resources; help us keep the park clean; and also provide comments concerning projects through the National Park Service PEPC program (Planning Environment and Public Comment).  By supporting our Eastern National bookstore and donation program, the park receives funding to help publish Junior Ranger handbooks; to provide special public events such as Candlelight tours of Fort Barrancas and Earth Day Celebration; and to purchase artifacts for our museum collection.     For more information please call the Chief of Interpretation at 850-934-2618.",
