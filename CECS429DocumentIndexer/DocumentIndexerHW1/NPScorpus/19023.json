Management and Implemention Plans Comprehensive Management and Use Plan (19.4mb pdf file) The Comprehensive Management and Use Plan\/Final Environmental Impact Statement (finalized in 1999) is shaped, in part, by the planning requirements found in section 5(f) of the National Trails System Act (see appendix A). It focuses on the trails’ purpose and significance, resource protection, visitor experience and use, and long-term administrative objectives.  Elements of the proposed plan have been developed in cooperation with federal, state, and local agencies, as well as various nonprofit trail organizations—the entities that form the core of any partnership for national historic trails.  This plan serves as a coordinating document that provides broadbased policies, guidelines, and standards for administering the four trails in such a manner as to ensure the protection of trail resources, their interpretation, and their appropriate public use.  The plan includes not only the Mormon Pioneer NHT, but also the California, Oregon, and the Pony Express trails as well.
