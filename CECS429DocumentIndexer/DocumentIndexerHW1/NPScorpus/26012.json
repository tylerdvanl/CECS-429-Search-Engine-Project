    "body": "Caving Narratives       Caving narratives are short summaries of caving trips into Wind Cave. Most describe exploration trips, but some deal with significant finds or locations, science projects in the cave, or even trips where photography is the main goal of the trip. These trips are organized by the zone in the cave where the caving activity takes place and date. The zones are: Historic, Colorado Grotto, the Lakes and Half-Mile Hall Zones (which includes the Club Room Area), North Zone, Silent Expressway and Southern Comfort Zones.  Clicking on the link will take you to the zones listed. The section at the end of the list are the significant finds or locations that led to new discoveries or a better understanding of the cave. Many of these involve several trips to an area.        Historic Zone is in Yellow       Zone   Date     Historic    July 12, 1984 July 22, 1984 July 20, 1985 September 18, 1985 September 26, 1985 October 30-31, 1985 November 21, 1985 April 22, 1986 April 29, 1986 May 13, 1986 November 29, 1986 December 30, 1986 January 1, 1987 March 18, 1987 March 19, 1987 March 21, 1987 May 25, 1987 July 16, 1987 August 9, 1987 November 20, 1987 December 6, 1987 December 16, 1987 December 20, 1987 December 21, 1987 March 7, 1988 April 28, 1988 May 4, 1988 September 21, 1999 November 27, 1999 December 11, 1999 January 12, 2000 January 29, 2000 February 21, 2000 March 14, 2000 March 25, 2000 November 11, 2000 February 10, 2001 March 15, 2001 May 29, 2001 June 25, 2001 August 2, 2001 August 11, 2001 August 16, 2001 February 21, 2002 other trips listed on this page:   March 5, 2002 May 7, 2002 July 18, 2002 Jan 10, 2003 Jan 25, 2003 July 16, 2003 February 14, 2004 March 17, 2004 April 7, 2004 January 13, 2007 February 10, 2007   March 13, 2002 August 5, 2002 January 29, 2003  February 22, 2003 April 13, 2003 June 20, 2003 January 8, 2005 May 3, 2005 January 25. 2006 February 11, 2006 April 8, 2006 June 6, 2006 October 3, 2006 October 14, 2006 October 31, 2006 April 14, 2007 May 26, 2007 June 5, 2007 July 10, 2007 July 29, 2007 July 13, 2007 August 7, 2007 August 15,2007 August 25, 2007 September 08, 2007 September 22, 2007 October 02, 2007 December 8, 2007 December 22, 2007 January 12, 2008 February 9, 2008 July 13, 2008 August 8, 2009 February 27, 2010 January 10, 2011 December 3, 2011 January 14, 2012 February 10, 2012 February 17 and 18, 2012 March 6, 2012 March 13, 2012 November 11, 2012             Colorado Grotto Zone is in yellow           Colorado Grotto    May 21, 1984 May 27, 1984 June 3, 1984 June 11, 1984 May 27, 1985 June 12, 1985 March 10, 1986 July 14, 1986 December 5, 1998 April 3, 1999 Janurary 23, 1999 April 17, 1999 April 25, 1999 July 19, 1999 September 11, 1999 August 11, 2000 September 2, 2000 October 14, 2000 August 11, 2001 April 13, 2002 December 3, 2010              Lakes Zone (left) & Half-Mile Hall Zone (right) are in yellow           Half-Mile Hall    November 2, 1987 November 18, 1987 December 9, 1987 November 16, 1988 November 30, 1988 February 3, 1989 February 17, 1989 July 17, 1989 September 3, 1989 December 5, 1998 April 3, 1999 March 4, 2000 May 29, 2000 September 2, 2000 November 11, 2000 January 13, 2001 April 14, 2001 August 11, 2001 January 8, 2005 April 9, 2005 May 2, 2005 February 11, 2006 January 12, 2008 February 9, 2008      Lakes Zone    October 16, 1985 September 22, 1986 October 22, 1986 October 27, 1986 November 3, 1986 December 2, 1986 December 8, 1986 May 6, 1987 May 12, 1987 November 25, 1987 January 21 & March 3, 1988 January 18, 1989 July 19 & November 18, 1989 October 9,1999 December 3, 2007              North Zone is in yellow           North    April 29, 1986 May 13, 1986 August 11, 1986 November 18, 1986 June 12, 1987 August 7, 1987 August 27, 1987 July 31, 1988 July 28,1990 July 14, 2001 May 11, 2002 July 13, 2002 January 8, 2005 February 11, 2006 September 4, 2007 August 5, 2008  September 2, 2008               Silent Expressway Zone and Southern Comfort Zone are in yellow           Silent Expressway    July 23, 1987 December 12, 1987 January 8, 2000      Southern Comfort    1997 November 9, 2002 January 11, 2003 December 11, 2004 February 11, 2006 March 24, 2007 June 13, 2008  January 23 - 26, 2009 January 29, 2012                        Significant Finds     100 Milestone   Alpine Way Survey   Alvin McDonald Signature & High Hopes Discovery   Alvin McDonald Signature & Shirk Street   Ballot Box Discovery   Button Popcorn Discovery   Camp Cosmos 1st trip   Chertstone Connection Discovery   Crinoid Discovery   Crumble Lane Discovery   Dreamscape Discovery   Dynamite Discovery   Fissure Kingdom Discovery   Flatlands Discovery   Flour Box North Discovery   Fourteeners Discovery   Gas Chamber Discovery   Ghost Town Discovery   Hades Discovery   Helictites Discovery   Historic Specimen Label   Hobsons Bypass Discovery   Hoo-Pnew Discovery   Horn Coral Discovery   Iron Oxide Needles   Knee Bone Room Discovery   Lake Vega Discovery    Lakes Dye Tracing Project   Loose Cannon Run Discovery   Lost Fissure Rediscovery   Mind Boggler Discovery   Mock October Room Discovery   Paleo Entrance Discovery   Paleo Flood Debris   Phantom Lake Discovery   Pink Residue Discovery   Pizza Hut Discovery   Rio Colorado Discovery   Rite of Spring Discovery   Rope Climbing Leads   Seismic Hall Discovery   Stalactite Galore Discovery   Stargazer Hall Discovery   Stream Cobble Study   Task Master Room Discovery   Terra Cotta Trail Discovery   Ton 80 Room Discovery   Two-foot Long Fossil Burrow Discovery   Waterfall Discovery   Wind Becomes 5th Longest Cave in World   Wind Becomes 4th Longest Cave in World   Woodrat Skeleton Discovery   Yahoo Discovery   Zebra Rock Discovery",
