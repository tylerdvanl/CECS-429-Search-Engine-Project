Many of the properties included in the park are located in areas that are still part of active DOE mission. Because of safety and security issues some facilities may not be immediately open to the public and others may only be visited on organized bus tours. The National Park Service and the Department of Energy are working together to safely expand access to the facilities included in the park.",
