    "body": "Field Trips      Take your students for an adventure on the beach with a field trip to Padre Island National Seashore! Field trips should be scheduled at least two weeks in advance. Staff availability for programs is limited, and some dates get reserved several months in advance, so contact us early. Educational groups can request fee waivers that provide free entrance into the park. Through a partnership with Shark-a-thon, we also offer a limited number of transportation grants each year to help eligible schools cover the cost of transportation to the park. And all programs for school and other educational groups are offered free of charge.   To schedule a field trip or for more information, contact our Education Specialist at (361) 949-8068.   You will need to provide: 路  A point of contact (usually the leader of the group coming to the park) 路  The number of students who will participate 路  The age range \/ grade level of the students 路  Information on any special needs (e.g. wheelchairs, etc.) of any participants",
