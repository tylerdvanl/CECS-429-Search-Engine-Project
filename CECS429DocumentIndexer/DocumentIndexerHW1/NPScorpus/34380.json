    "body": "Stories       The Oxford English Dictionary defines history as \"a narrative of past events, account, tale or story\".  Over the years, Historic Jamestowne staff members have researched and written dozens of short papers on various historical themes.  Whether biographies of well-known Jamestown personalities, explanations of early industries or a time-line related to a site-specific topic, these fact sheets are your portal to Jamestown's past. The park rangers of Colonial NHP hope you find these short papers useful and welcome suggestions for other topics to include in this section.",
