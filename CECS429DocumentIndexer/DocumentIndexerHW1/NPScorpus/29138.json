    "body": "Hiking Regulations       For an enjoyable, safe hike and for the protection of park resources, please observe a number of common-sense rules:  Although hiking by yourself is enjoyable, hiking with two is always safer and more fun! Children should not be allowed to hike without adult supervision. Dogs are prohibited on all the trails leading into the Environmental Study Area (east of the Travertine Nature Center). On other trails, pets must be leased at all times. Please be considerate of other hikers and clean up after your pet. Observe all posted restrictions, such as no bikes on certain sections of the trails. Bikers should yield to hikers and use caution in areas where vision is restricted, such as around curves. Be a friend to the park and help us keep the park clean. Please pick up your litter and anyone else's left behind. Carry out all litter - film wrappers, soda cans, drink cups, tissue paper, etc. If you must smoke, please extinguish your cigarette butts safely, and do not leave them behind. Stay on the designated trails; short cuts cause damage to precious park resources. If you hike at night, use a flashlight to illuminate the trail and to watch for animals such as snakes and scorpions. Poison Ivy and ticks are common in the park. Check yourself thoroughly for ticks after walking on the trails. Dress appropriately for seasonal weather conditions, and bring plenty of water to drink. During the summer months drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration. All plants, animals, and natural and historical resources are protected by federal law. Do not disturb or remove them. For specific regulations, such as fishing, camping, fires, or other questions please stop by any Ranger Station.  PLEASE TAKE ONLY PICTURES...AND LEAVE ONLY FOOTPRINTS.",
