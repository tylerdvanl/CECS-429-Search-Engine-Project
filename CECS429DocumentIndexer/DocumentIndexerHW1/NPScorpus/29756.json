The federal agencies most represented on Ellis Island were the military, predominately the United States Coast Guard, and, during the two World Wars, the United States Army. Items belonging to the employees, the hat and uniform worn by a member of the Coast Guard Women's Reserve (SPARs), and photographs of the medical personnel serving the military in the island's hospitals are evidence of this use and a significant component of the museum collection.       World War I soldiers posed in front of the hospital complex c. 1918 National Park Service, Statue of Liberty NM       < History of Ellis Island from 1892 to 1954 | Back to Museum Collection | From Immigration Station to Museum >",
