Those portions of the Pony Express National Historic Trail authorized by Congress include nearly 2,000 miles of historic trail. The route passes through eight states from Missouri to California.  Auto Tour Route driving directions take visitors along modern highways that approximate or closely parallel the historic route taken by Pony Express riders in 1860 and 1861. The Places to Go page provides useful contact information for local land and\/or site managing agencies and organizations along the route.  State by state Auto Tour Route (ATR) Interpretive Guides provide an interpretive history of the trail through each state along with directions to sites where trail related interpretive media and\/or educational programs may be found. As they are developed, the Interpretive Guides will be available at trail related sites, state Welcome Centers, and museums in each state. Electronic copies of these Auto Tour Route Interpretive Guides are also available on the website to download to your computer as Acrobat Reader PDF documents.",
