This non-profit organization continues to serve as a supporting arm of Charles Pinckney National Historic Site and the National Park Serviceâ€™s efforts to preserve, protect and enhance the park for the benefit and education of the public.  In 1986, shortly after the property was sold to developers, private citizens organized The Friends of Historic Snee Farm, a 501c.3 non-profit group, to protect the last remnant of Charles Pinckney's original Snee Farm. This community-based organization succeeded in securing congressional action to preserve the site. The National Park Service established Charles Pinckney National Historic Site on September 8, 1988. With significant financial assistance from the Friends, the NPS purchased the 28-acre site in 1990. The Friends have continued to provide input on broad management issues and assisted with special fund raising to enhance preservation and education efforts in the park.",
