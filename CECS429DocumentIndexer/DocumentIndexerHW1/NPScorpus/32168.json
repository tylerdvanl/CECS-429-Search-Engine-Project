The lives of frogs, toads, and salamanders, like the ones found within the park, are tied to water, so many can be found near streams or hidden under damp leaf litter. Because they are very sensitive to changes in their environment, the salamanders here in the park are part of a research study that looks to better understand how environmental changes effect salamander populations. The park's resource managers place boards out over a test area that the salamanders burrow under; the resource managers can then simply lift the boards and count the salamanders to get an idea of the size and health of the overall population. Often school groups are able to assist with this project. The park hopes that through this research, we can better help and protect salamander populations.         Link to the Park's multimedia page to view a student salamander monitoring video.       Amphibians in Winter  Mammals are not the only animals to use hibernation as a way to survive winter. Amphibians, like frogs and salamanders, have evolved with some very unique ways of surviving the cold. Many amphibians will spend the time underwater or, like salamanders, go deep underground in tunnels made by small mammals. Wood frogs and the spring peepers will often spend their winters in deep cracks in logs and rocks or the might bury themselves as far as they can in leaf litter to avoid the frosts. Unfortunately, sometimes even these protected places can freeze, but yet the amphibian doesn't die. This is because of special chemicals in their bodies similar to anti-freeze that allows them to survive nearly frozen during the winter. While their hearts have stopped beating and they are not breathing, these frogs will thaw out when spring arrives, and continue on with their lives, as good as new.",
