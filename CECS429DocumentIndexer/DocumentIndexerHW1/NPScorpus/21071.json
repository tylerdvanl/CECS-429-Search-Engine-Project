In 2003, North Little Rock’s Riverside Park, on the north bank of the Arkansas River, became a certified site on the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail. The City of North Little Rock, the Arkansas Historic Preservation Program, and other groups felt the need to document the Indian Removal story and to provide historic context, so a cost share agreement was worked out between the NPS and the University of Arkansas Little Rock (UALR). Subsequently, Professor Dan Littlefield of UALR and a two-member research team developed the following historic context report. It provided interpreters and park developers with key Removal-related information about North Little Rock and the surrounding area.
