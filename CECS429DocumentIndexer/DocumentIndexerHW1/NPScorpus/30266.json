NPS Photo  Museum  Once visitors finish watching the orientation film, they are encouraged to explore the park museum.  It offers a small glimpse into the life of the people of the Hopewell culture.  Artifacts recovered during the last major excavation in the mid-1920's are on display in cases located throughout the museum.  Beautiful pieces of copper, pipestone and shells were worked into effigy objects and then used for mortuary ceremonies or worn as adornments during ceremonies or everyday life.  The museum also offers an interactive kiosk which allows visitors to explore the many sites of the Hopewell located throughout Ross County.        A park ranger provides visitors a patio talk at the visitor center. NPS Photo  Patio and Trails The outside of the building offers a large viewing patio and walking trails to explore the Mound City Group.  The patio is where many of the Guided Tours begin and also has benches for guests to sit down and take in the gorgeous view of the mounds.  Walking down the concrete path from the visitor center, guests will find a path to the nature trail which meanders through the forest on the north side of the earthwork complex.  Visitors can also enter the earthworks enclosure to access the informative waysides or they can take the trail that goes around the southern perimeter of the earthwork enclosure.  All three options lead to the river trails on the east side of the park which overlook the Scioto River.        Eastern National was founded by NPS rangers in 1947 at Gettysburg National Military Park.
