Exhibits Many of the objects, quotes, and information in the center came directly from Aleutian residents and World War II veterans who have shepherded this project along from the beginning. Exhibits on the Aleutian Campaign and the evacuation and internment of the Unangan (Aleut) people are on display on the lower level of the Aerology Building. The radio room uptairs in the has been reconstructed from 1940s photographs to look as it did during World War II. The Visitor Center regularly shows World War II-era films in its 1940s-style theatre, including \"Report from the Aleutians\" and \"Alaska at War.\"  Available Facilities The Aerology Building is one of the most intact and architecturally significant World War II buildings in the Aleutian Islands. During the war years, the building served as the central station from which to monitor the unpredictable and harsh weather of Aleutians. World War II pilots relied on the data gathered at the station to complete air missions to and from Dutch Harbor.",
