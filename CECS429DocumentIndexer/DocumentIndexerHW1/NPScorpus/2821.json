The Las Vegas Bearpoppy's habitat is found in the harshest and driest soils in the Mojave Desert, where few other plants survive. They especially favor soils with a high gypsum content. The plants consist of one or more clusters of basal rosette leaves with a generally light blue or grey appearance. The leaves are generally wedge-shaped, with the end of each divided into several teeth and entirely covered with long hairs 5-15 mm in length, looking like a little bear paw.      Range Map                    Photo Gallery                     Las Vegas Bearpoppy   3 Photos  Photos of the Las Vegas Bearpoppy                        References       Encyclopedia of Life Wikipedia    Back to Top",
