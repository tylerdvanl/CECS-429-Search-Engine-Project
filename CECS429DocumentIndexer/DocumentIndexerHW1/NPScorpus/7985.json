At over 5,000 feet elevation, harsh weather often invades these exposed ridges, resulting in the gnarled forests of beech, birch, and buckeye. These summits are home to the most spectacular rhododendron displays along the Parkway corridor. For generations, visitors have headed up to the Craggies in mid to late June to view the pink and purple blooms. A popular picnicking spot, the Craggies is an especially good place for stargazing. Mount Mitchell State Park, the highest mountain east of the Mississippi, is close by.   Â    What to Do   Plan your adventure at the Craggy Gardens visitor center Take a short hike up Craggy Pinnacle trail and witness a stunning 360-view of seemingly endless peaks and forested slopes Enjoy a picnic amid natural beauty Visit nearby Mount Mitchell, the highest point east of the Mississippi",
