    "body": "Webcams            As the gently undulating prairie breaks into the bewildering, jagged badlands terrain, the view from this overlook has inspired, amazed, and terrified travelers from the past to the present. Painted Canyon is the first glimpse visitors receive of the Badlands while traveling west on I-94.   The view from the webcam outside Painted Canyon Visitor Center looks north into the park. Buck Hill, in the center of the image, is the second-highest point in the South Unit. The hill is just under 2.5 miles from the camera. On a clear day, the Badlands stretch on endlessly into the horizon.   This webcam is part of a National Park Service air quality website that has live air quality from Theodore Roosevelt National Park, as well as other national parks.",
