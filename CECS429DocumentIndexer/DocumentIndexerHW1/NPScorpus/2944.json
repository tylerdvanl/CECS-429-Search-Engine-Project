And more are being added all the time. The collection is as varied as the park itself, containing fossils, ancient pottery, photographs, paintings, plant and animal specimens, superintendents' notes, stone tools, furniture, and much more. The objects are preserved and protected within special containers and cabinets, and taken care of by a professional curator. Some items are put out for display. In a park that celebrates its active research, the curator is kept very busy.   Every park site has a collection, making the National Park Service a huge repository of items important to the cultural and natural history of the country. You can virtually explore the NPS Museum Collections.                   Museum Collections Gallery   14 Photos  Curious to know what Petrified Forest keeps stored in its Collections?
