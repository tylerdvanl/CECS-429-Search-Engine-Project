    "body": "Explore This Park    Learn About the Park     History & Culture     Collections               Collections       With the many significant historic events taking place at Harpers Ferry over the past centuries, people keep mementos, write about their experiences, as well as commemorate these historic events. While the park Museum Program collects, preserves, and exhibits a sampling of these items, there are many objects in private hands that could fill gaps within our collections.    While we cherish and value all historic objects, due to space constraints the park has firm collection guidelines as set forth in the Scope of Collections Statement. In general, we collect objects and archives related to John Brown's raid, the Civil War, Industrial Technology, Transportation, and African-American History. If you have something you believe might be of interest to the park, please complete the Donor Questionnaire and either print it out and mail it or attach it to an email to the addresses provided at the top of the form. It is important to our review process that you include photographs of all sides of the item(s) you wish to donate and any identifying marks. Also include the dimensions of the items as part of this submission. We cannot accept all items offered and have a committee of senior park staff to assist with making these decisions. If it is determined that your items do not fit our Scope of Collections Statement, we will attempt to provide information on other museums that may be a more appropriate repository for your donation.   Research Guidelines Due to staffing constraints we ask that you contact park staff a minimum of 30 days in advance using the Researcher Registration form.
