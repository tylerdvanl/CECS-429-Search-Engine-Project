We are funded by Federal tax dollars and take seriously our obligations to the American public. The Superintendent's Compendium provides specific park regulations for Manzanar National Historic Site.  As of February 22, 2010, a new federal law allows people who can legally possess firearms under applicable federal, state, and local laws, to legally possess firearms in this park.  It is the responsibility of visitors to understand and comply with all applicable state, local, and federal firearms laws before entering this park. As a starting point, please visit our stateâ€™s website: http:\/\/ag.ca.gov\/firearms\/  Federal law also prohibits firearms in certain facilities in this park; those places are marked with signs at all public entrances. At Manzanar National Historic Site, firearms are prohibited in the Visitor Center\/Park Headquarters, also known as the historic auditorium. The enabling legislation is the wording that Congress chose when designating Manzanar as a National Historic Site. Our General Management Plan is the document that guides what we do and how we spend our money. It is the result of years of dialogue between an appointed Advisory Commission, elected officials and many individuals and groups representing our constituent communities.",
