Many of our facilities are historic, and accessibility is not always ideal. However, we are always working to improve accessibility.  We have established a parkwide Accessibility Coordinator.     Your comments on accessibility areas for improvement are always appreciated.  Please feel free to email us!            Braille Brochures The National Mall and Memorial Parks provide braille brochures of each of the memorials free of charge to onsite visitors.  If possible, please feel free to email us or call 202-426-6841 to provide advance notice of your visit or visit the Survey Lodge Ranger Station to pick up copies upon your arrival. Brochures available include the Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Martin Luther King, Jr., Vietnam Veterans, and Korean War Veterans Memorials and the Washington Monument.         Closed Captioning Closed captioning is available for the films in the Lincoln Memorial, Thomas Jefferson Memorial and the Washington Monument.
