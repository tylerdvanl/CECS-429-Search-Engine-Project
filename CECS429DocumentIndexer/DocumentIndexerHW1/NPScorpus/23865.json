    "body": "Explore This Park    Learn About the Park     Management             Management       Petroglyph National Monument was authorized by Congress on June 27, 1990 to protect petroglyphs and other significant natural and cultural resources, and to facilitate research activities associated with the resources. Read the official Enabling Legislation here. Like each of its sister national parks, Petroglyph must balance the competing demands of its dual mission: providing for a fulfilling visitor experience and protecting the significant resources located here. For more information read the Superintendent's Compendium.        First Amendment Activities Freedom of speech, press, religion and assembly are constitutional rights. However, the courts have recognized that activities associated with the exercise of these rights may be reasonably regulated to protect park resources. The necessity of a permit to conduct First Amendment activities is determined by the group size, either a \"small group\" or a \"large group.\" This guidance affects only the Federally managed Atrisco Unit of Petroglyph National Monument. A \"small group\" is defined as 25 people or less. A small group is not required to obtain a First Amendment Permit if they are located within a park designated First Amendment site and have no more than leaflets, booklets, and\/or hand held signs. A permit is required for any \"small group\" that:  a. wants to hold a demonstration or distribute and\/or sell printed materials somewhere outside a designated First Amendment site. b. is merely an extension of another \"small group\" already exceeding the 25 person maximum. c. wants to guarantee they will have priority for the use of a location, including the designated First Amendment site.  d. wants to use a sound system, tables, banners or platforms, etc. A \"large group\" is defined as more than 25 people and is required to obtain a First Amendment Permit even if they are utilizing a park designated First Amendment site. Some examples of events that fall under the First Amendment Rules:  · Distribution and\/or sales of printed materials or publications · Religious services · Public demonstrations or assemblies First Amendment activities that require a permit are restricted to the current First Amendment site which is the Lava Shadows Access Road (see attached map), south of the Visitor Center Parking Lot. There are no permit fees associated with First Amendment permits.
