    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Weather              Weather       Devils Postpile National Monument is located at 7,560 feet above sea level just west of the Sierra Nevada crest.  As such, it experiences typical Sierran summer weather.  Afternoon thunderstorms are possible in July and August. Daytime temperatures can range from the mid-70s to to mid-80s (degrees fahrenheit).  Evening temperatures can drop into the low 40s (and even the low 30s in the months of September and October).       In the fall of 2005, Scripps Institute of Oceanography, California Department of Water Resources, and the National Park Service cooperatively worked to install a new meteorologic (met) station in Soda Springs Meadow.  The station will provide important data for climate research and the management of California's water resources. NPS Photo       SODA SPRINGS METEOROLOGICAL STATION  The meteorologic (met) station measures ambient air temperature, barometric pressure, relative humidity, surface radiation, wind speed, wind direction, and precipitation. In addition, it is equipped with snow pillows- instruments that can detect the amount of water content in the snow pack.  Data from the Soda Springs weather station is uploaded daily and can be viewed year-round in graph format by visiting Scripps' website. For more weather information, visit the California Department of Water Resources Website for Devils Postpile. This will lead you to daily readings from the monument's meteorological station.",
