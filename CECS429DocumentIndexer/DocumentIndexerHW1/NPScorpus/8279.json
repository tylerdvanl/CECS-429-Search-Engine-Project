    "body": "Places       Along the over 70 miles of the nationâ€™s first national seashore from Nags Head to Ocracoke are fishing villages, historic structures, and tiny cemeteries that have helped shape the unique history and culture of the area. Visitors and locals alike often find their favorite places here, even if it is simply a spot on the beach where the pounding surf, the cry of the gulls and the whipping wind conjure up images of a past that has made the seashore and its places what they are today.",
