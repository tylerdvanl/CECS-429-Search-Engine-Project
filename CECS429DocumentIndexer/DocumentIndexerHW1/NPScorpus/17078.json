High clearance and a four-wheel-drive vehicle is generally recommended. Adjacent to the vast Mojave National Preserve, Castle Mountains provides opportunities to experience quiet and solitude away from metropolitan areas.  Using GPS Navigation GPS Navigation in remote locations like Castle Mountain is notoriously unreliable. GPS maps aren't always up to date and sometimes lead travelers onto primitive or four-wheel-drive roads that they are unprepared for. Travelers should always carry up-to-date road maps to check the accuracy of GPS directions. Use common sense before heading down a primitive dirt road in the desert.  Do not depend only on your vehicle or other GPS navigation system.",
