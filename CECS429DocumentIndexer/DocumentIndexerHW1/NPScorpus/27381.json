The importance of these nationally significant places is that they offer both a window into how the Cold War was lived and fought while also connecting visitors with the deeper meanings inherent in the historic resources. These places symbolize more than their tangible worth by revealing universal human values as freedom, democracy, security, sacrifice and vigilance. They also symbolize darker concepts of fear and destruction.  The park's curatorial staff catalog and study items left behind—everything from a giant blast door to matchbooks with logos from Strategic Air Command to the food menu posted on a kitchen wall –these help provide information about missile culture, work or leisure patterns and military organizations among other things. Over the past decade Minuteman Missile's curatorial staff documented thousands of artifacts that have become part of the permanent museum collection. They have also completed reports on Cultural Landscapes and Historic Structures which provide direction for future treatment of facilities and the care of museum artifacts. For questions about preservation of the two distinct sites that are Minuteman Missile National Historic Site please e-mail the park's curator Megan Cherry or e-mail us.",
