The NPS engages in planning to ensure our decisions are as effective and efficient as possible in carrying out the NPS mission to preserve unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the NPS for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations.  The National Environmental Policy Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, the Wilderness Act, and other laws and regulations and NPS policies require that certain procedural steps be taken, and that park staff analyze all plans and project proposals to determine the degree of impacts on the environment. The involvement and input of the interested and affected public is an essential component in this process.
