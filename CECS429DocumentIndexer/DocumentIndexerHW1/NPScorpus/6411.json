    "body": "Share Your Homesteading Story       Living Homesteader Project  The goal of the Living Homesteader Project at Homestead National Monument of America is to locate and record the experiences of many of the remaining homesteaders before the opportunity is lost. We are looking for people who filed claims under the Homestead Act of 1862; both the successful and unsuccessful homesteaders. Another goal is to bring together and coordinate a group of historians from across the United States to capture the knowledge and experiences held by living homesteaders. The scholars will determine what vital information is needed from these living homesteaders and design oral history questionnaires. Oral histories will be taken under the direction of one or more of these scholars with the assistance of college graduate history students from the University of Nebraska and Grand Valley State University, Michigan. One important outcome from this information will be the launching of scholarly writings based on the scholar's area of study and information obtained from the living homesteaders. If you are a homesteader or a descendant, please help us by sending your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address to: Friends of Homestead Homestead National Monument of America 8523 W.
