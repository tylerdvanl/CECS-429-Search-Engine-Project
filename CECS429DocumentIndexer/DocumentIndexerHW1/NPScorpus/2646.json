The park is an ideal \"outdoor classroom\" in which to explore the Sinagua culture and appreciate the value of pre-historic preservation. Think of your National Parks as off-site classrooms! There are many ways to utilize America's treasures as teaching tools. After all, we have \"the real thing,\" and we love to work with you to teach students the importance of the special places we all work together to preserve and protect for future generations. Elementary schools are not the only groups who can visit Montezuma Castle National Monument. We welcome everyone from preschoolers through senior citizens. Reservations for special ranger-led education programs are required, as we may already have other groups scheduled for that day.",
