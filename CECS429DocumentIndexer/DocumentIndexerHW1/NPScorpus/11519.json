Climate 365 is a yearlong effort in 2013 to highlight NASA's ongoing monitoring of Earth's climate. Research at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) emphasizes a broad study of global change, which is an interdisciplinary initiative addressing natural and man-made changes in our environment that occur on various time scales—from one-time forcings such as volcanic explosions, to seasonal and annual effects such as El Niño, and on up to the millennia of ice ages—and that affect the habitability of our planet.  Top of Page           National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration  Climate.gov is a source of timely and authoritative scientific data and information about climate. Climate.gov's goals are to promote public understanding of climate science and climate-related events, to make NOAA data products and services easy to access and use, to provide climate-related support to the private sector and the Nation's economy, and to serve people making climate-related decisions with tools and resources that help them answer specific questions. The U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit provides scientific tools, information, and expertise to help people manage their climate-related risks and opportunities, and improve their resilience to extreme events. The site is designed to serve interested citizens, communities, businesses, resource managers, planners, and policy leaders at all levels of government.              Pacific Institute  Climate Change and Water Climate Change Vulnerability and Resilience Report: The Impacts of Sea-Level Rise on the California Coast - March 2009 Sea-Level Rise Maps            RealClimate - a commentary site on climate science by working climate scientists for the interested public and journalists.          The Rocky Mountain Climate Organization and Natural Resources Defense Council  Losing Ground: Western National Parks Endangered by Climate Disruption - July 2006 (1.84 MB PDF)  Top of Page            The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission  San Francisco Bay Scenarios for Sea Level Rise Index Map             Skeptical Science - Explaining climate change science & rebutting global warming misinformation.            Union of Concerned Scientists  Explore the Climate Hot Map to see evidence of climate change including heat waves, sea-level rise, flooding, melting glaciers, earlier spring arrival, coral reef bleaching, and the spread of disease.
