The schedule is variable, so check our calendar or Facebook page, or call us at (907) 442-3890 to see if we have an up-coming event. Whether you’re returning from a two-week float trip down the Kobuk River, just visiting Kotzebue for a day or a life-long resident, we have something that will interest you.
