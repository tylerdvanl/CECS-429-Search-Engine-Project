Why do national parks exist? Why is this ground special enough to save? How can I help to save it, too? Can't everyone be a Ranger in his or her own way? Become a Junior Ranger at Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania NMP! Our park has four booklets of activities available for kids. After completing each booklet, Junior Rangers receive a patch to mark their accomplishment. Earn all four \"rocker\" patches to complete your set! Our booklets are free and highlight each major battlefield in the park. Pick them up on-site (ask at the information desk) or download below. After taking the Junior Ranger booklet with you to explore the battlefield, fill out the required sections with your best answers, and turn it in to the staff at the visitor center front desk. A ranger or volunteer will review your answers, then award you a Junior Ranger patch if you have met all of the necessary requirements. Good luck!         Fredericksburg Battlefield Junior Ranger Pick up your booklet at the Fredericksburg Battlefield Visitor Center!
