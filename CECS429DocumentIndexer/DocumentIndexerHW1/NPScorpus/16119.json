    "body": "Field Trips         Fort Scott offers two formal curriculum based education programs: Life on the Frontier for grades K-4 and Sweep through History for grades 4-8, These programs are offered on specified dates in April and May. (See info below for specific dates and to make reservations for 2015.)  Groups in grades 4-8 who are unable to attend on these dates but still want a similar educational experience can still choose from one or more of the stations on our Conflict on the Border page. Groups in K-4 who are unable to come to Life on the Frontier could still choose from one or more of the stations listed on our Virtual Resource Center. The difference is that at other times of year (due to staffing levels), the site will not be able to accomodate as many stations at one time. School groups may also elect to take a guided tour of the fort or to participate in a self guided activity. Regardless of what activity your class participates in, you will still benefit from general information about planning an onsite visits, which can be accessed by following the links in the left hand menu under Planning a Field Trip.
