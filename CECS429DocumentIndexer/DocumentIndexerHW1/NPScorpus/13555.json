The Old Stone House, one of the oldest known structures remaining in the nation's capital, is a simple 18th century dwelling built and inhabited by common people.         Peirce Mill Tilden Drive, NW (at Beach Drive) Washington, DC Peirce Mill was built in the 1820's, and operated commercially until 1897. The United States Government acquired the mill as part of Rock Creek Park in 1892. Currently the mill is not operating. It is being preserved and ultimately will be made operable again when sufficient funding for repairs is made available. Peirce Mill is on the National Register of Historic Places.         Meridian Hill Park 16th and W St., NW Washington, DC Meridian Hill Park is located in northwest Washington, D.C. and is bordered by 16th, Euclid, 15th, and W Streets. Construction of the park was begun in 1914, but it was not until 1936 that Meridian Hill reached the full status of a formal park. In 1933 the grounds were transferred to the National Park Service. Meridian Hill Park was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1994, as \"an outstanding accomplishment of early 20th-century Neoclassicist park design in the United States\"        Dumbarton Oaks Park stone bridge NPS Photo  Dumbarton Oaks Park R Street and Lovers Lane Washington, DC Dumbarton Oaks Park is an exceptionally significant historic landscape, where the naturalistic gardens and built features offer a very special experience to those who visit. The park is a striking example of one of the most important designs by landscape architect Beatrix Farrand. Mrs. Farrand is considered the \"finest woman landscape architect of her generation.\" The owners of the Dumbarton Oaks estate, Mildred and Robert Woods Bliss, wanted Mrs. Farrand to create for them an illusion of country life within the city. And, working closely with Mildred Bliss, Mrs. Farrand made the vision a reality.          Montrose Park NPS Photo  Montrose Park 32nd and R Streets, NW Washington, DC  Montrose Park occupies land that belonged to rope-making magnate Robert Parrott during the early 19th century. Parrott generously allowed Georgetown residents to use his tract of land for picnics and meetings. The area became known as Parrott's Woods and by the early 20th century it had fallen into disrepair. Sarah Louisa Rittenhouse spearheaded a group of women who petitioned Congress to buy the acreage and establish Montrose Park \"for the recreation and pleasure of the people.\"          Georgetown Waterfront Park   Georgetown Waterfront Park Wisconsin and K Streets, NW Washington, DC The Georgetown Waterfront Park provides a green space for visitor recreation and contemplation. Cyclists, skaters, and pedestrians have their own car-free pathways with views of individual boaters, kayakers and competitive crews as well as of Roosevelt Island and the magnificent Key Bridge. The park curves along 10 acres of the Potomac extending from the Washington Harbor complex to Key Bridge, creating the vital last link in 225 miles of parkland from Mt. Vernon, Virginia, to Cumberland, Maryland.",
