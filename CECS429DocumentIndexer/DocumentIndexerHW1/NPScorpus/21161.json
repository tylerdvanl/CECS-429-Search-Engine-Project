    "body": "Visitor Etiquette          On August 25, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson signed the \"Organic Act\" establishing the National Park Service \"...which purpose is to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\" Providing for the enjoyment while also preserving and protecting The Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail and the Lowndes Interpretive Center (LIC) is a delicate balance. You can help us accomplish this balance by following a few simple DO's and DON'T's. Teachers and chaperons should be aware of these rules and remind their students of what constitutes appropriate behavior within the LIC. These rules will help make your visit safer and more enjoyable, as well as protecting this hallowed site. The park staff thanks you in advance for your cooperation. Remember, you and your students are the ambassadors of your school.  PLEASE FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE RULES:  DO: Enjoy your visit, tour the Lowndes Interpretive Center and Selma Interpretive Center at your own pace. Please walk only on the pathways outside of the buildings.  DON'T: Run through the buildings, stray from the pathways, write on the walls, or run rapid around the designated parking areas.  DO: Remember that other visitors are trying to enjoy the Lowndes Interpretive Center, museum, exhibits and book shop. The Interpretive Centers should be treated like a library (noise should be kept to a minimum).  DON'T: Allow your students to carry-on loud conversations within the Interpretive Centers exhibits, theaters or book store un-chaperoned.  DO: Enjoy a picnic lunch on grounds at the appropriate locations. Picnicking is permitted at the picnic tables located around the grounds. PLEASE take your trash with you when finished eating and remember that dogs must be kept on a leash at all times.  DON'T: Picnic in the Interpretive Centers and please don't leave litter outside.  DO: Enjoy watching the wildlife and observing the many natural resources and enchanting scenery. Remember the National Park Service is tasked to protect and preserve the wildlife and scenery. DON'T: Pick the flowers or plants, remove any object from the trail; harass, taunt, chase or throw rocks at the wildlife or fellow visitors.",
