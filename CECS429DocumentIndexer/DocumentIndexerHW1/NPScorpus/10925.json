Entrance Passes:   Annual Passes - $0.00 At this time, annual passes cannot be purchased from the Blackstone NHC as we do not have a store yet.         Visitor Centers                         The John H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor is not a traditional National Park. Instead it is a living landscape, stretching across twenty four cities and towns in two states. Natural, cultural and historic sites are scattered across the landscape, but so much of the experience is just seeing the Blackstone Valley itself: the mills, the villages, and the waterways that tie it all together and powered the drive to industrializing America.
