    "body": "Hydrology               This unit teaches students about the entire hydrologic cycle.  Â    UNIT GOALS:  Students will learn the three phases of water and be able to describe each one. Students will understand each step in the hydrologic cycle and discover where each step occurs on Earth. Students will gain a basic understanding of how the hydrologic cycle transports and recycles water throughout Earth.  UNIT ACTIVITIES: 1. Hydrology Introduction: Gives a brief overview of the hydrologic cycle. 2. Water: Amazing and Phasing: Uses experiments to describe the three phases of water and to demonstrate how these phases change from one to the other. 3. Where did it go? Evaporation?: Uses an experiment to explore evaporation in both freshwater and saltwater. 4. Suck it up, a study of Transpiration: Demonstrates how plants are an important part of the water cycle because they move water from the ground up into the atmosphere. 5. It's all Relative (Humidity): Uses a sling psychrometer (included in Discovery Chest) to measure relative humidity. It also explores how humidity affects local weather. 6. Cloud Formation and Precipitation: Uses a demonstration to make clouds and rain in a box. It also teaches about cloud types and different forms of precipitation. 7. Runoff: Running Through the Watershed: Uses experiments in sand to simulate runoff and demonstrate properties of water on Earth's surface. 8. Ground Water: Water Under Our Feet: Explores the water table and aquifers, and uses an experiment to demonstrate how to find the water table. 9. \"The SLV (solid, liquid, vapor) game\" : Is perfect for younger students, and uses the five senses to introduce the three phases of water to younger children.
