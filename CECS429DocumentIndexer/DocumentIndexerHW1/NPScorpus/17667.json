High points in open areas within the park provide excellent opportunities to view the night sky. In particular, such areas that have little or no artificial lighting are sought by visitors to practice amateur astronomy close to home. Wildlife habitat is more valuable when unimpaired by artificial light. While high open areas in the park may provide opportunities to view the night sky, most of these locations are subject to light pollution from the surrounding Bay Area.
