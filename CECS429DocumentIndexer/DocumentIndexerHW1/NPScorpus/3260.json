Over 160 species of birds have been observed or heard within the monument. Click on the link for a bird list.  This diversity can be explained in part by the Monument's location. The vegetation is dominated by jojoba, followed by palo verde and brittlebush. Other plants include various species of cholla, saguaro, sotol, yucca, agave, ocotillo, and native and nonnative grasses. A small riparian area contains sycamore, walnut, hackberry, and dewberry.
