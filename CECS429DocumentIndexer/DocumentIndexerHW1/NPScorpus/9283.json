    "body": "Plan A Field Trip         Students learn about life sciences through inventory and monitoring activities NPS  Planning a successful field trip takes good communication, time and preparation. Most of our programs are designed to be ranger led and our capacity is limited by staffing levels. We offer field trips from early September through November and from late March through May. May is our busiest month and rapidly fills up. Our early elementary programs take place in our visitor center while the majority of the remaining programs occur in the field. Many of these field studies take place in or near water and require proper student preparation. To get the most out of the programs, students participating in bay programs and some of the beach programs should bring a change of clothing, towel and shoes that can get wet. Bay wading requires footware other than flip flops. The program descriptions document provides a brief overview of the activities for each grade level. Updated lesson plans for each of these activities will be added to this web site as they are completed. If you have questons about the details of the programs, please contact the park Education Office at 410-629-6085 or email the questions to our office.
