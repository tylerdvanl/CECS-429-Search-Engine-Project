Increasing numbers of people with permanent disabilities are opting to use this type of device to help with their mobility. Although wheelchairs are allowed wherever pedestrians are allowed in Yellowstone National Park, stand-up personal vehicles do not meet the description of a wheelchair (see page 22) and their use is limited for safety reasons.  Rules for Using Stand-Up Personal Vehicles  Operators must have a federal Access Pass in their possession.  The Access Pass is free for citizens or permanent residents of the United States who have a medically determined permanent disability that severely limits one or more major life activities, such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working  Stand-up personal vehicles may be used:   On sidewalks.  At paved overlooks, such as Artist Point in the Canyon area.  In campgrounds.   Stand-up personal vehicles are not allowed:   In buildings.  On or along the edges of major roads—because of congestion, visibility, and vehicle speeds.  On boardwalks—because of their proximity to hydrothermal features and the hazards associated with these areas.  On backcountry trails.   Speed limit for stand-up personal vehicles   No greater than 2–3 mph (3–5 km\/h), which is equivalent to walking.       More Information  More about Accessibility in Yellowstone Yellowstone Accessibility Guide (3.2 MB PDF) for visitors who use wheelchairs includes some information on audio and visual accessibility.",
