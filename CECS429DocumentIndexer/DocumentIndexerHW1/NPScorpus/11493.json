    "body": "Reading Room: Photographs: Drakes Estero Wildlife Monitoring Camera - 2007       In this section, you will find directories containing the Wildlife Monitoring Camera photographs taken of the Oyster Bar (OB) harbor seal haul-out site within Drakes Estero during 2007. The camera was generally programmed to capture images every minute during daylight hours and generally operated during the harbor seal breeding season. There may be gaps in the sequence of images when regular camera maintenance occurred and when there were camera malfunctions, dead batteries, full memory cards, etc. When initially made available through this website, the photos in the subsequent directories were not displayed in sequential order. We have since moved the tens of thousands of images from three folders\/directories into multiple subfolders based on day and period of the day in an attempt to make it easier for users to access and find images.
