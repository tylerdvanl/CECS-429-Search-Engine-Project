    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Safety            Safety       This park protects a balance between man made areas and natural ones. They share a watershed and you may encounter the unexpected. Animals are wild, not pets. They may allow you to approach, then become frightened and defend themselves. Keeping you distance, at least ten feet, is one way to ensure that you and the wildlife are safe. The park floods, absorbing water that might damage the surrounding community. Do not enter a flooded area even if it looks shallow. Currents may be faster than they appear. Poison ivy grows in many places in the area. Learn to recognize it and avoid it.",
