NPS photo  Invasive, nonnative plants are one of the greatest threats to the natural ecosystems of the United States, including the Everglades. Also known as exotics, population explosions of nonnative plants can outcompete and displace native plants, thereby disrupting entire ecosystems, including the native wildlife that depends on the native plants. Wildlife that is unable to adapt may leave the area or die out, further altering the ecosystem. The resulting reduction in biodiversity can alter other natural processes, such as fire frequency and intensity.
