During this eight-week summer season, TRTs present educational programs to local school groups and the general public, work on special projects and create standards based lesson plans. Following their season as the park's TRT, teachers will return to their classroom and share their new experiences and resources with their students. If you're interested in learning more about becoming a TRT at Sitka National Historical Park, follow our link to the park's brochure or contact the park's Education Specialist.
