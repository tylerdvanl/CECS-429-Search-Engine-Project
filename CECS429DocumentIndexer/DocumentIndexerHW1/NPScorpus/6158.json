    "body": "Plan A Field Trip       Bringing students to the place where Saint-Gaudens lived and worked allows them to experience the sense of awe and inspiration, the power of place that visiting a historic site can create. It provides students the opportunity to connect with the lives of generations before them; to hear the echoing voices of the past, giving history immediacy and relevance. Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site (site map) hosts many school groups from throughout New Hampshire and Vermont during the school year. The site is available for self-guided walks of the grounds which may be enhanced using the curricula which follows. These may be springboards for other lessons in natural science, theater, etc. A short introduction to the site by a ranger may be possible on the day of your visit, please let us know of your interest. We welcome \"pre-visits\" by teachers to make plans that will go smoothly for all. Sketching and writing are very often a portion of field trips to reflect what they have learned or seen. We do ask that groups are thoughtful of other visitors who would like to read information or take pictures by sharing the common areas. Some schools have used the statues to be the focus of chemistry discussion, ie the making of bronze; those interested in performance may use the Temple area and some togas are available for use; natural science may be studied on the trails at the park; and water quality and testing may be done at the Blow-Me-Down Farm which borders the Connecticut River. We offer a series of ranger led tours which start at the Visitor Center and are offered daily by group size: one ranger per 20-30 students. (Tours may be limited by availability of rangers.)
