With more than 290 square miles of water surface, you can be sure to find a favorite spot to catch the big one. Keep in mind that our park lies within two states and each has their own specific fishing regulations. We have all the information you need below to exprience a fantastic fishing experience.           General Fishing Information To fish within the states of Nevada or Arizona, you must carry with you a valid fishing license. If your license is for Arizona, and you plan to fish from a boat or other craft on lakes Mead and Mohave, or on the shoreline of Nevada, then you must have a \"use stamp\" from Nevada (and vice-versa). A trout stamp is required in addition to any other use stamps if you intend to catch trout. You may purchase licenses from the concessioner at the marinas or at local bait and tackle shops. Largemouth bass, striped bass, channel catfish, crappie, and bluegill are found in both lakes Mead and Mohave. Rainbow trout can be found in Lake Mohave. Fishermen go for the big trout at Willow Beach, while Cottonwood Cove and Katherine offer great bass fishing. Lake Mead has become famous for its striped bass with an occasional catch weighing in at over 40 pounds. Fishing for striped and largemouth bass is good throughout Lake Mead with crappie, blue gill, green sunfish, and catfish being more prevalent in the upper Overton Arm of the lake.      Arizona  A person may fish with two poles with the purchase of a stamp. Each line may not contain more than two hooks or two lures or two artificial flies.  Arizona Game & Fish Dept.  5325 N. Stockton Hill Rd. Kingman, Arizona 86401 (928) 692-7700         Nevada  A person may fish with a second combination of hook, line and rod, if he\/she has in their possession a \"Second Rod Stamp\" in addition to a fishing license.  No more than three baited hooks or fly hooks or two lures or plugs may be used attached to a single line.  The fishing rod must be closely attended when the line is in the water.

In order to not spread the mussel to other bodies of water, please follow the suggestions below. Effective ways boaters (including personal watercraft, canoe, and kayak users) and fisherman can ensure that their boats, vehicles, trailers and other equipment do not spread the mussels to other waters:    1. Drain the water from your motor, live well, and bilge on land before leaving the immediate area of the lake.    2. Completely inspect your vessel and trailer, removing any visible mussels, but also feel for any rough or gritty spots on the hull. These may be young mussels that can be hard to see.    3. Wash the hull, equipment, bilge and any other exposed surface with hot, soapy water or use a 5% solution of household bleach.    4. Clean and wash your trailer, truck or any other equipment that comes in contact with lake water. Mussels can live in small pockets anywhere water collects.    5. Air-dry the boat and other equipment for at least five days before launching in any other waterway. Do not reuse bait once it has been exposed to infested waters.
