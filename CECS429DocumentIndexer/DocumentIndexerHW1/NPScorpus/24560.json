    "body": "Boating and Rafting Permits       Permits are required for all river trips within Dinosaur National Monument. Permits are issued for multiday and single day trips. Play permits are issued for the Green River upstream of the Gates of Lodore boat ramp and downstream of the Split Mountain boat ramp. Boating permits are limited to protect the monument's natural and cultural resources and leave the river canyons unimpaired for future boaters. Multiday trip permits and single-day permits are issued through a lottery process. Private boaters with qualifying experience can apply for a permit. Permit applications, also called lottery applications, are available below. For more general information about river rafting in Dinosaur National Monument visit our river rafting Information page.       Rafters approach the Tiger Wall on the Yampa River. Rafting on the Green and Yampa rivers is a great way to experience the wildness of Dinosaur National Monument. NPS       Multiday Permits Multiday permits are available for both the Green and Yampa Rivers. Generally, the Green River is a four day trip and the Yampa River is a five day trip. The Green River can be floated most of the year. Since dams do not regulate the flow of the Yampa River, its season is dependent on snowmelt. During years with a low snow pack, the river flow may be reduced by late May or early June. In years with a deep snowpack, the river may run well into July.

Permits can be obtained by visiting www.recreation.gov.  During the high-use season, there are two private trip launches available each day. During the low-use season, there is only one launch each day. High\/low season for one-day permits are the same as for the Green River multi-day trips.  Single-Day permit application fee is $15. Single-Day permit fee is $20. Other Information   Daily section permit holders are subject to the same regulations as multi-day trips.   Visitors can only have one permit at a time (i.e. they have to use their daily permit before they can call to get another one), but they can go down the daily section as many times as they want in a season.   All launches need to take place prior to 11:00 am mountain time   Please remember that dogs or other pets are not allowed on the river.   The Green River from Rainbow Park to Split Mountain does contain class III rapids and is not suitable for beginners.         Play Permits A permit is required to boat into the monument from above Gates of Lodore or Deerlodge. Play permits for launches above these locations are issued at the River Office or at the Quarry Visitor Center, seven miles north of Jensen, Utah. This play permit allows groups to launch upstream of Dinosaur National Monument to begin their multi-day trip through the monument. One play permit each day will be issued for groups who wish to take out at Lodore or Deerlodge after 2 pm. A separate play permit is required for rafting the Green River below the Split Mountain boat ramp. Play permits for rafting below Split Mountain are free and are issued at the River Office or at the Quarry Visitor Center, seven miles north of Jensen, Utah. No advanced reservations are necessary. Each play permit is good for groups as large as 25 people. Boaters may take out at Placer Point (small craft only - duckys and kayaks - no rafts) or farther downstream outside the monument boundary. The Green River Campground is not a take-out or put-in location. Much of the land downstream of the monument boundary is private land; boaters are responsible for knowing local rules and regulations for take-out points outside the monument. If you need additional information or would like to contact us, please email the monument river office.       When to Apply High use lottery applications will be accepted December 1, 2015, to January 31, 2016.
