In addition, plants and animals that made up their natural environment still thrive here. Like pieces of a puzzle, each element contributes to the larger picture of Salado culture. Take a virtual tour of Tonto National Monument to learn more about these people and their environment. We recommend a screen resolution of 1024 x 768 to best view the virtual tour.",
