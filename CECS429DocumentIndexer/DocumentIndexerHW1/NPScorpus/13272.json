If you play a video and only hear sound, it may be because you have an old version of Flash (upgrade now). If you click on a video link and the video doesn't play, you can also right-click on the link and choose \"save target as\" or \"save link as\" to save the file to your computer, then play it from Quicktime.  Please let us know if you have any other questions or problems.",
