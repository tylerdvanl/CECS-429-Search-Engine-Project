Photographed by Brian B. Roanhorse 27 October, 2015.      Most park facilities were constructed between 1930 and 1960. Some have been upgraded for accessibility, while others could be used with assistance. Because of the park's natural terrain, only a 1\/2 mile section of the Rim Trail between Sunset and Sunrise Points is wheelchair accessible. The one-mile Bristlecone Loop at Rainbow Point has a hard surface and could be used with assistance, but several grades do not meet standards. Parking is marked at all overlooks and public facilities. Accessible campsites are available in Sunset Campground.VISITOR CENTERTwo moderately sloping ramps lead from the parking lot to the Visitor Center. The building is equipped with a lowered information\/sales desk and fully accessible auditorium with a captioned 22-minute film. Restrooms have fully-accessible stalls.
