Help document what birds are using the park at different elevations during a fun, science-filled weekend. There is no cost for this event. The Bird BioBlitz will be part of the NPS Centennial Celebration, as we support learning about biodiversity in our national parks.  The next BioBlitz is scheduled for May 20-22, 2016, and will focus on birds.  The Midden This is a fantastic publication to catch the highlights of the research projects going on in the park. Learn about projects involving Bats, Beetles and Cave Signatures! Oh My!  Recent Scientific Publications Follow the most current research related to the Great Basin. Here you will find a sampling of the most up-to-date scholarly articles pertaining to this park.     Â    The Diverse Great Basin Imagine a place where hot desert valleys meet mountain ranges with peaks soaring above 13,000 feet. Where prickly pear cactus, sagebrush, aspen, fragile alpine wildflowers and ancient bristlecone pines grow.  Where mountains lions, Clark's nutcrackers, snakes, and jackrabbits roam. Such a place exists, not just in your imagination, but in living color in the Great Basin Region of the western United States.   Great Basin National Park, and the larger region it represents, are diverse in both landforms and living things. Ranging in elevation from 5,000 - 13,000 feet, you will find deserts, playas, mountains, rock formations, fossils, springs, caves, creeks, and even a lone glacier.    Because the Great Basin exhibits such drastic elevation changes from its valleys to its peaks, the region supports an impressive diversity of plant and animal species, from those adapted to the desert to those adapted to forest and alpine environments. In Great Basin National Park and the neighboring valleys alone, there are 11 species of conifer trees, 73 species of mammals, 18 species of reptiles, 238 species of birds, 8 species of fish, and over 800 species of plants. Great Basin National Park does not exist in a vacuum, however. Like all national parks, it faces environmental factors such as air quality threats, invasive species, and water issues, like nearby groundwater pumping.",
