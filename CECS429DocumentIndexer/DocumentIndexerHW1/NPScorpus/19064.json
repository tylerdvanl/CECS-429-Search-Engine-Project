Those portions of the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail authorized by Congress include nearly 1,300 miles of historic trail. The route passes through five states from Illinois to Utah.  Auto Tour Route driving directions take visitors along modern highways that approximate or closely parallel the historic route taken by pioneer wagon trains.  The Links and Resources page provides useful contact information for local land and\/or site managing agencies and organizations along the route.  The page of Suggested Trail Sites to Visit will also be of value for first time visitors. State by state Auto Tour Route (ATR) Interpretive Guides provide an interpretive history of the trail through each state along with directions to sites where trail related interpretive media and\/or educational programs may be found. ATR guides are available at trail related sites, state Welcome Centers, and museums in each state. Electronic copies of these Auto Tour Route Interpretive Guides are also available on the website to download to your computer as Acrobat Reader PDF documents.",
