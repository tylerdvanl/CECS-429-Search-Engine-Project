In search of a route to the Pacific, the band headed north along today's Eastern Shore then moved to the Western Shore to probe the rivers now called Patapsco, Potomac, and Rappahannock. Nearly every day, the crew encountered native people. The meetings were mostly friendly and the Indians gave food and help to Captain Smith and his crew. However, some tribes were hostile to the strangers. The expedition also had to cope with storms. On one occasion, Smith wrote that \"the winde and waters so much increased with thunder, lighting, and raine, that our mast and sayle brew overbord and such mighty waves overracked us in that small barge that with great labour we kept her from sinking by freeing out the water.\"  The voyage nearly ended in tragedy when a stingray seriously wounded Smith. However, he survived and reported eating the ray for supper. His sense of humor expressed itself again when he transformed his vessel to look like a Spanish ship to frighten his fellow colonists.
