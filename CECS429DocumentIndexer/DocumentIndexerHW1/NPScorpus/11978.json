    "body": "Recommended Riding Sites          These are just a few of the possible horseback riding sites in the Santa Monica Mountains. We encourage you to explore more approved trails in the mountains. National Park Service Cheeseboro\/Palo Comado Canyon: there are many entry points, but horse trailers may be parked only in the main lot (entrance near 5800 Cheeseboro Road) or at Old Agoura Park (corner of Driver Ave and Chesebro Road). Trailer parking may be difficult on weekends due to high visitation. Rancho Sierra Vista\/Satwiwa: use equestrian parking lot inside main entrance (at Via Goleta off Lynn Road). Horses are not allowed in Satwiwa Natural Area. Zuma\/Trancas Canyons: trailer parking at Zuma Canyon Trailhead. Solstice Canyon: Limited trails, trailer parking limited to 2 rigs (horse trailer and truck). Riders are strongly urged to ride weekdays only, avoiding weekends due to limited parking and high visitation. Backbone Trail: check different trailheads for access and trailer parking.  Â       California State Parks For access and parking, check out the park map or contact the park for more info.
