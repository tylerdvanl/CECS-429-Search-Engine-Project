When to Watch: July is the best time to watch bears fishing at Brooks Falls. However, bears are in the area from mid spring until mid fall and a few bears may fish at Brooks Falls in September and October. Katmai’s brown bears are most active during daylight hours.  What to Look For: From late June until late July, watch for sockeye (red) salmon jumping the falls and dominant male bears competing for fishing spots. Later in the summer and fall, a few bears may also fish at Brooks Falls. As many as 25 bears have been seen fishing at Brooks Falls at the same time.
