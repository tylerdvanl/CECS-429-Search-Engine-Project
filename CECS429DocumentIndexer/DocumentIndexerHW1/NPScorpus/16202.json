Geologists monitor changes in the Yellowstone caldera by measuring and tracking indicators, such as chloride concentrations in water systems and changes in heat output in thermal areas. They also help the park avoid unintentional impacts to thermal areas from construction and visitor use. The analysts and technicians in the Spatial Analysis Program support park operations with mapping and analyzing spatial data to understand how resources may be interacting with one another. Examples of their work include mapping the roads, trails and utilities in the park along with important resources like rare plants, wolves and historic structures. Staff are also responsible for monitoring air quality, water resources, and natural soundscapes, and assisting in the development of a management plan for winter use. Most recently, the Branch has been analyzing climate data to help park management develop a climate change response and monitoring plan.
