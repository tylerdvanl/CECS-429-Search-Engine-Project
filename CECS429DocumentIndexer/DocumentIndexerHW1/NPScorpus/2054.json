    "body": "Centennial Initiative 2016       A Call to Action  In celebration of the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service in 2016, America invites the world to discover the meaning of national parks to their lives and inspires people to both experience and become devoted to these special places.  On August 25, 2006 – the 90th anniversary of the National Park Service – Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne announced the National Park Centennial Initiative to prepare national parks for another century of conservation, preservation and enjoyment. Since then, the National Park Service has asked citizens, park partners and other stakeholders to express their vision for a second century of national parks.  A nationwide series of more than 40 listening sessions produced more than 6,000 comments that helped to shape five centennial goals. The goals and vision were presented to President Bush and to the American people.  Staff at every national park unit took their lead from this report and created local centennial strategies to describe their vision and desired accomplishments by 2016. There are many great things to come as the National Park Service prepares to celebrate 100 years!  To keep up with the Centennial Initiative, and to experience special features, please visit the centennial \"A Call To Action\" website at http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/calltoaction\/.",
