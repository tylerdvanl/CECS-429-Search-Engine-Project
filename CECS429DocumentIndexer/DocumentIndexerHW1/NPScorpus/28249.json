Farm or Folly: Eisenhower, Nehru, and Khrushchev  A Virtual Ask a Ranger Program Inquiry-Based Virtual Lessons for 7th -12th Graders  January - February, 2016    Farm or Folly: Eisenhower, Nehru, and Khrushchev is a virtual ask-a-ranger program created for those students unable to make it to Gettysburg. It examines Eisenhower's diplomatic skills and use of the Gettysburg farm as a meeting place to intimately discuss international issues with world leaders like the Prime Minister of India and the Premier of the Soviet Union. Students are sent after-action reports, diary entries, letters, and other primary source materials in advance to help them create document and place-based questions for the rangers. All that's required is a classroom capable of projecting a ranger with accompanying film clips on a large screen. Each \"Ask a Ranger\" program will last approximately 45 minutes.   To register for the program, submit the Reservation Request Form. Contact us via e-mail at Gett_Education@nps.gov or call (717) 338-4422 with any questions.",
