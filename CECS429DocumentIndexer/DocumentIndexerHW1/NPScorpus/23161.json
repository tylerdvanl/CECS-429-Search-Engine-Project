    "body": "Explore This Park    Get Involved     Support Your Park             Support Your Park           Â    You can make a gift to benefit our park directly to the National Park Service. If you make the gift directly to the park, the entire gift will be used for the purpose you and the park agree upon. No administrative cost is deducted from your gift directly to the National Park Service. Your check will be deposited in a government account and the full amount will be spent as you intended. Most parks have separate donation accounts for park-specific projects and programs for which you can earmark your gift. Government accounts are non-interest bearing and cannot generate interest between the time it is deposited and the time it is spent.    Visitors to the park can give direct cash or check gifts through our donation boxes. Unlike entrance fees, 100% of donated funds stay in this park.  A donation box is located at the Gila Visitor Center and donations can be made at the Gila Cliff Trailhead by depositing the donation in a donation envelope into the fee box. You may also mail donations to Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument, HC 68 Box 100 Silver City, NM 88061.    Historic objects, manuscripts, books and other related items that have a direct relationship with Gila Cliff Dwellings may be considered for donation to the park's collection, where they are preserved for future generations to enjoy and learn. Contact the park superintendent at (575) 536-9461 to discuss anything you are considering donating to the park's collection.",
