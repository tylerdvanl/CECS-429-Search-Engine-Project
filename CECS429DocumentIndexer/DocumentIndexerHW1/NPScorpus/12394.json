    "body": "Mammals       Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in the late eighteenth century, the San Francisco peninsula was home to a wide variety of mammalian species, including grizzly bears and tule elk.  Since then, physical changes to the environment--along with hunting and urbanization--led to the decline of the larger mammals. Today, the mammalian fauna of the Presidio is primarily composed of typical urban dwellers including squirrels, skunks and raccoons. A recent addition to the Presidio's wildlife is the coyote, several of which have been seen in the area recently. The mammals listed below are the most commonly sighted.
