Â    Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area contains five developed campgrounds which are intended to meet the needs of almost any camper visiting the park. Two campgrounds, Bandy Creek (TN) and Blue Heron (KY) are highly developed sites with many amenities while the Alum Ford Campground (KY) offers a limited number of primitive campsites. Two equestrian campgrounds, Bear Creek (KY) and Station Camp (TN) are both highly developed campgrounds operated by concessionaires. There are no campground stores. The Bandy Creek Stables has a small tack store that carries a few items for campers. Be prepared to bring what you need with you. The stables sells firewood. Campers may also collect any wood that is down and dead. Ice can be purchased at the Bandy Creek Visitor Center.  Camping Fees: Find out the cost to spend the night in the park.   Firewood Notice: Firewood brought in from outside the park is prohibited. We are requesting that firewood not be brought in from outside the park due to non-native insects that can be transported on firewood.
