The etching of these rock spires has been happening over millions of years. The present shapes should be viewed as a mere snapshot in geologic time. 132 Pages,  $26.95 ORDER         Continue shopping:SOUVENIRSAPPARELBARGAIN BASEMENT     RETURN POLICY If you are not happy with your item please return in the original packaging with tags and or receipt within 30 days.
