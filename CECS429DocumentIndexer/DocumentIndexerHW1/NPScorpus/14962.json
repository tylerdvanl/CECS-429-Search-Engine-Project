Those under the age of 18 may volunteer with the official signed permission of a parent or guardian, which will be provided in the Volunteer Agreement Form. What We Provide We will provide an orientation to each new volunteer or group along with training for your specific assignments. Depending on your job, you may be required to wear a uniform. We will provide uniforms to those with public contact responsibilities and may provide reimbursements for other required attire. This will be specified in the job description. For non-local volunteers, we may provide housing and utilities for a minimum of 32 hours of volunteer service per week. The park may provide you with a simply furnished house, motel room, campsite, or RV hookup in a local community.   In the event of an injury while on duty, you will be covered for workers compensation and, in the event of property damage or personal injury, you will be covered for tort claim liability.
