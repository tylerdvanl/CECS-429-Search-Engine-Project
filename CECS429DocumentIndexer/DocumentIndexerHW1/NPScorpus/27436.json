NPS\/Rob Swanson   Â    The visitor center is the best place to begin your visit to the park. Exhibits, films, and a bookstore allow visitors to explore the story of the Minuteman Intercontinental Ballistic Missile System and its role in the larger context of the Cold War.   Exhibits Visitor center exhibits explore the story of the Minuteman Missile's role as part of the United States policy of nuclear deterrence during the Cold War through artifacts, photographs, films, and interactive displays. Getting Tour Tickets To see Delta-01, visitors need to attend a ranger-guided tour. Tickets are given out on a first come, first served basis, the day of the tour at the visitor center. Tickets are limited and often in high demand. It is best to arrive early to obtain tour tickets. Due to the size of the elevator that takes you 31 feet underground, tours are limited to 6 visitors at a time. More To Come  A park feature film is also in production and is due to be finished in the spring of 2017.",
