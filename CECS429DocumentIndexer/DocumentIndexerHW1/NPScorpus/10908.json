    "body": "Blackstone River Bikeway           The Blackstone River Bikeway One of the most exciting projects currently underway in the Heritage Corridor is the construction of the Blackstone River Bikeway. When completed, this bikeway will extend forty-eight miles from downtown Worcester, MA to India Point Park in Providence, RI. From there it will connect with the existing East Bay Bikepath and continue on to Bristol, RI.  The bikeway will serve as an alternate mode of transportation for commuters as well as the region's premiere recreational bicycle facility, connecting New England's second and third largest cities serving a population of more than 1 million.  Currently almost 20 miles of the Bikeway have been completed, including about 14 miles of paved, off-road bike path. The remainder is in marked, on-road routes.
