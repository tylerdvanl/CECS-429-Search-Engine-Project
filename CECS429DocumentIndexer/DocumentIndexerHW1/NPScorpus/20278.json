It served as a train depot from 1888 to 1951, when passenger service to the area was discontinued. The building was opened in 1976 as Jimmy Carter's Presidential Campaign Headquarters and during that time approximately 10,000 people a day came to Plains to find out about candidate Carter. Many state primary victories, as well as the presidential victory, were held in the streets around the depot.         The garden and windmill offer unique insight into life on the farm. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE  The Boyhood Farm was owned by Earl Carter, Jimmy's father, from 1928 until the late 1940s. Jimmy Carter lived here from the age of four until he departed for college. The farm is restored to its appearance before electricity was installed in 1938. As you stroll along the walking path, stop and read the wayside exhibits at various points along the way. Push the buttons on the audio stations to listen to Jimmy Carter share stories about his childhood. Visit the boyhood home and explore the other buildings on the farm.

Gregg Pasterick  Rosalynn Carter Butterfly Trail The butterfly trail in Plains began due to Mrs. Rosalynn Carter's desire to bring awareness to conserving butterflies, their habitats and from her love of nature. Within the Plains Historic District, there are eight (8) public butterfly gardens. It is our hope that when you visit Plains you will take the time and follow the butterfly trail. After visiting the trail, you can also join our trail and help with our conservation efforts by providing some basic information. By joining the trail you indicate that you will provide nectar plants (flowers) as a food source and host plants such as milkweed or parsley on which the butterflies can lay their eggs. Please follow the link for the Rosalynn Carter Butterfly Trail for more information on joining the trail.",
