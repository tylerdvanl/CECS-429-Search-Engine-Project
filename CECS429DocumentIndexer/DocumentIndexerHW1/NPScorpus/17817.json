Strollers are also not permitted and should be left outside the buildings.        Pears   Orchards at the John Muir NHS John Muir grew many different types of fruit and nut trees on his 2,600-acre ranch. The orchard is now only within the 9-acre park area, and is maintained by our park staff. During the year, many of our fruit trees produce fruit. While we allow visitors to take home a small amount of fruit, please be careful when picking a piece of fruit. Branches can be delicate. We like to leave enough fruit for all visitors, so please keep picking to a minimum.          Ranger Matt Holmes giving a tour   Group and School Group Tours We love to share our knowledge and the history of John Muir and this park. If you are bringing a large group and would like a guided tour by one of our rangers, it is necessary to let us know in advance. Teachers need to contact the visitor center in order to receive the introductory packet for school groups. Scheduling in advance helps us to keep your National Park staffed safely and appropriately.          Trail on Mount Wanda.   Getting Around There are paved pathways through the 9 acres of orchards which surround the Muir home. Transportation will be provided to visitors who are unable to walk up to the Muir home. John Muir NHS is for pedestrians only, no bicycles or motor vehicles are allowed in the park. Mt. Wanda is accessible for pedestrians, mountain bikers and horses. The single track nature trail is for pedestrians only. Parking for Mt. Wanda is at the Cal-Trans Park and Ride lot at the corner of Franklin Canyon Rd. and Alhambra Ave. A note to hikers: You can only access the main John Muir NHS property (not Mount Wanda) through the Visitor Center on Alhambra Avenue.        Suggested Reading You may like to read \"Son of the Wilderness, The Life of John Muir\", written by Pulitzer Prize-winner Linnie Marsh Wolfe, which is required reading for all rangers and volunteers at John Muir NHS. The only book John Muir ever wrote for children is the story he told his two daughters around the dining room table. That story of a small black dog with a big curly tail and an even bigger heart is called: \"Stickeen\".        Books Written by Muir  Picturesque California 1888 Our National Parks 1901 E.H.
