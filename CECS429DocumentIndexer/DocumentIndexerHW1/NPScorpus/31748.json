Farmed and timbered until the 1940's, this forested area now has a great diversity of plants and river wildlife. Remnants of the area's human history remain, waiting to be discovered by observant hikers. The Bluestone Turnpike Trail connects on the north end with Bluestone State Park's campground road, just past the Old Mill Campground. On the south end at Pipestem Resort State Park, this trail connects with the Farley Loop Trail and River Trail. These trails can be accessed from the Mountain Creek Lodge, at the base of the tram at Pipestem Resort State Park.          Hiking along the Bluestone River   Hunting is permitted during certain seasons.
