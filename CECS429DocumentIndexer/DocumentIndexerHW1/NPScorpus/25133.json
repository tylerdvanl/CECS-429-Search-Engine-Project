    "body": "GIS and GPS Data       GIS  Geographic Information Systems (GIS) manage spatial data for display in map form. This technology is becoming increasingly accessible to the general public through applications such as Google Earth, World Wind, etc. These applications read files in KML or KMZ format and display the information overlaying their base display. Here, we have listed a number of layers in KML format for download. The files display various features of interest in the Denali area.  Download Instructions: To download these files click on the link. You will be presented with the choice to either open the file with a specified program or save the file to your disk. Selecting the first choice will open the program, such as Google Earth, and then display the feature.

GPS  GPS technology that uses signals from orbiting satellites to determine one's location on the ground has exploded in popularity and is increasingly being used in personal equipment including handheld GPS, Cars, and cell phones. Provided here are coordinates for the boundary of Denali National Park and Preserve, including the park wilderness.  Note: all locations are approximate and the accuracy of positions depends in part on the GPS equipment used and observation conditions.  Park Boundary Information",
