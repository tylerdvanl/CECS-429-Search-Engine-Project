These docks are not available for overnight - boats must anchor in the harbor overnight. There are no public docks at loggerhead.

Because of sensitive resource issues, any individual or group wishing to fly a private seaplane to the park must have a Special Use Permit issued through Everglades National Park. There are no facilities at the Dry Tortugas National Park so all seaplanes must have enough fuel and supplies for a round trip flight. Information on how to acquire a permit may be found here. There is no fuel, water, charcoal, or food service available in the park. Getting Around Upon arrival, check in with a Park Ranger to file required permits as well as find out about tours at the park.
