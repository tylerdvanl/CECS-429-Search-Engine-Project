Under the 2004 Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA) majority of the fees collected directly benefit the park. In 1997, the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Forest Service were directed by Congress to implement the Recreational Fee Demonstration Program. In 2004 the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act replaced the 1997 Recreational Fee Demonstration Program.
