NPS\/Ted Toth  Since the first Western Reserve farmers arrived in the Cuyahoga Valley, farm children balanced chores with education. On larger farms, parents needed their children's help to manage the farm and sell its products. In addition, children went to school, participated in extracurricular sports and activities, and completed their homework. On the farm, children had important responsibilities, from milking cows to picking and selling corn at a roadside stand. Their labor affected the success of the family's farm. To earn extra money, teenagers and young adults often got part-time jobs building roads, drilling wells, or working for other local businesses.          In Their Own Words Click the topics to hear stories about Cuyahoga Valley life.
