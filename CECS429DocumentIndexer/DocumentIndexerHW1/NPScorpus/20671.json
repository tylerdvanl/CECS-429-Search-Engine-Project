NPS  This house, built in 1665 in Lewes, Delaware by early Dutch settlers, is thought to be built thirty years after the destruction of the nearby ill-fated Zwaanendael colony, one of the first Dutch settlements in America, and first European settlement in Delaware. It survived the Lord Baltimore raids, which eventually led to the English taking control of the area. The house was purchased in 1723 by its namesake, Ryves Holt, who served as the first Chief Justice of Delaware from 1745 until his death in 1763.
