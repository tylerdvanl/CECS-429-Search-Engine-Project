    "body": "Fire Management       Fire is a natural process that has shaped the plant communities at Pinnacles National Park. The goal of the new fire management plan is to mimic natural conditions, allowing native plant species to thrive. Park managers will consider using prescribed fire in areas that have not burned for a long time or where ecosystems have been altered by negative human impacts. Prescribed fire will only be used when weather conditions are safe for burning. The Pinnacles National Park Fire Management Plan and Environmental Assessment are available online. If you have a dial-up connection, the plan has been divided into smaller sections for easier downloading.
