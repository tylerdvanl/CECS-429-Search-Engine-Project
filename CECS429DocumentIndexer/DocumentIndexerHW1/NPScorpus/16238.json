    "body": "Bull Snake        A bull snake on the terraces at Mammoth Hot Springs. Bull snakes are one of six reptile species found in the park. NPS\/Neal Herbert       Scientific Name Pituophis catenifer sayi Identification  A subspecies of the gopher snake, is Yellowstone's largest reptile, ranging from 50 to 72 inches long. Yellowish with a series of black, brown, or reddish-brown blotches down the back; the darkest, most contrasting colors are near the head and tail; blotches are shaped as rings around the tail. Head resembles a turtle's in shape, with a protruding scale at the tip of the snout and a dark band extending from the top of the head through the eye to the lower jaw.  Habitat   In Yellowstone, found at lower elevations, drier, warmer climates, and open areas such as near Mammoth.  Behavior   Lives in burrows and eats small rodents—behavior that gave the gopher snake its name. Often mistaken for a rattlesnake because of its appearance and its defensive behavior: when disturbed it will coil up, hiss loudly, and vibrate its tail against the ground, producing a rattling sound.        More Information  More on Reptiles: Bull Snake, Prairie Rattlesnake, Rubber Boa, Sagebrush Lizard, Valley Garter Snake, and Wandering Garter Snake",
