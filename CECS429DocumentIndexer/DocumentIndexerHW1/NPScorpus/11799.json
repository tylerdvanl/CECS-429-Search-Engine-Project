If you encounter any downed trees, please report them to the Bear Valley Visitor Center (415-464-5100 x2 x5) or to Shawn Maloney (415-464-5154). Please provide as many details as possible, i.e., exact location of the tree on which trail, type of tree (bay, fir, etc.), whether it is bushy or straight, its size and diameter, whether it is on the ground or elevated, whether equestrians can get around it.     Cross Marin Trail As of July 24, 2011, the Cross Marin Trail is closed to all uses between the Jewel Trail junction and Devils Gulch due to a culvert blow-out a short distance south of the Jewel Trail Junction. Please do not use this section of trail until the trail has been repaired. Olema Valley Trail seasonal flooding During the winter and spring, the Olema Valley Trail is often flooded and very muddy in a number of locations and hikers on this trail in the winter and spring may wish to wear or bring along knee-high waterproof boots. There is a ford just south of the Teixeira trail junction at which the water is frequently knee-deep and opaque with silt, the current strong, and the bottom uneven and covered with unstable, loose stones. This section of Olema Valley Trail is subject to seasonal (winter\/spring) flooding. If you have recently hiked any of the trails in Point Reyes National Seashore and found the trail conditions other than what is reported here, please email us to let us know. Thanks for your assistance.      Area Road Closures For information on area road closures, check the Marin Sheriff's, the CalTrans',and CHP's (select \"Bay Area\" in the upper left corner, then look for \"Marin\" in the Area column) websites.      Top of Page Beach Closures Due to the Cosco Busan oil spill, beaches in Point Reyes National Seashore may be temporarily closed to the public at any time.

All public use is prohibited. Reproductive monitoring of western snowy plovers at Point Reyes has previously demonstrated that chick mortality is higher on weekend days than weekdays. Disturbance by park visitors in plover breeding areas can separate chicks from the adults, and the chicks may then not be able to forage efficiently, thermoregulate properly, and hide from predators. In 2013, for example, of the 11 newly hatched chicks in the proposed closure area, only 3 survived past the July 4 weekend.
