    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Things To Do     Outdoor Activities     Off-Road Vehicle Use                 Off-Road Vehicle Use              Nearly impossible to reach by foot, generations have explored remote areas of the preserve using homemade airboats or swamp buggies. Today, people enjoy this traditional activity along an extensive trail system.  Off-road vehicle operation on designated trails for hunting, fishing, frogging, camping, wildlife observation, transportation to private property, and other traditional nature-based activities are consistent with the Big Cypress National Preserve enabling legislation and the Addition Act, and are, therefore authorized in the Preserve.      Operation of off-road vehicles in excess of the authorized speed limit, off designated trails or for the purpose of challenging the vehicle against Preserve resources, or other vehicles, such as racing, mudding, sport riding, motocross riding, and competitive events, is not consistent with the Big Cypress National Preserve enabling legislation, or the Addition Act. These non-traditional pursuits damage the resource and, therefore, are not authorized in Big Cypress National Preserve. Engaging in these activities can result in forfeiture of off-road vehicle access privileges.      Please note: Off-road vehicle use requires appropriate permits. Permits are issued at the Off-Road Vehicle Office.      To learn more about off-road vehicle recreation within the national preserve, please use the following links.
