    "body": "Explore This Park    Get Involved     Partners            Partners       The treaty which led to the resolution of the 100-year Chamizal land dispute was made possible only through the goodwill and collaboration of the governments of the United States, Mexico, El Paso, Ciudad Juarez, and many agencies and groups within them. Partnership was an essential part of that process, and it continues to be an important part of our story. In fact, the law which gave birth to this national park unit states, \"The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to cooperate and consult with the city and county of El Paso, Texas, Texas Western College (now University of Texas at El Paso), local historical and preservation societies, and other interested government agencies, associations and persons in the utilization and preservation of the Chamizal National Memorial.\"  Current Partners The following organizations, in no particular order, have recently worked with us to provide services and programs for memorial visitors from around the community and afar.  The Mexican Consulate-General in El Paso City of El Paso, including Parks and Recreation and Museums and Cultural Affairs Department Texas Parks & Wildlife Department The El Paso chapter of Ecoclubs International Project Vida Student Conservation Association University of Texas at El Paso Western National Parks Association Los Paisanos de El Chamizal AARP Senior Community Service Employment Program Local schools, media outlets, and artists Friends Group If you, as an individual or organization, would like to support the work of Chamizal National Memorial, we encourage you to become a member of the new Friends Group that is currently being formed. Many of our nation's parks have friends groups that serve as valuable ambassadors for their local park unit. They help support interpretive, educational and cultural activities through fundraising, membership programs, friendraising, and awareness building.
