Duration:5 minutes, 12 seconds               Tips and Additional Information Be sure to check for opening and closing dates for facilities inside the park.   Make your reservations early!  Overnight camping of any type (tent, vehicle, or RV) outside designated campgrounds is not permitted.  Campsite occupancy is limited to 6 people per site. Camping is limited to 14 days from July 1 through Labor Day (first Monday in September) and to 30 days the rest of the year; no limit at Fishing Bridge. Drinking water is normally available in all campgrounds with occasional exceptions.  Campfires, including those in portable wood or propane fire pits, are prohibited in the Fishing Bridge RV Park. Wood and charcoal fires are permitted in all other campground locations, though special fire restrictions are occasionally put in place when the danger of wildland fires is great. If you plan to light a fire in the park, please check the information board at the campground or email our Visitor Services Office prior to your visit. Propane grills and stoves are normally not restricted. Fishing Bridge RV Park is the only campground offering water, sewer, and electrical hookups-50 amp service; it is for hard-sided vehicles only (no tents or tent-trailers are allowed).  Learn more about backpacking in the park on our Backcountry Camping and Hiking page.
