For visitors who spend a few hours or a few days on Cumberland this soon becomes apparent. Wind shapes the dunes, Fire shapes the plant and animal communities that depend on them, and humans leave their impact too. Cumberland Island supports a rich diversity of animals, plants and offers amazing views of the Atlantic Ocean and Cumberland Sound. The rich marsh environment as well as the deep night sky hold something for everyone.",
