Live oak, post oak, mesquite, juniper, native pecan, sugar hackberry, yaupon, and sumac are abundant. Among the approximately 100 types of grasses that grow here are little bluestem, bushy bluestem, Canada wild rye, switchgrass, and eastern gamma grass. Dove weed (Croton), giant ragweed, and goldenrod are common. Over 25 species of conspicuous wildflowers bloom in profusion during spring and early summer.  Â      A scissor-tailed flycatcher ignores a \"no-parking\" regulation.   Bird inventories within the park reflect the mingling of eastern and western species and races characteristic of the avifauna of the Edwards Plateau. Although some Hill Country specialties are rarely found, eastern and western subspecies commonly overlap. Many of the approximately forty permanent resident species, along with numerous summer residents, nest within the park. Of the permanent residents are the  Eastern Bluebird Blue Jay Northern Mockingbird Mourning Dove Cardinal Northern Bobwhite Eastern Phoebe Bewick's and Carolina Wrens.  Summer visitors nesting in the park include  Summer Tanager Painted Bunting Black-chinned Hummingbird Scissor-tailed Flycatchers and a variety of swallow species  Migrations in the spring are normally light, but among the species of migrating warblers are the Yellow Warbler and Common Yellowthroat. Especially during the winter, the Pedernales River hosts a number of duck species, cormorants, shorebirds, and waders.",
