    "body": "Dr. Carter G. Woodson: The Father of African American History  Before Dr. Carter G. Woodson, there was very little accurate written history about the lives and experiences of Americans of African descent. Today a National Historic Site, Dr. Woodsonâ€™s home served as the headquarters for the Association for the Study of African American Life and History. Dr. Woodson established Negro History Week here in 1926, which we celebrate today as Black History Month.              Woodson Home Planning Process   The National Park Service is currently planning the future use of the Carter G. Woodson Home NHS.  Learn more about this process.",
