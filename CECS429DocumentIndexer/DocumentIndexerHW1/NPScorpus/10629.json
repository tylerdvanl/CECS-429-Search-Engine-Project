    "body": "Partners         Twelfth year members of Barnstable County AmeriCorps Cape Cod AmeriCorps Cape Cod  We are proud of our park partnerships that continue to flourish and grow within the national seashore. A mix of government, non-profit organizations, and institutional and for-profit groups work together to protect and research park resources, and provide visitor services and programs, enhancing the ability of the National Park Service to carry out its mission. There are several park partner groups that operate through partnership arrangements, as well as formal fundraising agreements. Many of these partners are noted on Cape Cod National Seashore’s web pages.  Cape Cod National Seashore recognizes private philanthropy as both a long-standing tradition of the national parks and as a vital element of National Park Service (NPS) success. Funds raised by partner organizations and volunteer hours contributed by individuals and organizations provide a strong connection between the donor and the park. The park appreciates the generosity of those who donate their time or their funds directly, as well as those who work through non-profit organizations for the park’s and the public’s benefit.  Park partnerships are carried out under the auspices of the National Park Service and support the NPS mission. We have a strong commitment to safety and resource protection, and we strive to ensure that partners and volunteers share this commitment. In addition, park visitors and community members often view partners and volunteers as extensions of park staff. Therefore, the conduct of partner staff and volunteers must exemplify the highest standards of conduct and service, including customer service to all who are encountered when partners and volunteers carry out their work.  EASTERN NATIONAL   Eastern National promotes the public's understanding and support of more than 130 of America's national parks and other public trusts. At Cape Cod National Seashore, Eastern National manages the gift and book stores in the visitor centers, returning a percentage of the proceeds to the seashore for interpretation, education, and research. The bookstores are an extension of the seashore’s interpretive program; items are selected because they reflect the seashores resources and themes, they have educational value, and they enhance public understanding. Eastern National also operates the gift and book store at Highland Light, and conducts tours to the top of this tower, with it rich history as the first lighthouse on Cape Cod, and its commanding view of the Outer Cape.   Eastern National's contributions have benefited the seashore and visitors in many ways. Eastern National frequently sponsors interpretive programs for visitors, such as an annual Wampanag culture event, National Junior Ranger Day, and speaker programs at visitor centers. For many years Eastern National has underwritten the seashore’s Junior Ranger Program, introducing thousands of youngsters to the unique resources here and the importance of protecting them in the future. Eastern National funds are used to produce the annual seashore newspaper, as well as research about significant seashore resources, such as Old Harbor Life-Saving Station and the historic hay barge that is on display at Salt Pond Visitor Center. In addition, Eastern National funds the national seashore’s cell phone interpretation program.  Eastern National was chartered in 1948. Its policies and programs are guided by an elected board of directors. The board, the members and the staff are dedicated to the preservation and use of the parks for the benefit of all Americans, visitors from all nations and future generations. Eastern National currently operates educational retail outlets in 30 states, from Maine to the Caribbean. Since 1947, Eastern has donated over $95 million to the National Park Service.
