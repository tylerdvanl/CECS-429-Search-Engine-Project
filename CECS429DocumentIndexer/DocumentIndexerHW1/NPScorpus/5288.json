NPS PHOTO  Science guides park planning and policies Gateway is a large, complex coastal park. We use science every day to insure visitor safety and protect natural and cultural resources. Water quality, salt marsh survival and coastal issues related to climate change are just a few examples of the ongoing work of National Park Service scientists.  Climate change and Gateway As a coastal park, we must pay close attention to how climate change will affect Gateway. We must also work cooperatively with coastal area communities toward a sustainable future.  Getting to the core of Sandy Hook Geologists at Rutgers University, in cooperation with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Education, recently conducted an analysis of several core samples of the Sandy Hook peninsula. See what they found out about the glacial and postglacial history of the Hook.   Â        Recording data from one of Jamaica Bay's salt marshes. NPS PHOTO  Gateway Research Learning Center The Gateway Research Learning Center, formerly called the Jamaica Bay Institute, was created as a testament to this commitment. The mission of the Learning Center is to promote and improve the ecological health and social relevance of Jamaica Bay through research, education and informed decision making. Through partnerships with academic institutions, state, and federal agencies, Gateway National Recreation Area is able to gain access to sophisticated and multidisciplinary scientific information. This up- to-date scientific knowledge will be shared with park management, local community leaders, and the public to foster science-based decisions. Important aspects of the science investigations needed at Gateway are urban ecology themes, including: environmental justice, resource conservation versus visitor access and integrated management of cultural and natural resources. Although these projects are of high importance, we welcome research proposals in any area of scientific, historic, cultural, or social inquiry.",
