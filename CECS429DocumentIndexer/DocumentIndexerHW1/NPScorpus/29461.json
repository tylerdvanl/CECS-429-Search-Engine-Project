    "body": "Permits & Reservations         NPS  Tour Reservations Reservations are required for groups of ten or more. Please call (914) 667-4116 and speak with a staff member to confirm a group tour reservation. A one-week advance notice is necessary. Voice mail messages cannot be used for confirmation.   Permits A Special Use Permit is required for any activity that provides a benefit to an individual, group, or organization rather than the park or the public at large. Many of the events that require permits also require some degree of oversight from National Park Service staff.      First Amendment Activities We encourage citizens to exercise rights guaranteed by the Constitution. However, the courts have recognized that activities associated with the exercise of these rights may be reasonably regulated to protect the public and park resources. Therefore, such First Amendment activities involving over 25 participants require special use permits and National Park Service staff may regulate the time, place, and manner in which they are conducted. Some examples are:   distribution and\/or sale of printed matter  religious services  public demonstrations or assemblies, etc.  collecting signatures for petitions  View and print the Special Use Permit Instructions and Requirements for Saint Paul's Church National Historic Site    Commercial Filming and Photography A permit is required for any filming or photography done by photojournalists and other members of the media within the boundary of the Saint Paul's Church NHS.
