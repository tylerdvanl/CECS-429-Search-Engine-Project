Follow the small path at the post office end of the parking lot towards the river.   From here you can see two waterfalls. The larger dam, known as the Middle Dam, was built in 1849. It is 300 feet long, and creates a twenty foot drop. Behind the dam is the 170 acre Lower Slatersville Reservoir. The smaller dam was built later to increase the water power. The sluice gate here controlled the amount of water flowing into the raceway that powered the Slatersville Mill  Â     Introduction 1 Slatersville Reservoir 2 Slatersville Library and Western Mills 3 Slatersville Mills 4 Slatersville Worker Housing 5 Slatersville Church and Common 6 John Slater House 7 North Smithfield Town Hall 8 Slatersville Commercial Blocks",
