These cabins provide a great opportunity to stay overnight in Kenai Fjords. You can experience the solitude and enjoyment of your park, no matter the season, while still enjoying a roof over your head.   Two coastal public use cabins are available on the Kenai Fjords coast during the summer months (generally Memorial Day to Labor Day).
