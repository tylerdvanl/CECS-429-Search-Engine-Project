When you come to the park, find a Boston National Historical Park Visitors Center. A park ranger, or volunteer, can give you a copy of the Junior Ranger Handbook. If you can't wait to get your hands on one, you can download a copy here. When you complete the activities in your book, bring it to a Visitor Center, the Bunker Hill Monument, or the Bunker Hill Museum. A park ranger will present you with a Junior Ranger badge. Enjoy and we hope to see you at our park!",
