Whether it is viewing your first night sky, experiencing a float down the river, enjoying a scenic overlook, or simply being here, memories of Big Bend and its environment are oftentimes the strongest. Unfortunately a number of issues are negatively affecting many of these special experiences.  In the coming years, we hope that interest from the visiting public and concern for the longterm stability of park resources will shape how this park is managed.",
