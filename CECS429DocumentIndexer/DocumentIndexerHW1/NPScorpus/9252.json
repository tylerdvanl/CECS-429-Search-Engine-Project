The first project, with Maryland State Highway Administration’s Coordinated Highways Action Response Team (CHART), is an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). CHART uses the ITS to monitor traffic and roadway conditions, respond to and manage highway traffic incidents and provide traveler information. CHART employs technology including:   Closed-circuit television cameras to detect hazardous conditions and allow CHART to advise motorists using message boards placed along the roadways;   Weather information stations to inform decisions about how to most effectively treat roads and manage traffic during severe weather; and   Traffic detectors to provide speed and volume information.   The Baltimore-Washington Parkway joins most other Maryland highways in using the ITS, and adding it will improve system-wide coordination and facilitate effective traffic management on the parkway. Though the cameras are live-feed only and do not have the ability to record, the NPS will use the CHART information to develop maintenance plans. The ITS will be installed along the parkway at:   Maryland 175(southbound)   Maryland 32 (northbound)   Maryland 197 (southbound and northbound)   Brock Bridge (southbound)   Powder Mill Rd. (southbound)   Maryland 193 (northbound)   Maryland 202 (northbound)   Click for more information about CHART. The second project, partnered with the Federal Highway Administration, will repave the Route 197 and 193 interchange ramps and smooth roadway bumps at the Route 197 north and southbound overpasses, until more comprehensive repairs are completed in 2018. “Making the Baltimore-Washington Parkway safer and more pleasant to drive is a top priority,” Matthew Carroll, Baltimore-Washington Parkway superintendent, said. “The National Park Service is working closely with the Federal Highway Administration to identify the most urgent needs and address them as quickly as we can.” Drivers should plan for delays during paving operations, but in an effort to minimize inconvenience, all lanes will remain open during morning and evening rush hours, 5:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.  Monday through Friday. Ramps will be closed for night work from 7:30 p.m. to 5:30 a.m.Monday through Friday, and over weekends from 7:30 p.m. Friday to 5:30 a.m. Monday. Detours will be posted. View the Federal Highway Administration’s project site for up-to-date construction information. Both projects are scheduled to be completed in early 2016.
