The campaign's goals are to introduce kids to a range of healthy, educational, outdoor activities that they can enjoy for a lifetime. These programs include family-friendly activities that are \"medium\" to \"high\" intensity and that have an interpretive component. At our park we have several ongoing and special event Junior Ranger programs that apply:  Urban Wilderness Canoe Adventures (ongoing) Rowing burns approximately 450 calories\/hour Bike with a Ranger (ongoing) Moderate cycling burns approximately 550 calories\/hour Geocaching (ongoing) Geocaching burns approximately 380 calories\/hour  Snowshoeing (special event) Snowshoeing burns approximately 400 calories\/hour  Each Junior Ranger that participates in this program will receive a special certificate indicating that they completed the requirements to become a Junior Ranger, but also the \"Let's Move Outside\" campaign. Special event programming will be advertised as they become available.",
