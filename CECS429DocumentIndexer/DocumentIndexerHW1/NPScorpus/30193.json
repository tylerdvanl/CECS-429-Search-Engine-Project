The national monument was established by a proclamation signed by President Warren G. Harding in 1923 to preserve prehistoric mounds of \"great historic and scientific interest.\" In 1980 Congress expanded the monument, adding a portion of the Hopeton Earthworks and directed the National Park Service to investigate other regional archeological sites for their suitability for preservation. Four sites were recommended. Hopewell Culture National Historical Park was established on May 27, 1992 by a law that renamed the Mound City Group National Monument, expanded the Hopeton Eathworks unit, and authorized the acquisition of three additional sites: High Bank Works, Hopewell Mound Group, and Seip Earthworks.",
