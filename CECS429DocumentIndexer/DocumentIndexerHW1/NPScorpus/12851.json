NPS Photo    Mosses, liverworts, and hornworts (collectively called bryophytes) are non-vascular plants and do not produce seeds or flowers. Mosses can be seen in many wet areas of the park growing on trees, rocks, and the ground. In 2003 the SOBEFREE retreat (conducted by the Bryolab at University of California Berkeley) came to Whiskeytown to inventory bryophytes and educate graduate students in conducting field inventory research. During this weekend trip, more than 150 readily identified species were found in the park.",
