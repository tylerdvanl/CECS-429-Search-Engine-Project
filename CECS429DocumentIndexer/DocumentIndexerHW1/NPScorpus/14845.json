With kids, it comes naturally.  \"Where does that hole go?\"  \"Eww, what is that thing? ... Can I touch it?\" The park offers several activities for families, and for kids to do by themselves.  Trog Tour (for children 8-12) No Parents Allowed! Twelve children voyage overland and underground with two rangers for a kids'-eye view of the world's longest known cave.             Introduction to Caving (for children 10 and up, and parents) Families can join in the exploration together on Introduction to Caving, and hike, climb, and even crawl through parts of Mammoth Cave that most tours never visit.  Nature Track for Kids Ranger-led programs draw kids together for fun games with a little something extra – a sense of discovery about the place each of us holds in our environment. (Seasonally, refer to the activity schedules. 45 min.)         Junior Ranger Program Kids can get a Junior Ranger booklet at the Visitor Center Information Desk, attend ranger-led activities, choose activities in the booklet to earn \"bat points,\" and receive their Junior Ranger badge and certificate at the Information Desk. But don't think it's going to be easy... You've got to use your eyes and ears to gather all the information you need to know. Kids can also check out and become part of the new Junior Ranger World Heritage Program at the following link: Junior Ranger World Heritage Program",
