The digitized registers span 57 years, from 1865-1922. The guests of the Volcano House signed the registers and included detailed illustrations, anecdotes from their visits, calling cards, poems, and comics. Below are the first seven volumes of the registers held by Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park Archives. In cooperation with the National Park Service, staff from the University of Hawaii at Hilo Geology Department digitized the volumes, making them available for researchers and the general public. The volumes provide invaluable information regarding earthquakes, volcanic activity, genealogy, and culture of the area. The following list includes .pdfs of the registers and transcriptions of the registers provided by Darcy Bevens, Education Specialist at University of Hawaii at Hilo Center for the Study of Active Volcanoes. The register images have a digital watermark. Clean copies of specific pages for publication can be obtained by filling out the Research Request form and subsequently the Reproduction and Use Request form found under the Conducting Research section of the Archive page.      Please note: These are rather large files.
