    "body": "4WD Roads in the Needles        Driving up Elephant Hill NPS Photo by Neal Herbert   Â    About 50 miles of challenging backcountry roads lead to campsites, trailheads and many natural and cultural features. All of these roads require high-clearance, four-wheel-drive vehicles. Inexperienced drivers are discouraged from attempting these roads as the risk of vehicle damage is great and towing expenses typically exceed $1,000. If you plan to explore Needles' four-wheel-drive roads, please remember the following:  A high-clearance, four-wheel-drive vehicle (low range) is required for all Needles district backcountry roads. All vehicles and bikes must remain on designated roads. ATVs, UTVs, and OHVs are not permitted. Motorbikes must be highway-legal. Pets are not permitted, even in vehicles. All vehicles must be registered and operated by a licensed driver. Roads may close intermittently due to poor driving conditions or weather. More Road Condtions  Permits  Day-use permits are required on Elephant Hill, Salt Creek \/ Horse Canyon, and Lavender Canyon roads. Permits are required for all overnight trips in the backcountry.  During the spring and fall, demand for permits frequently exceeds the number available. If you plan to visit Canyonlands during peak season, it is recommended that you make reservations well in advance.    Drive Carefully!
