In Stehekin, the Stehekin Valley Road is open to cyclists to three miles above High Bridge but is unpaved beyond Harlequin Campground. Space for bikes can be reserved on the Lady of the Lake ferry or bicycles can be rented from Discovery Bikes in Stehekin. The Stehekin Shuttle also includes built-in bicycle racks.  In the Methow Valley, the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest offers opportunities for road cycling and mountain biking.  Other roads, including the Cascade River Road and SR 542, are also at least partially accessible by bicycle. Check the road condition pages for the national park and the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie and Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forests for current information on these and other roads.",
