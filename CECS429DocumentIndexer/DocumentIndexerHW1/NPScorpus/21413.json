NPS Photo   Â   The Subsistence Resource Commission (SRC) provides a venue for local subsistence users to have input into the management of subsistence resources in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park. The purpose of the Commission is to recommend to the Governor of Alaska and the Secretary of the Interior a program for subsistence hunting within Wrangell-St. Elias National Park. Since the establishment of the federal subsistence management program in 1990, the SRC has also been making recommendations on proposals for hunting and fishing regulations (e.g., harvest limits, seasons, and customary and traditional use determinations) affecting Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve directly to the federal subsistence Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) and the Federal Subsistence Board. The Commission is comprised of nine local rural residents representing geographic, cultural, and user diversity from within the region. SRC members are appointed by the governor (3 members), the Secretary of the Interior (3 members), and the federal subsistence RACs (one each from the Southcentral, Eastern Interior and Southeast RACs). The current members (2016) are:   Karen Linnell, Chair (Glennallen) Dan Stevens, Vice Chair (Chitina)Sue Entsminger (Mentasta Pass)  Donald Horrell (Tazlina) Gloria Stickwan (Tazlina)  Robert Fithian (Lower Tonsina)  Suzanne McCarthy (Gakona)Raymond Sensmeier (Yakutat)Vacant (Secretary of the Interior appointee)  The SRC generally meets twice a year in September\/October and February\/March. Meetings are open to the public, and public comments are welcome.",
