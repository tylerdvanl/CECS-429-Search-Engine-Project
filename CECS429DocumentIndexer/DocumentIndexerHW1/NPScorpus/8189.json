    "body": "Ranger-led Activities         A wildlife talk NPS\/Tim Rains  Join us in Summer! Our scheduled activities include a variety of ranger-led programs, from easy walks and evening talks, to all-day hikes and boat tours. The Native America Speaks program, outdoor education programs, and interpretive boat tours are also presented by our park neighbors and partners. Our monthly Ranger-led Activity Schedules are made available about 2 weeks before the start of the month. Programs start mid-June and generally conclude at the end of September. Please see our Brochures and Publications page for a schedule of activities. Evening programs are available in the campgrounds most nights.  You photographers (and instagramers) out there may enjoy our special Photo Walks and Instameets.        A ranger-led showshoe walk NPS\/Marc Neidig  Join Us in Winter! In lieu of hiking boots, strap on snowshoes and join a ranger for a 2 hour snowshoe in the Apgar area. These programs are offered Saturday and Sunday throughout the winter. Take an intimate look at the park searching for signs of wildlife, discovering plants and animals, and enjoying the solitude of winter during this unique experience. More details will be posted as the season approaches.        Planning Children are welcome on interpretive activities, but should always be accompanied by an adult. Cost Most programs are free of charge. Boat trips that include a ranger-guided hike and some of the Native America Speaks programs have a cost associated with them. Our Ranger-led Activities Schedule includes details on pricing. Reservations You do not need a reservation on most of our Ranger-led activities, however, there are a few cases when advance planning would be prudent because of limited space:   The hikes associated with a boat tour tend to fill up quickly, so you should contact Glacier Park Boat Co. for a reservation or visit one of their ticket offices.  You should make reservations for the International Peace Park hike as it has a space limit of 35 people. You can pre-register at the St. Mary Visitor Center (406-732-7750) or the Waterton Lakes Visitor Centre in Waterton (403-859-5133). You can add your name to that list at any of the visitor centers. There is a fee for the return boat trip back to Canada.  What to Bring Hiking  Sturdy foot gear is a must for all but the very easiest of hikes. Everyone should have good boots, with strong support, to help prevent ankle injuries. Bring water with you! The mountains can get very hot in the summer. Surface water in the park may be unsafe to drink. Mosquitoes and flies can be bothersome. Come prepared with repellent to meet some of Glacier's smaller wildlife species. A day of hiking can expose you to more sun and UV rays than normal. Wear a hat and sunscreen. It will help keep you cool and prevent a sunburned scalp! Weather can change quickly. Come prepared with rain gear for summer showers. Bring something to eat while you are in the backcountry. If you are on an all-day hike or a hike over the noon hour, you'll get mighty hungry without lunch. Remember, if you pack it in, pack it out. Come prepared to have a great time!",
