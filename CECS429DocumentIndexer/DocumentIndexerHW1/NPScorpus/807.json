Depending on which trail segment you would like to explore, some or all of these activities may be available.  Although the word \"trail\" is used in the name, the Pony Express NHT is not a true hiking trail. With 1,800 miles of the original route now in the hands of various private and public entities, access to trail segments depends upon the permission of the land owner. Some segments are open to the public for hiking and other means of recreation, while others are not.  Following is a list of recommended activities for the Pony Express NHT. Inquiries about segments not listed are best made locally. See the Links and Resources, the Trail Sites and Auto Tour Route driving directions pages for more information.  Camping  The National Park Service does not offer any camping facilities along the trail. Inquire locally (see Links and Resources page).
