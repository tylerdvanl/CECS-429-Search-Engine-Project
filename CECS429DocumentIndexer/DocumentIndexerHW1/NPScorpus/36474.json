    "body": "Splendid Isolation, the Big Bend...  There is a place in Far West Texas where night skies are dark as coal and rivers carve temple-like canyons in ancient limestone. Here, at the end of the road, hundreds of bird species take refuge in a solitary mountain range surrounded by weather-beaten desert. Tenacious cactus bloom in sublime southwestern sun, and diversity of species is the best in the country. This magical place is Big Bend.              Discover the Chisos Mountains   Rising nearly a mile above the desert floor, the Chisos Mountains offer cooler temperatures for backcountry camping during the summer.",
