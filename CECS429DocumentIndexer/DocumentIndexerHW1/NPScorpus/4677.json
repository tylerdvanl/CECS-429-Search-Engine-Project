Rushes, sedges and grasses all look similar.  But upon closer inspection, there are differences.  Sedges usually have a triangular stem (sedges have edges), rushes have round stems and grasses usually have a flattened stem. One invasive non-native grass, Japanese Wiregrass or Stiltgrass(Microstegium vimineum) has spread rapidly during the last two decades and forms a dense carpet over approximately 50% of the forest floor.  Native sedges also can be found in the park, forming dense carpets along the forest floor.",
