Pets are allowed in Gallo Campground, but must be on a leash at all times and under control.  Pets are allowed on the backcountry hiking trails (Pueblo Alto, Peñasco Blanco, South Mesa, and Wijiji trails) as long as they remain on a leash that is no longer than 6 feet. Pets are not allowed within the archeological sites. Please carry out all pet waste and keep pets under control at all times. Bubonic plague and Hantavirus exist in northern New Mexico and rodents are the most common carriers. Keep yourself and your pets away from their burrows and nests as a reasonable precaution. Do not feed wildlife. Pets are not permitted to accompany you into the principal Chacoan sites (Pueblo Bonito, Chetro Ketl, Casa Rinconada, Pueblo del Arroyo, Hungo Pavi, and Una Vida) located along the Canyon Loop Drive.  Please do not leave pets alone in locked vehicles. Even in the winter temperatures in vehicles can soar and their lives can be endangered. Help the park continue to be a welcoming place for pets. Please care for your pets, help preserve the cultural remains, protect the wildlife, and respect your fellow visitors by following these policies.       Don't let this be your pet.",
