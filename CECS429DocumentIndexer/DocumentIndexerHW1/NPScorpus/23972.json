This area has restrooms, drinking fountains, and a limited snack bar. Food purchased in the underground snackbar must be consumed there. Please keep in mind that in order to protect the cave and the wildlife - any consumption of food and drink, except plain, unflavored water, is prohibited in any cave except in the underground snackbar in Carlsbad Cavern. Diabetics and persons with other medical conditions requiring them to eat or drink while in the cave are permitted on a limited basis. Food use has the potential for cave contamination, increased litter, and increased animal attraction into cave areas not usually frequented by wildlife. If you brought food with you, picnic tables are located at the east end of the visitor center parking lot and at Rattlesnake Springs Picnic Area, about 15 miles from the visitor center. Please check with a park ranger for fire restrictions before using a grill or camp stove. Outside of the park, dining is available 7 miles from the visitor center in White's City or in the town of Carlsbad about 30 minutes away.
