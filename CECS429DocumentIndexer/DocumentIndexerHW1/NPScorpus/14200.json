Christopher Talbot       We value your safety. There are many manageable hazards that you will encounter when visiting El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail. Here are a few to consider as you plan your visit.   Uneven Terrain: Many trails, roads, and sites have uneven terrain that can lead to tripping hazards and other obstacles. Wear appropriate footwear and make sure your tires are in good condition and your vehicle is appropriate for the road surface.    Weather: Many sites along the trail are in remote locations, or you may find yourself out in the elements enjoying a new location. Weather can change rapidly. Bring appropriate clothing layers, sunscreen, a hat, and any other items to protect you from the elements. Check the weather before you go.   Altitude: Visitors accustomed to sea level may find traveling through high elevation areas can cause breathing difficulty and fatigue. The sun burns more quickly at high elevations sites; wear sunscreen, and a hat to protect yourself from the heat and sunburn.    Remote areas: Many trail sites occur in very remote areas, far from gas, restrooms, cell service, food, or lodging. Plan your trip in advance carefully to avoid any mishaps related to lack of services. Carry a first aid kit.    Distance: Visitors accustomed to driving on paved highway roads may not realize how much slower unpaved or winding roads may be. Be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to get to your destinations based on the road surface you will be driving on.    Have a safe and enjoyable visit!",
