NPS\/Melissa Sladek       Internships The Crown of the Continent Research Learning Center (CCRLC) periodically enlists the help of student interns from around the world to assist with various research and education projects. These internships typically run approximately 12 weeks through the summer field season (June-August). Most interns work closely with our Citizen Science program, but we also offer internships in science communication, curriculum development, and sustainability when funding and projects arise. We typically offer two to three internships each summer. Depending on funding, some positions are paid; otherwise positions are on a volunteer basis with free housing provided. To learn about current openings and to sign up for the CCRLC's internship mailing list, e-mail us. Provide your name, contact information, level of education, field of study, institution attending, and dates of availability. Interns for the upcoming summer will be selected by early April. Occasionally, we can accommodate a winter intern to assist with data management and development of educational products. Housing is provided, free of charge, but positions are typically unpaid. Applications (resume, cover letter, and letter of recommendation) for a winter internship should be submitted at least three months before your proposed start date.   Jerry O'Neal National Park Service Student Fellowship The Crown of the Continent Research Learning Center, in collaboration with the Rocky Mountain CESU, created the Jerry O’Neal NPS student fellowship to support research in Glacier National Park, Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site, and Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument. Applicants must be a student from a Rocky Mountain CESU member college or university. More information about the fellowship can be found in the Jerry O'Neal Student Fellowship Brochure.  Jerry O’Neal was a former deputy superintendent of Glacier National Park who was actively engaged in a range of environmental management projects and was a key park official during the wildfires of 2003. Jerry was a scientist, poet, and writer. He had a deep love of nature, and was an outspoken proponent for using sound science to support resource management decisions. The fellowship aims to provide educational assistance for students seeking to understand natural and cultural resource issues and how these intersect with human values at Glacier National Park, Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site, or Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument. Watch for the next call for applications to be posted in November. Information on the Jerry O'Neal Fellowship, eligibility requirements and application procedures will be similar to those found in last year's call. Applications are normally due mid-February. For 2016 they must be postmarked by February 18. For details, see the 2016 Jerry O'Neal Fellowship Announcement.",
