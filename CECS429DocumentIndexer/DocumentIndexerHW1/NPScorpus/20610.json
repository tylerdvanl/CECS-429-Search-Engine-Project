The Spanish were the first Europeans known to have explored the Chesapeake Bay, and in 1592 cartographer Diego Gutierrez recorded the Chesapeake on a map, calling it \"Bahia de Santa Maria.\" In 1585, John White, part of the English expedition to the North Carolina coast of North America, drew a map of the Carolina coastline. White's map shows major bodies of water in the region, including the unnamed Chesapeake Bay, the Albemarle and Pamlico sounds, and the York and James rivers. Importantly, White's map also shows the locations of America Indian settlements.    More than 20 years ahead of John Smith, John White traveled to North America as the artist and cartographer for the first Virginia colony, which was actually located at today's Roanoke Island, North Carolina. White went at least twice to the Carolina coast in the 1580's and in 1587 he was governor of the ill-fated \"Lost Colony.\" In addition to his maps, White produced drawings and watercolors of everyday life of the Native Americans and of the flora and fauna of the Carolina coast. White's illustrations provide the most important documentation of 16th-century life in the region.        The 1585 map published by John White and Thomas Harriot as “La Virginea Pars,” is now in the British Museum.   White revised his original 1585 map by adding names and coastal detail gained from trips to the region in 1587 and 1588. His 1590 version of the map (below) first published with Thomas Harriot in A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia, was widely distributed in Theodore DeBry's Great Voyages, printed in French, English and German.         This John White map, published by Theodore DeBry in 1590, was the first printed map with detail for any part of the United States and the first separate map of Virginia. In this version, the Chesapeake Bay appears named for the first time and the map's orientation has changed to show west at the top.      Captain John Smith's Maps of the Chesapeake   In 1608, Smith made a rough sketched map of the Chesapeake Bay, which he sent to England ahead of his return in 1609. It fell into Spanish hands in England and was published by Don Pedro de Zuñiga. Known as the \"Zuñiga map,\" it documents Indian settlements and includes travels to the south and west in search of the Lost Colony of Roanoke.         The Zuñiga map is believed to have been drawn by Captain John Smith and sent to England in 1608 while Smith was still at Jamestown.   Captain John Smith's 1612 map was first published in London and separately in Oxford, England in conjunction with A Map of Virginia: with a Description of the Countrey, the Commodities, People, Government and Religion. The map, with slight variations, appeared in other works by Smith and by other commentators on Virginia over the next several years. Learn more about variations in Smith's maps. Smith's 1612 map was the most detailed map of Virginia and the Chesapeake region for the next 60 years, until the publication of Augustine Herman's map of Virigina and Maryland in 1673. Altered reproductions of Smith's 1612 map stayed in print for most of the 17th and 18th centuries. His map influenced colonication of the region for nearly a century and, together with his journals, provide the most comprehensive descriptions of the native populations and environment of the Chesapeake Bay of the period - a benchmark for comparisons between then and now.         Smith’s 1612 map is oriented with west at the top. This map, remarkable in detail and accuracy for its day, remains the most significant visual document of 17th-century Chesapeake.
