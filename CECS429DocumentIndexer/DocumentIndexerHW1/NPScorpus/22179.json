Kennecott Mines National Historic Landmark is located approximately seven - eight hours (by car) from Anchorage. From Anchorage, visitors must drive east on the Glenn Highway (Hwy 1), then south on the Richardson Highway (Hwy 4), then east on the Edgerton Highway (Hwy 10), then continue east on the McCarthy Road. The McCarthy Road is a narrow, gravel road that is 59 miles long. The town of McCarthy is located at the end of the McCarthy Road. All visitors must park their vehicles at the Kennicott River footbridge. There is no vehicle access to Kennecott Mill town, which is located 5 miles away from McCarthy. During the summer, there is a private shuttle that transports visitors between McCarthy and Kennecott for a fee of $5 one way. During the winter, the only access to Kennecott is by hiking or skiing the 5 miles from the end of the McCarthy Road. The shuttle does not operate during the winter. The McCarthy Road is technically open during the winter but it is not maintained regularly. There are no services available in McCarthy or Kennecott during the winter. Since the McCarthy Road is a gravel road, most rental car companies do not allow their cars on this road. Please check with your rental company to find out their regulations. The McCarthy Road is NOT owned by the National Park Service. It is owned and operated by the State of Alaska. You can find out more about the McCarthy Road and rental car options on the Driving Park Roads page. If you don't want to drive, there are other options. There are two companies that provide a daily shuttle to Kennecott\/McCarthy during the summer and Wrangell Mountain Air provides daily flights from Chitina during the summer.",
