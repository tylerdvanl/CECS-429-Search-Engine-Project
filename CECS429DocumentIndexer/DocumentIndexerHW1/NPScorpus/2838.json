The quiet, stark beauty of the Mojave Desert, with its dramatically exposed geology and the surprising abundance of specially adapted plant and animals, offers a variety of experiences for everyone. Lake Mead National Recreation Area is a startling contrast of desert and water, mountains and canyons, primitive backcountry and busy marinas. Dams that back up the Colorado River as it flows through one of the hottest, driest regions on earth created Lake Mead and Lake Mohave. Established as America's first national recreation area, it is a destination for millions of visitors who flock to the desert for boating, fishing, swimming and water-skiing.",
