Serving as a park volunteer will provide a very important service to our park area, our community, and our nation. The ability to improve visitor experiences depends greatly on the successful recruitment of volunteers to augment the core of highly professional and dedicated National Park Service staff. Our volunteers work in our Interpretation and Visitor Services division assisting with visitor center operations, guided house tours and special events, our Curatorial division assisting with museum object care, and our Natural Resource Management division assisiting with ranch work. If you are interested in becoming a volunteer, please contact the park volunteer coordinator.         A summer interpretive volunteer is teaching children how to read brands by playing brand bingo. This is one of many summer programs our volunteers can do.         Park volunteers help out caring for our 36,000 museum objects and organizing the park research library and historic archives.           Our summer interpretive volunteers have the opportunity to present interpretation programs at the chuckwagon or cowboy talks with our horses.         Local volunteers help rope calves for branding during our Western Heritage Days Weekend event.         Volunteers from throughout the state bring their teams of draft horses to help with historic haying demonstrations.       Current Volunteer Opportunities",
