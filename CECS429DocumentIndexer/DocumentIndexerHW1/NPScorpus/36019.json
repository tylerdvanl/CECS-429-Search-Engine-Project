Nearly a dozen species of acacia can be found in the area. However, the difference between a \"tree\" and \"shrub\" is difficult to define around Amistad. The size of many species of woody plants depends greatly on the local availability of water and the age of the plant. Mesquite trees grow to more than 20 feet in some areas, but elsewhere are stunted to only a few feet.",
