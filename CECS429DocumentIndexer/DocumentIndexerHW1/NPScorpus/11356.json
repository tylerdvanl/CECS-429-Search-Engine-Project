Today it is operated, along with the neighboring Pierce-Hitchborn House, as a house museum by the Paul Revere Memorial Association, which restored the dwelling in 1908 after it had been used for a number of different purposes, including a cigar factory and bank.  The Paul Revere Memorial Association, a private, non-profit organization, operates both the Paul Revere and Pierce\/Hitchborn Houses.  Hours: For more information visit the Paul Revere House.
