    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Directions & Transportation             Directions         Tuzigoot as seen from the banks of the Verde River in Southeast corner of the Monument   Tuzigoot National Monument is 52 miles south of Flagstaff, Arizona via U.S. Alternate Highway 89A, or 90 miles north of Phoenix. Travel Interstate Highway 17, take Exit 287 and travel west on Highway 260 to Cottonwood. You will continue through Cottonwood on Hwy 89A and go toward Clarkdale. At the first traffic light after turning on to 89A, signs will direct you to turn left to stay on 89A. Go straight through this intersection. This will put you on HISTORIC 89A (designated on the map above as HWY 260) and take you through “Old Town Cottonwood”. As you can tell from the map, Main Street (Historic 89A) does a lot of twisting around. Once you leave Cottonwood you are almost there. There will be a sign telling you where to turn to get to Tuzigoot. You take Tuzigoot Road and follow it to the end…that is where Tuzigoot National Monument is. Enjoy the trip.      Please follow the directions above and do NOT use a GPS. Most systems are based on an old map including a road through Dead Horse Ranch State Park which does not exist today. We are working with GPS providers to update maps and encourage you to download updates for your system. Until then, use a good ol' map and the directions above.",
