Schools, elder hostels, and other educational groups are welcome to either make a reservation for a ranger-led program or to drop in and see the museum. Making Reservations We require that you make a reservation at least two weeks ahead of your visit. Programs are available throughout the school year at 10:00 am and 12:30 pm. Please refer to the 'ranger guided tour link' for the programs that are available.  May is the busiest month of the year for field trips. If you can come at another time, we are happy to accommodate your group. If May is the only time that you can come, please call early. Slots for the spring fill up quickly!!! If you would like to either make a reservation or if you have any questions, please contact the park staff at (208) 843-7001 Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. You can also make a request through e-mail. Please note: It is difficult for the park to accommodate groups over thirty on Monday's due to staffing. If this is the only day available to pay a visit, the staff we try and fit the group into the schedule. Chaperones Please instruct the chaperones to remain with their groups throughout the ranger's program. Teachers and chaperones are responsible for insuring that the group follows the rules that are set by the Ranger. The staff would like the chaperones to participate in the tour with the children. Timeliness We appreciate that your group is considering taking some time to schedule a visit to the park. Given the distances that many groups have to travel, the staff is flexible in accommodating unexpected problems. Please note: Groups arriving more than 15 minutes after their designated arrival time will have their planned activities adjusted or eliminated to meet the demands of the schedule. Please understand that this rule is in place to ensure that your group has a quality educational experience. Accessibility The visitor center, museum, and restrooms are accessible. There are curb cutouts in the entry drive in front of the visitor center. The museum and theater are located on one floor. The park film, Nez Perce: Portrait of a People is open captioned for the hearing impaired. Lunch In the spring and early fall, many classes eat their lunches in the picnic area located below the visitor center. In inclement weather, classes can eat on the patio. Whether at the picnic area or on the patio, please take the time to recycle. Recycling containers are found throughout the Spalding site. Please Note: The park does not have either vending machines or a cafe. Any food or beverages you want to consume, you must bring with you.",
