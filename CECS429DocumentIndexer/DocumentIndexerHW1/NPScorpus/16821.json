    "body": "Distance Learning Opportunities          Just because you can't visit Death Valley National Park doesn't mean your students can't experience it! If your classroom is in eastern California or southern Nevada, you can invite a ranger into your classroom as a guest speaker. Students further abroad can explore the history and culture of the park through our Virtual Museum Collection. Teachers can enhance this experience by using our Teaching with Museum Collections lesson plans.",
