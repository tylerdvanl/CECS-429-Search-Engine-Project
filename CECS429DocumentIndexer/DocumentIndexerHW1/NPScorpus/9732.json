At Lowell National Historical Park, we honor the connections between past and present. At the Banjo &Fiddle Contest, we invite you to come celebrate musical heritage. The repertoire of tunes played during the Contest is what Folklorists refer to as traditional musicâ€”music practiced by groups of people who share a common ethnic heritage, geographic region, or way of life. Tunes are shared within families and communities and are passed on over generations. Come for the fiddles, stay for the fun! We'll have jam sessions and music workshops 10AM-noon, and then a whole afternoon full of music and community.
