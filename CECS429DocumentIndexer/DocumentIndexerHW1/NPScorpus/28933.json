National Park service  Interpretive planning determines appropriate interpretive services, facilities, programs, and media to communicate in the most effective way the park's purpose, significance, compelling stories, themes and values, while protecting and preserving park resources. Sound interpretive planning defines desirable and diverse experiences, recommends ways to facilitate those experiences, and assures they are accessible. The outcome of interpretive planning is effectiveness in communicating the park's story in a larger context, ideas, meanings, and the values associated with the resources themselves, and achieving the balance between resource protection and visitor use and enjoyment.
