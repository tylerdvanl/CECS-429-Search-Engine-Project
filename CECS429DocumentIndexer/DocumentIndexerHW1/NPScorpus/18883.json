    "body": "Learning From Fossils Fossils have so much to teach us if we only knew how to understand them. That's where paleontologists come in! With their help we can learn what life was like here at Hagerman millions of years ago. We can discover the plants and animals that lived before us and gain knowledge about how life changes through time.                 Have fossils, will travel! No time to come and see the fossils?
