Further Information TENNESSEE  Individuals in possession of a valid Tennessee handgun carry permit are authorized to carry in Fort Donelson National Battlefield  The permit holder shall have the permit in the holder’s immediate possession at all times when carrying a handgun and shall display the permit on demand of a law enforcement officer.   CARRY OF SHOTGUNS AND RIFLES  The possession of long guns, specifically shotguns and rifles, will only be in accordance with TN § 39-17-1307(e) which specifically states that a person authorized to carry a handgun pursuant to § 39-17-1351 may transport a rifle or shotgun in or on a privately-owned motor vehicle, and the rifle or shotgun may not have ammunition in the chamber.  Open carry of a shotgun or rifle off a private individual’s property or out of their home, would only be for the purposes of hunting.   Hunting is prohibited within the boundaries of Fort Donelson National Battlefield, so the possession of openly carried shotguns or rifles would be in violation of Tennessee state law.    RECIPROCITY  Tennessee recognizes a facially valid handgun permit, firearms permit, weapons permit, or a license issued by another state according to its terms, and will, therefore, authorize the holder of such out-of-state permit or license to carry a handgun in the state of Tennessee.  This means that the state of Tennessee will recognize any state’s valid permit or license, even if Tennessee does not have a written reciprocity agreement with that state, and even if that state does not recognize a Tennessee permit.  Individuals must be in possession of the permit or license at all times such person carries a handgun in Tennessee.  Kentucky  Individuals in possession of a valid Kentucky handgun carry permit are authorized to carry in the Fort Heiman, Kentucky Unit of Fort Donelson National Battlefield  In Kentucky visitors will be able to openly carry firearms on trails, in campgrounds, or any other area that is not specifically prohibited. Persons with valid concealed weapons permits may carry concealed weapons in these areas also.  There are no state laws restricting how long weapons (rifles and shotguns) may be carried in vehicles. State law does state that handguns carried in the passenger compartment of a vehicle must be stored in the glove compartment. The glove compartment need not be locked. Persons with a valid concealed weapons permit may carry their weapon on their person while in a vehicle.  Individuals must be in possession of the permit or license at all times such person carries a handgun in Kentucky.  RECIEPROCITY  Kentucky provides for reciprocity of concealed carry permits from states that recognize Kentucky permits. For a listing see the website listed below. For firearms regulations in the Fort Heiman Unit in Kentucky:  http:\/\/www.kentuckystatepolice.org\/conceal.htm Federal Laws Laws are created by Congress and establish the highest order of legal authority over national parks.   Many laws, including the 1916 Organic Act that created the National Park Service, affect all areas managed by the National Park Service.   Fort Donelson's enabling legislation provides specific instructions and guidance on how thepark must be managed.   NPS Policies Service-wide policy for the National Park Service is developed by the Office of Policy with public input and in accordance with applicable laws. Policies dictate many of the overall directions and procedures used by all parks.
