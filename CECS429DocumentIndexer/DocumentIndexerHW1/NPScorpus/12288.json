    "body": "Scuba Diving       Isle Royale offers exciting scuba diving opportunities. Here the cold waters of Lake Superior maintain a variety of shipwrecks in outstanding condition for exploration and photography. These sunken vessels are protected by the National Park Service as cultural treasures to be enjoyed by you, the experienced scuba diver. In order to preserve fragile natural and cultural resources, areas such as the inland lakes, all land-associated underwater cultural sites, and the Passage Island small boat cove are closed to diving.  Weather  Lake Superior’s rough weather is well-known. Follow forecasts given regularly over marine radio and keep a least one person aboard your boat whenever divers are in the water.        Diver explores the bow of the shipwreck, America.   Temperature  Water is cold at all times. At the surface, water temperature rarely reaches 55 degrees Fahrenheit. Below 50 feet, divers can expect 34-37 degrees Fahrenheit temperatures. Protect yourself; a full wet suit is necessary and a dry suit is recommended.  Air Tanks  There are no facilities for filling dive cylinders at Isle Royale. Personal compressor use is limited to designated locations and times. Once at Isle Royale, your dive permit lists regulations on compressor use.  Exploring Shipwrecks  Divers on shipwrecks can become lost in a maze of confined passages or entangled in debris, wire, and line. Darkness and silt found within wrecks can reduce visibility to zero. We recommend proper training and equipment for diving the wrecks found within the cold and often deep waters of Lake Superior.           Diver decompresses.   Decompression  Cold, dark surroundings and excitement increase the possibility of a decompression problem. Do not push the standard sport or recreational dive tables.  Divers at Isle Royale should dive within the “no-decompression” limits. Deep dives require specific equipment and experience. Divers not so equipped or experienced for depths below 100 feet should not attempt such dives. Illness Diving-related illnesses, especially those requiring a recompression chamber, pose a severe threat to the life of any diver. The closest recompression chamber is in Marquette, Michigan. Diving parties should be knowledgeable in CPR and emergency procedures for accidents. Carry an adequate first-aid kit including an oxygen delivery system and know how to use them.      Emergencies  Toll free: 1-800-433-1986 Via Satellite Phonefrom Canada: (440) 546-5945  At the first indication of a diving illness, contact a ranger on marine radio (channel 16) at Rock Harbor or Windigo, or in person. Do not wait to confirm that there is a problem. Isle Royale National Park maintains procedures for the treatment and evacuation of accident victims. An National Park Service diving team can be activated for search and rescue operations. Invasive Species Invasive species are considered to be one of the top threats to the ecological integrity of our national parks.  Please take the time before and during your trip to do your part to repel the invasion. Wash all dive gear in warm chlorinated tap water.  Disinfect your wetsuit with a special-purpose shampoo.  Dry all dive gear and wetsuit for seven days before island departure. Read more about invasive species at Isle Royale National Park and what you can do to help stop the spread.

Report all scuba related accidents, near accidents, hazardous diving situations, or unusual observations to a park ranger as soon as possible. Your suggestions concerning the management of underwater cultural resources are encouraged.

Diving Regulations Registration Divers must register at the Rock Harbor, Windigo, or Houghton visitor centers before diving, and return your completed copy of the registration form to a visitor center or by mail.  Your diving registration helps us manage underwater sites.  Canadian vessels and divers must clear customs when they enter the park. Artifacts Occasionally you may discover artifacts of high quality and value.  Report these to a park ranger as soon as possible.  Please do not remove the artifacts.       Shipwreck Conservation Shipwrecks are part of the park's cultural resources.Help us to preserve them.  Federal law prohibits the removal, or disturbance in any manner of underwater cultural sites and associated artifacts.  This includes shipwrecks or remains of ships, as well as other antiquities on the bottom lands of waters in Isle Royale National Park.  Penalties include prison sentences and fines up to $10,000.  Rewards up to $500 may be paid to anyone who furnishes information that leads to conviction of a criminal violation. Dive Flag Dive sites or boats must be marked with the standard diver down flag (red with white diagonal strip, minimum 12 inches by 12 inches) whenever divers are in the water.  When at the surface divers must be within 100 feet of the flag.  The flag must be illuminated when diver operations take place between sunset and sunrise.      Moorings  Nine shipwreck sites are buoyed to provide a safe mooring and protect the wrecks from anchor\/ tie-off damage. These secure moorings are marked by a white buoy with a blue stripe. Mooring buoys are to be used only by registered divers during actual dive operations. No more than two dive boats may use a mooring at any given time. When a mooring is provided, do not tie off or anchor. When no mooring is provided, use a diver to tie-off to a stable piece of wreckage. Do not anchor in a wreck.          Algoma at dock.
