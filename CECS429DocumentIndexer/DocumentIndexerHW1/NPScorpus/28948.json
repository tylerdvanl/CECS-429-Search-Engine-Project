The need for current, factual, balanced historical research is, of course, essential to the preservation of the physical resources of the site. It is even more important to the understanding and interpretion of President Van Buren and the ante bellum period of American history.

Much of the research is arranged through the National Park Service's agreement with the Organization of American Historians.
