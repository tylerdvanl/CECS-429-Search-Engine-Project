On the Mumma, Roulette, Pry and Miller farms, the springs are covered by either by a stone or concrete springhouse.Water may also sporadically emerge in fields, woods or rock outcrops. Not being contained by a springhouse, springs will naturally continue on as a stream. These streams are intermittent, meaning they are only present certain times of the year, if at all.",
