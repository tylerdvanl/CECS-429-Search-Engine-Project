    "body": "Laws & Policies        To Protect Visitors and Resources: Policies and Regulations There are a variety of documents that guide the management of Andersonville National Historic Site. Many documents, like the National Environmental Policy Act, articulate legal requirements to which federal entities must adhere. Other documents, like the park's General Management Plan and Superintendent's Compendium, are formal documents that create a \"contract\" between the park and the public. Still others, like Director's and Superintendent Orders, direct how Andersonville and other national park units will operate.   The information available in this section will allow you to become more aware of park implementation plans and of how park operations are structured toward success in achieving the NPS mission of preserving unimpaired park resources for the enjoyment of future generations. These pages also include specific regulations on a variety of activities within the park.
