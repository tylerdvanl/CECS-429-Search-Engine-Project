Are you interested in exploring? Do you like history or nature? Would you like to learn more about the national parks that belong to you? Did you know you can help protect these special places? You could be our next Junior Ranger! Junior Ranger Programs are designed to provide participants with the flexibility to see and interact with the park at their own pace and within the limits of their own time. National Parks with Junior Ranger Programs: Many National Parks offer visitors the opportunity to join the National Park Service Family as Junior Rangers. Interested students complete a series of activities during their park visit, share their answers with a park ranger, and receive an official Moores Creek National Battlefield Junior Ranger badge and patch.  Â      Matthew Woods, Education Specialist, talks to Boy Scouts about patch programs. Douglas Prouty Volunteer  Scouts (BSA and GSA) Moores Creek National Battlefield offers numerous opportunities for local Scouts to earn badges, camp out, and volunteer their time in a meaningful way. Historically, over 2,000 Boy and Girl Scouts visit the park each year, with that number growing each year. Scouts can camp in a large group setting in the park's Patriots Field, or in a small group setting at the park's new community campsite, Camp Caswell, which consists of 20 tent sites, 3 fire pits, and several grills and picnic tables. Bathrooms and running water are nearby. The park offers numerous ways to volunteer and serve the park. Scouts can assist with any of the numerous Special Events that are held each year, including the park's Anniversary, which received nearly 7,000 visitors over the course of that weekend. Other opportunities can be found in clearing trails, splitting wood, or completing service projects such as building benches or painting benches. When a Scout group serves at least five hours in a volunteer status in our park, they will qualify for the National Park Service Resource Stewardship Scout Ranger Patch. This is a National program.
