Loomis photographs of the Lassen Peak eruptions and aftermath are among the most famous images of Lassen Volcanic National Park (LAVO).  These photographs are more widely used than any other LAVO photographs and copies of them are present in many collections throughout the archives.  The B.F. Loomis Photograph Collection includes all of Loomis’ surviving glass plate negatives, as well as original prints and copy prints.   Biographical Note:   Benjamin Franklin (B.F.) Loomis was one of the first and most significant of Lassen Volcanic National Park’s benefactors.  His donation of land around Manzanita Lake ensured the ongoing preservation of important natural features, and his legacy of photographs of Lassen Peak in eruption have enriched the public’s appreciation and understanding of the Lassen region.   B.F. Loomis was born on March 21st, 1857 in Mantega, Illinois, to Addison and Emily Loomis.  As a small boy, Loomis traveled west with his parents and older brother, Orin Augustus, across the plains in a covered wagon.  They settled in Tehama County, California.  When B.F was nine, Emily Loomis died, and his father moved the family (now including sister Lucy Ella) to Red Bluff, CA.   In 1874, Loomis came to Manzanita Lake and built a small cabin.  He made his living making and selling wood shakes in the summer, and working as a farm laborer in Battle Creek Bottoms during the winter.  In 1886, Loomis attended the American Institute of Phrenology in New York City, and also took classes in anatomy, physiology, astronomy, and astrology.  This was primarily for his own edification; he had no plans to become a practitioner or lecturer, though he studied and wrote on the topic for many years.   Following his studies, Loomis returned to California and to shake-making in the Manzanita Lake area.  In 1888, he filed a homestead claim on Bailey Creek (present-day Viola), moved to his homestead in 1891, and built a general store in 1895.   In 1897, while serving on a jury in Redding, Loomis met fellow jurist Leander Vaness (L.V.) Loomis (1827-1909), an emigrant pioneer of Shasta County (and no relation to B.F. Loomis).  The two men shared an interest in phrenology and astronomy, so Loomis spent the trial recess at the L.V. Loomis family home.  Here, Loomis was introduced to L.V. Loomis’ daughter, Estella (1870-1953).  B.F. and Estella Loomis were married on September 1, 1897.  Their only child, Louisa Mae, was born June 16, 1899.   While Estella ran the Viola store and post office, Loomis transported freight to Viola and shakes to the Sacramento Valley.  In 1910, Loomis bought the Vilas Mill and began a large-scale lumber business with the considerable timber lands that he had acquired.  Loomis also owned and ran the Viola Hotel in Viola, CA, originally located in Shingletown but relocated by Loomis.   Loomis bought his first camera in 1898 from Estella’s brother Arthur, who was a commercial photographer in Redding.  When Lassen Peak began to erupt in 1914, Loomis was among the first photographers to capture images of the event. His photographs and written accounts of the eruptions provide some of the best documentation of the 1914 and 1915 volcanic activity.  Widely disseminated at the time in the press, Loomis later published many of his photographs in his book, Pictorial History of the Lassen Volcano.    Loomis was a strong and active advocate for the formation of Lassen Volcanic National Park, and worked hard to stimulate public interest in the natural wonders of the region.  When Loomis’ daughter Louisa Mae died after a brief, unidentified illness at age 20, he built the Louisa Mae Loomis Memorial Museum at Manzanita Lake to house and showcase a substantial collection of photographs and artifacts for the public.  Loomis deeded the museum, seismograph station, and surrounding 40 acres to Lassen Volcanic National Park in 1929.    When Loomis retired from business in Viola, he and Estella established a summer residence and art shop next to the museum at Manzanita Lake.  B.F. Loomis died of cancer in 1935; Estella continued to live in the area until her death in 1953.   Scope and Content:   The B.F. Loomis Photograph Collection contains images of the Lassen Peak eruptions and aftermath, natural and man made features in the region, Loomis’ lumbering business, and the Loomis family.  The collection contains most of the photographs that appear in Loomis’ book, Pictorial History of the Lassen Volcano.   This collection contains Loomis’ original glass plate negatives.    Note on Arrangement:   The collection is divided into four series:   Series 1: Lassen Peak eruptions and aftermath, and other regional images Series 2: Loomis lumbering business Series 3: Loomis family photographs Series 4: Other photographs from Pictorial History of Lassen Volcano   Alternate Forms Available:   Digital prints made from scans of the glass plate negatives are available for reference.    Terms of Use and Access:   The collection is open to the public.  Contact the park for information regarding reproduction or publication.   Glass plate negatives are not available for use.  Reproduction requests may be filled using scans.   Acquisition Information:   The B.F. Loomis Photograph collection was donated to the park by B.F. and Estella Loomis in multiple gifts over the years.  Accession information is in the collection case files.   Related Material:   The LAVO Administrative Records contain some B.F. Loomis papers.    Bibliography:   Loomis, B.F.  Pictorial History of the Lassen Volcano.  Loomis Museum Association, published in cooperation with the     National Park Service, Mineral: 1926.    Processing Note:   Prints in the B.F. Loomis Photographs for which there are no negatives include original prints and copy prints; sometimes a modern copy print is the only extant object for an image.      Over the years, numerous copy prints of the Loomis images were made, most often from a copy negative that was in turn made from a copy print.  As these secondary and tertiary copies were made, image quality fell and information within the image was lost.  The copy prints were probably made by park staff for reference, exhibits, or to fill other reproduction requests, and are not original materials from the collection.  All superfluous, inferior copy prints of Loomis images have now been removed from the LAVO photograph archives.   Reproduction requests for Loomis images should be filled using images from PH Coll 1, the B.F. Loomis Photograph Collection.   The B.F. Loomis Photograph Collection also contains photographs not made by Loomis.  These include original and copy negatives of Lassen Peak eruption photographs made by other photographers, and studio portraits of family.   In 2005, LAVO obtained funding to make preservation prints and maximum resolution scans of all of Loomis’ glass plate negatives.  The project was completed in 2006.      INVENTORY   Series One: Lassen Peak eruptions and aftermath, and other regional images   Items 1-52 are glass plate negatives; prints are available for reference.

Known as the “Umbrella Cloud” picture, this image is probably a composite photograph, where the ash cloud was cut out of a different picture and pasted onto an image of Lassen Peak taken from Anderson.  The effect shows a dramatic yet probably false view of the eruption from Anderson.  Loomis’ glass plate negative of this image is a copy negative.
