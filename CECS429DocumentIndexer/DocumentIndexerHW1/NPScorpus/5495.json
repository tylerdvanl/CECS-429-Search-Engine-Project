Area National Parks Join Find Your Park Movement National Park Week 2015 Encourages Everyone To Find Your Park             WASHINGTON – National capital region parks join national parks, programs and partners across the country to encourage everyone to find their park and share their stories online at FindYourPark.com. To inspire area residents to find their park and to help engage a new generation of park stewards, area parks will offer fee free days on April 18 and 19. Several area parks will also offer special programs throughout National Park Week, which runs April 18-26, and on National Junior Ranger Day, April 18. “I encourage everyone to get out and explore area parks during National Park Week and ‘Find Your Park.’ National parks touch many of us in the greater Washington area on a daily basis, so I invite you to explore someplace new. Maybe a ranger-led hike at a historic Civil War fort or battlefield or a bike ride along the C&O Canal Towpath; have a picnic in a neighborhood park, or visit a national historic landmark,” National Capital Regional Director Bob Vogel said. “Get out and Find Your Park!” “Find Your Park” is the theme for this year’s National Park Week, April 18 – 26. To find special programs and activities near you during this year’s park week visit the national park week event calendar online. Launched March 30 by the National Park Service and the National Park Foundation, Find Your Park is a public awareness and education campaign celebrating the milestone centennial anniversary of the National Park Service in 2016 and setting the stage for its second century of service. \"Find Your Park\" invites the public to see that a national park can be more than a place -- it can be a feeling, a state of mind, or a sense of American pride. Beyond vast landscapes, the campaign highlights historical, urban and cultural parks, as well as the National Park Service programs that protect, preserve and share nature, culture, and history in communities nationwide. Visit www.NationalParkWeek.org to learn more about how you can join parks, programs, and partners in celebrating National Park Week across the country. www.nps.gov\/ncro About the National Park Service.
