    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Permits & Reservations     Special Use Permits                Special Use Permits       Special Use Permits A special use permit is required for activities that provide a benefit to an individual, group, or organization rather than the public at large and that require written authorization and management control in order to protect park resources and the public interest. Examples include: weddings, memorial services, commercial filming and\/or photography, special assemblies, First Amendment activities, athletic events, or collecting of resource materials. Each of these activities requires a special use permit that must be acquired in advance. Application Form  Weddings Mesa Verde's inspiring viewpoints and natural settings are ideally suited for small, informal weddings. All weddings, regardless of size, require an approved wedding permit issued by the National Park Service.  Application Form  First Amendment Activities  Freedom of speech, press, religion, and assembly are constitutional rights. However, the courts have recognized that activities associated with the exercise of these rights may be reasonably regulated to protect park resources. The necessity of a permit to conduct First Amendment activities is determined by the group size.   A small group is defined as \"25 people or less.\" A \"small group\" is not required to obtain a First Amendment Permit if they are located within a park designated First Amendment site and have no more than leaflets, booklets and\/or hand-held signs. A permit is required for any small group that:    a. wants to hold a demonstration or distribute and\/or sell printed matter somewhere outside a designated First Amendment area.   b. wants to use equipment (i.e., tables, banners, platforms, etc.) even if it is within a designated area.   c. is merely an extension of another group already availing itself of the 25 person maximum.   d. wants to guarantee they will have priority for the use of a location, including the designated First Amendment areas.      A large group is defined as more than \"25 people\" and is required to obtain a First Amendment Permit even if they are utilizing a park designated First Amendment site. Some examples of special events that fall under First Amendment Rules:  distribution and\/or sale of printed matter religious services public demonstrations or assemblies, etc.   There are no permit fees associated with First Amendment permits.
