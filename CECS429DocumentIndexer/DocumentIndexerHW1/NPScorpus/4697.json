His inspiring research included the beginnings of American biography with his collection of biographical information on the leaders of America.  His works included: The Writings of George Washington (1834-1838), The Library of American Biography (1834-1838), The Works of Benjamin Franklin (1836-1840), and as editor of the North American Review (1824-1831).
