    "body": "Historic Rim Rock Drive        Rim Rock Drive, Fruita Canyon NPS Lynne Mager   Â    Colorado National Monument's Rim Rock Drive is one of the most spectacular drives in the United States. Redrock canyons, crisp blue skies, and verdant green juniper splash fantastic views along the way for motorists and bicyclists. However, the road is challenging, narrow, and steep in some sections with sheer dropoffs. Special considerations must be made for road travel since motorists and bicyclists share the road. Use caution when on tight corners and hills. On the east side of the monument, motorists may encounter large trucks that use four miles of the monument's roadway to access the community of Glade Park. Please Follow These Rules:  Use your headlights in all tunnels and watch for bicyclists and other vehicles. Obey all traffic laws and speed limits. The maximum speed is 25 mph.  Do not attempt to proceed around bicyclists unless you have a clear view of oncoming traffic and a safe passing distance. Do not pass in the tunnels. When passing bicyclists, please allow at least three feet of clearance between your vehicle and the bicyclist. Check carefully for bicycles, pedestrians and vehicles before pulling out onto the road from pullouts. Allow other motorists and bicyclists to pass if you are obstructing traffic and there is a safe place to pull over. Remember that bicyclists have all the rights and responsibilities of any vehicle.",
