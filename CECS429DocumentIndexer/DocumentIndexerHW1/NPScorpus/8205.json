    "body": "Logan Pass         Monkey flowers at Logan Pass NPS\/Jacob W. Frank  At Logan Pass, Reynolds Mountain and Clements Mountain tower over fields of wildflowers that carpet the ground throughout the summer. Waves of yellow glacier lilies pushing up through the snow are quickly replaced by a variety of alpine plants adapted to this harsh, but spectacularly beautiful habitat. Mountain goats, bighorn sheep, and the occasional grizzly bear lumbering through the meadows offer spectacular wildlife viewing opportunities. Logan Pass is the highest elevation (6646ft\/2025m) reachable by car in the park. It is extremely popular with visitors and the parking lot is generally full between 11:00 am and 4:00 pm. Consider visiting this destination by using the free shuttles to avoid limited parking, or plan to visit early or late in the day if possible. Early morning light on the mountains provides excellent photographs and the chances to see wildlife are greater before the crowds arrive. Hiking two of the area's most popular trails, the Hidden Lake trail and the Highline trail, is the perfect way to build an appetite for a late supper back at camp or your hotel.         Super Squirrel Artist-in-Residence Myra Messick Simons  Super Powers Exhibit The subalpine ecosystem of Logan Pass is home to creatures with amazing abilities. They require special adaptations to survive at this elevation. It's almost like these animals have developed super powers.   Let exhibits outside Logan Pass Visitor Center teach you about how these animals live and how climate change may be making it more and more difficult for them.
