A total of approximately 704 acres will be surveyed for archeological resources. A second project component - the updating of records for previously documented archeological resources - will improve future resource planning and management, and will provide data for publications. For more information about this project, please contact Keith Lyons or Joshua Ramsey at 928-674-5500.",
