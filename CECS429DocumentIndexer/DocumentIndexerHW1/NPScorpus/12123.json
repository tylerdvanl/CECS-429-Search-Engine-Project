Most events and activities held within the park require a Special Use Permit. These permits are issued and approved only after National Park Service staff determines that the activity will not impair park values, resources, and visitor enjoyment. A Special Use Permit or Filming Permit is required for activities that provide a benefit to an individual, group, or organization, rather than the public at large, and for activities that require some degree of management by the National Park Service. Examples of activities include, but are not limited to: filming, cultural programs, workshops, events, runs, and cycling events. The goal of the park in issuing a permit is to ensure that the permitted activity does not interfere with the enjoyment of the park by other visitors and that the natural and cultural resources of the park are protected.      Permit Requirements A permit is required when an activity such as filming, videotaping, sound recording or still photography* involves any one of the below factors:  the use of talent, or professional crews, or set dressing, or props, when they involve product or service advertisement, when the activity could result in damage to park resources, creates a disturbance to visitor use,  *Still Photography does not require a permit if it involves only hand-held equipment (tripod, interchangeable lenses or flash), and does not involve any of the above factors. Media Breaking News - Is an event that cannot be covered at any other time or at any other location. Coverage of breaking news does not require a permit. Other Media - Frequently there are opportunities for news organizations to focus on park programs, or increase public awareness of park-specific issues. Filming related to these stories must be coordinated and planned in advance and do require a permit. School media projects, independent films, documentaries, interviews with former internees, and feature films require a film permit. Restrictions The National Park Service cannot accommodate a project if:  Damage to natural, cultural and recreational resources is expected which cannot be mitigated The activity involves access to areas normally closed for reasons of resource protection and safety The level of activity within the park is already so high that staff would be unavailable to work with film crews The project includes a portrayal of activities that are not permitted within a national park The production company is unwilling or unable to obtain necessary insurance, or comply with National Park Service bond requirements Prohibited Activities Altering, damaging or removing vegetation or cultural resources Vehicle use off established roads and parking areas Smoking in buildings, or in vegetated areas Digging, scraping, chiseling, or defacing natural or cultural features       Permit Application Procedures Please submit the appropriate below application(s).
