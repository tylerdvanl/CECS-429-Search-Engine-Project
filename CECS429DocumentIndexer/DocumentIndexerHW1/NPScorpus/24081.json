    "body": "Cell Phone Service       Over the years, cellular service in central New Mexico has improved so that coverage is available in most towns and along most major highways. However, expect to find areas without coverage throughout the region. The three units of Salinas Pueblo Missions continue to have poor  cellular service. Below is a rough summary of coverage in the park. However, for your own safety, please remember that:  This summary is not a guarantee of service. Under no circumstances should visitors rely on cellular service at any of the units of Salinas Pueblo Missions. Service may vary between carriers. Currently, Verizon seems to offer the widest coverage in the area. Texting is often a more effective means of communication in areas with limited service.     Mountainair Coverage is generally available in the town of Mountainair although it can be spotty inside the visitor center. Abo There is little to no coverage at the Abo unit. Quarai There may be some spotty coverage along the interpretive trail and the Spanish Corral Trail, but it is unreliable. Gran Quivira There is little to no coverage at the Gran Quivira unit.",
