    "body": "Trails, Barriers, and Closed Areas        Trails make it easy for visitors to travel to and through the Chaco structures, but most importantly, they restrict foot traffic to areas that can be safely visited and prevent damage to more fragile areas. Some sections of the buildings are so fragile that the only safe viewing (for visitors and for the masonry) is from a distance. Signs, rope or wooden barriers, and complete closures protect extremely precarious areas where conditions are unsafe and visitor use will cause long-term or irreparable damage.
