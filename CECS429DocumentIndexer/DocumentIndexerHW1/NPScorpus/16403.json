Smoke may be visible from ongoing fires during the fire season, typically mid-June through September. NPS       Fire has been a key factor in shaping the ecology of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Native plant species evolved adaptations so they survive and in some cases flourish after periodic fires. Fire influences ecosystem processes and patterns, such as nutrient cycling and plant community composition and structure. Fire regimes in the western United States changed with the arrival of European and American settlers, whose livestock removed grassy fuels that carried fires and whose roads fragmented the continuity of fire-carrying fuels. Most naturally occurring fires were suppressed to the extent possible. The National Park Service aims to restore fire's role as a natural process in parks when and where this is feasible.  Lightning may ignite dozens of forest fires during a single summer, but most of them go out naturally after burning less than half an acre. Others torch isolated or small groups of trees, become smoldering ground fires, and eventually go out on their own. On rare occasions, wind-driven fires have burned through large areas of forest, as in 1988, when multiple fires crossed more than one million acres in Yellowstone and on surrounding federal lands despite massive efforts to extinguish them. Without frequent small and occasional large fires to create a mosaic of plant communities in different growth stages, biodiversity declines and leaf litter and deadfall accumulate much faster than they can return nutrients to the soil through decay.  Evidence of fires that burned before the park was established in 1872 can be found in soil profiles, charcoal found in lake sediments, landslides, and old-growth trees. Research shows large fires have been occurring in Yellowstone since forests became established following the last glacial retreat 14,000 years ago. Yellowstone's fire season typically lasts from mid-June to the end of September. The number and extent of fires that occur each year depend on what efforts are made to suppress the fires, as well as environmental conditions such as the number and timing of lightning storms and the amount and timing of precipitation.

Two of the fires quickly went out on their own, three were suppressed. Since 1988, the number of fires has ranged from 1 to 78 each year.  The most active fire year since 1988 was 2003, when nearly 29,000 acres in Yellowstone burned.  In an average year, approximately 25 fires are ignited in Yellowstone by lightning.  About 75% of fires in Yellowstone never reach more than 0.1 hectares (0.25 acres) in size.  About 92% of fires in Yellowstone never burn more than 40 hectares (100 acres).   Characteristics  Yellowstone's landscape has been shaped by naturally caused fire for 14,000 years.  Factors affecting size and severity of a fire include: type of vegetation where the fire begins; interval since the last stand-replacing fire; moisture in the dead and down logs; length of drought; temperature; humidity; and wind.  In Yellowstone, on average, fires are detected at 3:03 in the afternoon—fires burn most vigorously during the heat of the day, causing tall smoke plumes to be seen by fire lookouts or sharp-eyed park visitors.   Management Issues  The park is required to protect human life as well as the approximately 2% of Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres that are considered developed (e.g., roads, buildings, and other infrastructure) from the threat of fire while at the same time letting fire carry out its ecological role in the landscape as much as possible.        More Information  Fire Management and Current Fire Activity Fire FAQs Fire References",
