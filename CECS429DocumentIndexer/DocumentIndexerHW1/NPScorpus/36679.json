    "body": "Swamp Canyon Camp Site       This site is 1.0 mile (1.6 km) from the Whiteman Bench parking lot, down the Whiteman Connecting Trail. It is just to the north of the junction of the Whiteman Connector and the Under-the-Rim Trail. There are three large Juniper trees, some small White Firs and some Ponderosa Pines at the site. There is no water. The best view in the backcountry is only .15 miles (.24 km) north of this site. The view over Mud Canyon is amazing.
