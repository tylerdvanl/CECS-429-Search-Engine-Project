Virtually all park visitors see some mammals, such as white-tailed deer and gray squirrels. Others, like the big brown bat, striped and spotted skunks are more elusive, remaining largely out of sight until darkness falls. Black bears and bobcats, though sometimes active during the day, seem to remain hidden deep in the forest. The smallest mammals (moles, voles, and shrews) found in the park are rarely seen because they spend much of their lives underground or hidden under leaves and low growing plants. Careful observation should bring rewards in finding many of the wild inhabitants of the park. Just as the number and distribution of mammals varies somewhat from year to year, the number of species present in the park changes over time. For example, coyotes, an adaptable predator, have recently expanded their range in Virginia and can now be found throughout the park.              Mammals  Standard List  Customize Your List       Shenandoah National Park is home to more than 50 mammal species.
