The winter use Adaptive Management Team is the broader public engagement body that encompasses all working groups, and will provide feedback on the overall implementation of the Adaptive Management Program, including Adaptive Management Plan drafts. The Team will focus on the Adaptive Management Program in its entirety, and will meet regularly to coordinate across impact topics, and to provide feedback to the NPS on Adaptive Management Program operations. The team will also discuss the results of monitoring, how those results are related to the impacts that were described in the final Plan\/SEIS, and, if warrented, discuss potential, adaptive changes that may be considered by the NPS. The team is composed of the Adaptive Management Program Coordinator, all working group leads, working group participants and other interested parties.
