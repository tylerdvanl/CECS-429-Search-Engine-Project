There are no streams or springs, and ground water is at least 1900’ deep. Most of the moisture from rain or snow filters rapidly down through the cinders. Water may collect briefly in hollows on the lava flows, but is soon channelled away through cracks. Some of this water finds its way to the edges of the lava flow, forming seepage areas that support isolated islands of vegetation. The plants found in these places are especially adapted to grow in fast-draining volcanic soils.",
