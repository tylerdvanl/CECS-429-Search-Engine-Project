    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Directions & Transportation             Directions & Transportation      Plane  Limited commercial air service is available to Silver City, New Mexico. The nearest major airports are in El Paso, Texas (ELP); Albuquerque, New Mexico (ABQ); Tucson (TUS) and Phoenix (PHX), Arizona; all of which are about four to six hours away by automobile. Note on Mountain Driving  The highway approaching the monument has steep sections of 10-12% grade for several miles. Use lower gears when driving these sections of road to avoid overheating brakes. Slower vehicles should pull over to allow others to pass. In sections of Highway 15 between Silver City and the junction with Highway 35 where the road has no center dividing line, vehicles need to stay as far to the right as possible, especially around curves. The highways approaching the National Monument are not plowed at nights and on weekends. After snowstorms, please call the Visitor Center at 575-536-9461 to find out about road conditions. Car  Take State Highway 15 north from Silver City. Although the distance from Silver City is only 44 miles, the travel time is approximately two hours due to twisting and winding mountain terrain. An alternative route from Silver City is along State Highway 35 and goes through the Mimbres Valley. Even though it is 25 miles longer than Highway 15, it is less winding, wider, more level, and easier to travel; therefore it takes about the same amount of time to drive. NOTE: If your vehicle, travel trailer, or RV is over 20 feet in length, you should take Highway 35. Recreational Vehicles, Large Trailers and Buses  Large vehicles must take Highway 35. To access Highway 35: turn North onto Highway 152 from Highway 180 at Santa Clara, NM. Follow 152 to the junction with 35 and follow 35 to the junction 15. Public Transportation  There is no public transportation to the monument.",
