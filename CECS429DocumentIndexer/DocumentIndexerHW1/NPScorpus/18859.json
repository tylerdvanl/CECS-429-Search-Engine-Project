If you find a grounded seabird anywhere on the island, please call 1-877-428-6911 (Haleakalā National Park Dispatch) to report the finding.      The Hawaiian Petrel (ʻUaʻu) is an endangered species. Its largest known nesting colony is located at the top of Mt. Haleakalā.

They are ground nesters and will aggressively defend their nests. Please support their health and safety in the following ways: Do not approach them, do not feed them, and stay on trail. If a nene is acting aggressively toward you, simply walk away.",
