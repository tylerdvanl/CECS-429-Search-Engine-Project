    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Safety            Safety        During the summer season visitors should dress in light, comfortable clothing, wear comfortable shoes and use sunscreen. We recommended you carry a bottle of water with you. High temperatures and high humidity create higher risk of heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heatstroke. The Historic site is out-of-doors. During the fall visitors should have a light jacket available as temperatures can drop suddenly. Winter temperatures can be unpredictable, ranging from mild to extremely cold.  Insects Visitors should be prepared by wearing appropriate clothing and\/or insect repellant. Here are a few insects to be mindful of: • Biting Flies: also called “deerflies,” “horseflies,” or “Mayflies.” These are most active in late Spring and can last throughout the summer. • Chiggers: are small red mites. Chiggers live in grassy areas so be sure you stay on the approved paths\/trails to reduce the chance of being infected. • Mosquitoes: certain mosquitoes can be vectors of disease. Wearing repellant with DEET will reduce the chances of being bitten. • Gnats: these tiny flying insects travel is swarms and can be very annoying. • Ticks: there are several varieties of tick at Historic Jamestowne. Wearing insect repellant, tucking pants into socks, and inspecting for ticks after a visit is recommended.",
