Â    Come Prepared Choose clothing appropriate for the weather and activity you have chosen and bring enough water. Many sites do not have running water; occasionally water fountains and restrooms may not work at sites that do. Check for ticks, as Lyme disease can occur in this area. If you are walking through tall grass, consider wearing long pants and using insect repellent. Poison ivy is found throughout the park. Learn to identify and avoid it. For your safety and the safety of park wildlife, don't feed the animals. Animals who have been fed may come to expect food from humans. This might lead them to approach people who will hurt them, get hit by a car while hanging out near people, or get sick from eating the wrong food. Do not leave valuables in a parked car. Place them out of sight before arriving at your destination or carry them with you during your visit. Items have been stolen from cars at several sites, including Turkey Run Park and Great Falls Park.",
