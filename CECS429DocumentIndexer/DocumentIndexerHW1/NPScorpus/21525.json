When he came to a sleeping whale, he shot a crossbow arrow into its blowhole and then he got away fast. The next day he looked for it and found it floating. He went home. And the south wind blew. When it stopped blowing, then all the people from the different villages went to Polly Creek and looked for it. They found it floating and tried to move it toward shore. And at Polly Creek it drifted ashore. Thus they named the place, \"'where we found a whale.'\" ~Peter Kalifornsky Read This Book   Paperback: email us to request a copy of this book.       Summary This report describes the culture and history of western Cook Inlet in southcentral Alaska.
