NPS  Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, an army surgeon at Fort Verde from 1884 to 1888 and early excavator at Montezuma Castle, reported four feet of bat guano on the fourth floor rooms!  Even accounting for exaggeration, that's a lot of guano.  Today, we research the bats that now call Montezuma Castle and Well home.  They're important as plant pollinators and they eat many annoying pests, like mosquitoes.   We've found at least 14 different species!  Four of those 14 species are of special concern.  Two species, the Western Red Bat and Townsend's Big-eared Bat are on the Arizona State Wildlife Action Plan as a Tier 1A species, meaning species of greatest conservation need. Two other species, the Big Brown Bats and Little Brown Bats are 2 of the 7 species affected by White-nose Syndrome (WNS). While WNS has not been found in Arizona, it has spread very quickly since first discovered in NY in 2007.  We are especially excited to have these four species within the monument boundaries, see them doing well, and to be able to be a part of the conservation effort!                               Bats in Montezuma Castle Check out the bats that live in Montezuma Castle! Our biologist used an infrared video camera to count the bats, and a sound recorder to identify species.  Watch carefully to see them fly from the right of the tower to the T-shaped door.
