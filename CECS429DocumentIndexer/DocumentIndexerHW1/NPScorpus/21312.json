Download the flyer for all the dates. These ranger-led hikes will vary in length from 2 – 5 miles. Depending on conditions, the hikes may either be on foot or by snowshoe. Participants must provide all  equipment such as snow shoes and safety gear such as layered clothing, appropriate footwear, water, and snacks. Trekking or ski poles are recommended. Participants must be 10 years or older.  These hikes focus on health and not necessarily interpretation of the park's resources. In other words, come prepared for a workout and not a \"normal\" ranger hike. With that said, rangers leading the program will be more than happy to answer questions and point out interesting things along the way. The entrance fee for the park is $5.00 per adult (16 years or older) or free with one of the many federal land passes. For more information please call the Monument at (719) 748 – 3253 ext. 122 or 202",
