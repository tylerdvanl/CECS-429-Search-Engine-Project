    "body": "Video-The Art of Dinosaur Reconstruction       In the summer of 2009, scientific illustrator Liz Bradford created an original painting showing Dinosaur National Monument as it might have looked 150 million years ago. The painting depicts the Morrison Ecosystem - the landscape and environment in which the dinosaurs lived - and several of the Jurassic era dinosaurs themselves, including Diplodocus, Camptosaurus, Stegosaurus, Camarasaurus, Dryosaurus, and Allosaurus.       (object placeholder)      The painting, created by Liz as part of her internship at Dinosaur National Monument, will be displayed in the monument's new visitor center.",
