    "body": "Public Involvement       Public comments regarding a former firing range now within Pinnacles The National Park Service (NPS) and Pinnacles National Park have identified and investigated the impact to the environment, park users and personnel from a historic small arms firing range that is now within the park. The former firing range is located near the east entrance of the park, on lands transferred to the NPS from BLM in January 2000 by Presidential proclamation under the Antiquities Act. Use of the area as a firing range precedes NPS management of the site. Access to the area is currently closed to the general public. The NPS has prepared this notice of its activities regarding the former firing range to provide park users, personnel and adjacent communities the opportunity to learn about and provide feedback to the cleanup effort. The NPS has prepared a fact sheet related to the process and made it available at the park. Technical documents, including the Engineering Evaluation\/Cost Analysis (EE\/CA), related to the investigation of the former firing range are available for review at the Park's Bear Gulch Headquarters conference room at 5000 Highway 146. Public comments will be collected 30 days after this notice, and responses will be provided by the NPS. All comments and responses will be documented in the Administrative Record. Debbie Simmons of the Pinnacles National Park may be contacted with any questions at (831) 389-4286.  Pinnacles National Park Act Congressman Sam Farr (D-Carmel) introduced the Pinnacles National Park Act on July 31, 2009. This bill established Pinnacles National Park in San Benito County. It re-designated Pinnacles Wilderness as Hain Wilderness (converting approximately 2,905 of additional park lands to federally designated Wilderness). The legislation, H.R. 3444, also allows the Interior Secretary to acquire land within the boundaries of the park as deemed necessary. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-Ca) [Cosponsored by Dianne Feinstein (D-Ca)] introduced the Pinnacles National Park Act on September 5, 2010. This bill that would establish Pinnacles National Park in the State of California as a unit of the National Park System. The legislation, S. 3744, also allows the Secretary of the Interior may acquire land or interests in land within the boundaries of Pinnacles National Park by purchase from a willing seller with donated or appropriated funds, donation, or exchange.
