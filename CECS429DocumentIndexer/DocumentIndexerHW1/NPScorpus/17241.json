Of all the places Eugene O'Neill called home during his restless life, Tao (pronounced \"Dow\") House was the one that held him longest, the refuge where he wrote his last plays. In early 1937, he and Carlotta were living in a San Francisco Hotel. \"No roots. No home,\" Carlotta wrote as they searched for a place to live. Drawn to the privacy and climate of the San Ramon Valley, they purchased a 158-acre ranch near Danville and planned what O'Neill hoped would be his final home. A Unique Tour In order to experience this unique national park, visitors arrive by park shuttle from the Town of Danville, California. You'll receive a tour through O'Neill's Tao House, and have time to explore the grounds before returning to Danville on the shuttle.
