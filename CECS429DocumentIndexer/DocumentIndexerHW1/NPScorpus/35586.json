The park's fossils and survey data represent a diverse array of ancient environments, including shallow marine, coastal, desert sand dunes, rivers, and lakes. Ranging from 270 million to 1,600 years old, fossil plants, animals, and tracks are available to scientists, educators, and park managers as a window to past life.       To discover more about specific Zion fossils, click on the links below.
