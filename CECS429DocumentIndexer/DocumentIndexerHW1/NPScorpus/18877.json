The decline of the aquatic mollusk species has been primarily attributed to changes in the river from free-flowing, cold water to impounded, slower, warmer habitats. Another variable is the population increase of non-native invasive aquatic species such as the New Zealand mudsnail (Potamopyrus antipodarum).",
