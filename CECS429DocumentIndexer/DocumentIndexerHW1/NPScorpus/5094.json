The variety of soil types, differences in sun and shade, and variations in moisture create hundreds of micro-habitats and allow Delaware Water Gap to support diverse communities of plants.  While visitors to the Poconos expect to see cool, dark hemlock ravines, as well as hardwood forests, many are surprised to learn that Delaware Water Gap is also home to cactus barrens, sparsely populated with prickly pear cacti. An ambitious explorer can find a great variety of wildflowers in the park, as well as trees, ferns and innumerable other herbaceous plant species.
