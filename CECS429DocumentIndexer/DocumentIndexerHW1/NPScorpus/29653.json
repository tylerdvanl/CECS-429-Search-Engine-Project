Fill out a volunteer application to volunteer your time.     Volunteer with Trails and Rails    The Oklahoma City National Memorial office now leads the Trails & Rails volunteer program that runs through the late spring through early fall. This is an NPS-Amtrak sponsored program that involves volunteers riding aboard the Heartland Flyer train between Oklahoma City and Fort Worth, Texas. Program volunteers introduce train passengers to the cultural and natural heritage of the areas along the train's route. Volunteers also discuss the geologic story of the region and details about the history of the railroads in this part of the country.   Volunteers board the Heartland Flyer at stops between Oklahoma City and Pauls Valley, Oklahoma. They are available for questions and interpretation along the route between Fort Worth and back. All volunteers must be able to stand for long periods of time on a moving train. Trails & Rails involves a full-day commitment with a five-hour layover in Fort Worth. Additionally, all volunteers must agree to participate in a training-introduction program before they board the Flyer. We make every effort to pair newcomers with experienced volunteers.   We are not currently recruiting volunteers for this season. Please check back starting January of 2017 for more information and recruiting possibilities.    If interested, please contact Matt Whitney at 405-609-8860 or matthew_whitney@nps.gov. We look forward to hearing from people.",
