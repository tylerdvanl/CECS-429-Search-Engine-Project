The recordings preserve the first-hand knowledge, memories and ideas of people involved in generations of dairy and cattle ranching, oyster farming, and fishing in the area. Other interviewees speak of Coast Miwok culture, the search for Sir Francis Drake's landing site, service at the Coast Guard station at Point Reyes, and Morse code radio operations at the historic Marconi\/RCA radio stations. Currently, the museum is developing a program to continue collecting and expanding the scope and uses of it's oral history collection. A recent survey conducted by the Seashore yielded an expanded list of oral history programs and collections in Marin relevant to the history of the land and the development of the park. For further information about the oral history collection or program development contact the museum archivist, Carola DeRooy at 415-464-5125 or by e-mail.
