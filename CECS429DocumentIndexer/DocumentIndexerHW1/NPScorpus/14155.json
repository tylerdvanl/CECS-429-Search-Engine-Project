The ford came to be known at Paso de Jacinto. By the turn of the 19th century, the crossing was marked on maps as Paso de los Indios. A century later, the Old Indian Crossing (the English name) was a well-known landmark near the northern edge of Fort McIntosh. The significance of the ford to the history of Laredo is underscored by the presence of a nearby ranch known as Rancho Paso de los Indios. Historic features like these offer a reminder of the need for routes across the river. Time period: 1740s Ownership: Private      A Photographic Journey of the Trail - NEXT IMAGE PREVIOUS IMAGE",
