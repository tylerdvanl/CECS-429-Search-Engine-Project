NPS Photo    Â    Imuruk Lake borders a northern edge of the 100,000 acres Imuruk Lave Beds in the Bering Land Bridge  National Preserve. The seeming harshness of the lava beds contrasts with the apparent vitality of  Imuruk Lake. The two create an interesting landscape of shapes and colors. Early people to enter the  current area of the preserve, probably viewed the lava beds and the lake as equally valuable for different  types of resources. The lava beds have an abundance of small rodents and loose rubble and the lake  is home to fish and birds. The area surrounding Imuruk Lake was also a place where the territorial  boundaries of four nineteenth century regional groups met. The rich resources in the area brought  several groups for caribou drives and other subsistence activities. At times, these groups fought over  the territory boundaries near Imuruk Lake. However, their interactions did not always come to violence; instead, the meetings sometimes involved trade and cooperation. Evidence of the various groups that  used the Imuruk Lake area still remain, showcasing the many ways humans have interacted with the  preserve.  The caribou hunts at Imuruk Lake required a large amount manpower, as well as careful planning and organizing. At one spot near the lake, hunters built a series of fence-like stone cairns meant to funnel caribou over the edge of a ridge onto a small flat area bordering the lake. A second group of hunters  waiting in kayaks on the lake, ambushed the caribou as the panicked animals ran into the lake. Stone rubble from the Imuruk Lava Beds supplied materials to build cairns, hunting blinds, and food caches. These stone structures were vital to the survival of early people because of the difficulty finding other types of usable materials. Early people also found ways to take advantage of the location of the lava beds in relation to Imuruk Lake. Caribou dislike walking on bare lava because it hurts their legs and feet. Keeping that in mind, the hunters drove the caribou towards the lava, forcing the caribou to either run on the lava or run into the lake. Hunter in kayaks then killed the caribou as they entered the lake. Early people to the area recognized the value of the relationship between the lava beds and Imuruk Lake and used the two natural features in harmony.",
