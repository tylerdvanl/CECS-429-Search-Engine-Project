The service is available 24\/7\/365 with no restrictions on the length or number of calls placed. All calls are strictly confidential, and no records of conversations are ever maintained. 1. Dial 7-1-1 from anywhere inside South Dakota, or dial toll-free (800) 877-1113 from anywhere outside the state. 2.
