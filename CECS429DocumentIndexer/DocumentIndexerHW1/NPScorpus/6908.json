These plants provide the necessary shelter and structure for wildlife and food for herbivores, or animals that eat plants. Trees are the primary structure of the forest habitat types, while shrubs dominate the understory. The forest ecosystems are dominated by hardwood trees, mostly oaks and hickories. Three coniferous trees, Virginia pine, shortleaf pine, and loblolly pine, can be found mixed within the hardwoods or in small stands. Some of the common trees and shrubs are winged sumac, white oak, water oak, black cherry, yellow poplar, eastern redbud, American elm, common persimmon, mockernut hickory, and red maple.",
