    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility             Accessibility          Petroglyph National Monument was established in 1990 and is considered a young  National Park unit. The monument is cooperatively managed by the National Park Service and the City of Albuquerque Open Space Division. Currently we are moderately limited on accessible features. On the other hand, each project that is started and implemented by the National Park Service takes into account accessibility.      Las Imágenes Visitor Center - The visitor center is fully accessible with parking spaces and chair ramps. Monument staff members are on duty to provide you with personalized information and to assist you in planning your visit. This site also has a tactile exhibit of petroglyphs so all visitors can experience the feel of a petroglyph. (Touching of actual petroglyphs is strongly discouraged to prevent damage to these irreplaceable resources.) Park brochures in Braille and in large print are available at the visitor center.            Boca Negra Canyon - Trails are not accessible, however, petrogyphs may be easily seen using the view scope located at the Macaw trail shaded patio. Accessible: Parking lots, patio, and restrooms. Rinconada Canyon - The Rinconada Canyon Trail is not accessible at this time. Accessible: Parking lot, vault restroom, picnic picnic tables, and shade structures.  Volcanoes - This recently developed area has a trail that is partially prepared for wheelchair access. Funds are being appropriated to complete accessibility of this trail to its full 1 mile length. Accessible: Parking lot, vault restrooms, and shade structure. For questions concerning accessibility call the Visitor Center at (505) 899-0205 ext. 335 or the Chief of Interpretation at ext. 230.",
