The studio, in the rehabilitated Rockefeller Horse Shed, is off the grid with a vertically integrated 230 watt solar photovoltaic system. The project was designed by SAS Architects of Burlington, Vermont, the same firm who designed the Forest Center, the park's Platinum LEED certified classroom and meeting space. Our partners, and the park's previous artists-in-residence were consulted in the design process to address the needs of current and future artists at the park. The Horse Shed, designed by Theodor Muller and built in 1961, was originally constructed to house Mary Rockefeller's horses.       The studio with an art installation by 2012 Artist-in-Residence, Andrea Polli. The installation features fanciful, hand-blown glass vessels inspired by Helmholz acoustic resonators. Holmholz resonators were first created by Hermann von Helmholz in the 1850s to identify sound frequencies in music.
