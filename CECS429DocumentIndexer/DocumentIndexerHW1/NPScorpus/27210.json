The Teacher Guide is to be used in conjunction with a visit to Charles Pinckney NHS, Fort Moultrie, Fort Sumter, and the Fort Sumter Visitor Education Center at Liberty Square. The National Park Service values education and strives to help students and teachers learn the unique history of special places.  National Park Service staff and volunteers developed this guide that connects the state curriculum standards to the NPS sites in the Charleston area. We encourage you to apply any of the material found in the guide to plan visits or enrich and augment the materials you present to your students in the classroom.
