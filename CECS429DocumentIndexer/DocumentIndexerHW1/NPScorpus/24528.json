    "body": "Places to Go: Harpers Corner Area       Located on the Colorado side of the monument, Harpers Corner Drive is a scenic, 32-mile (55-km) road that leads to the heart of Dinosaur National Monument's canyon country. Overlooks offer sweeping vistas of the Green and Yampa river canyons. Several picnic areas and the trailheads of three hiking trails are located just off Harpers Corner Drive. On one trail, sharp-eyed hikers can spot fossils of small sea creatures that lived long ago. Visitors prepared for remote driving conditions can access two unimproved roads from Harpers Corner Drive. Fuel, food, and other services are not available along Harpers Corner Drive. The nearest services are in Dinosaur, Colorado, two miles west of the Canyon Area Visitor Center on Highway 40.         View of Split Mountain Canyon from the end of Ruple Point Trail NPS  Hiking Trails Situated on top of a butte, the paved, wheelchair accessible Plug Hat Trail introduces visitors to the pinyon-juniper forest and offers sweeping vistas of the Colorado Plateau landscape. On the Harpers Corner Trail, situated on a ridge above the Green River, hikers can explore the pinyon-juniper forest and enjoy unsurpassed views of Steamboat Rock, the Green and Yampa rivers, and Whirlpool Canyon.

NPS  Fossils At the end of the Harpers Corner Trail, look closely at the rock underfoot. Those with a keen eye and a bit of patience will find the fossilized remains of small sea creatures that lived hundreds of millions of years ago. Look for the clam-like shells of brachiopods and for pieces of the stems of crinoids, ancient relative of the starfish. The rock around these fossils was once mud at the bottom of an ancient sea. There are no dinosaur fossils in the Harpers Corner area.        Upper section of the road to Echo Park   Unimproved Roads  The turnoff for Echo Park Road is located on Harpers Corner Drive, 25 miles (40 km) from Highway 40. The 13-mile (21-km), unpaved Echo Park Road is steep, with hairpin turns for the first several miles. The road ends at Echo Park which has a campground, boat launch, and hiking trails. Echo Park Road is impassable when wet.  The 27-mile (43-km) Yampa Bench Road, recommended for high clearance, four-wheel drive vehicles only, can be reached from the Echo Park Road.
