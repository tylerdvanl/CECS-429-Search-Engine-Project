Frank       The park contains about 325 different vascular plant species. Types include shrubland, mixed sage and juniper woodland, pinyon-juniper forest, and riparian communities. Rabbitbrush, cliffrose, Mormon tea, yucca, and serviceberry, which were important to prehistoric ancestral Puebloans, are all still common. Historic sheep grazing eliminated much of the park’s ground cover and caused soil loss, but exotic plants have not had a great impact to date.  An official species list and park flora are available from the Northern Colorado Plateau Network. You may also download a brochure on Hovenweep plants.",
