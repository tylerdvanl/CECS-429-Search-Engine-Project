Chances are, if you live in or near a big city, you can only see a few of the millions of stars and planets that fill the night sky. Light pollution can obscure all but the very brightest stars, and most cities do not control excess or unneccessary night lighting. When you venture out into the more uninhabited areas, the night sky comes alive with an uncountable number of stars. The Chiricahua mountains are in an area of spectacular, dark night skies. Some of the world's largest telescopes are located on nearby mountains for just this reason.  People have always looked to the stars - whether to navigate, to worship, or to mark the passage of time or season - it seems a timeless way to dream about and ponder at the vastness of the universe. A visit to the Monument is not complete without looking skyward into the dark night sky!",
