Teachers selected as teacher-rangers spend the summer performing various duties depending on their interests and the needs of the Preserve.

The Teacher-Ranger-Teacher program provides a stipend and professional development credits.  Once they return to their schools, teacher-rangers bring their national preserve knowledge and experiences into the school and classrooms throughout the school year to engage students, faculty, and staff in lessons and activities that relate to Big Cypress National Preserve and other National Park Service sites.
