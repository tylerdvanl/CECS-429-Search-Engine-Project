The vast majority of backcountry users kayak and camp along the coastal fjords. Each year a small number of adventurers also challenge the Harding Icefield - the vast expanse of snow and ice that dominates inland portions of the park.   Inland areas that aren't icebound consist mainly of sheer cliffs, steep gorges, and box canyons, often covered by dense vegetation.   This challenging wilderness will test the mettle of even the most experienced backcountry traveler. It is not a place for beginners, but several licensed outfitters do offer guided backcountry trips.   Â     Backcountry Registration   Backcountry Safety Prepare for your backcountry visit.
