In 1776, two Franciscan priests, Francisco Atanasio Domínguez and Silvestre Vélez de Escalante, left Santa Fe with the intention of finding a route to missions in Monterey, California. They made detailed recordings of their findings through Arizona, Colorado, and Utah during their trip. They befriended Ute tribes by presenting them with gifts and promising to teach them to farm and raise livestock.        John Charles Fremont's expedition passed through the North District of Capitol Reef as evidenced by this daguerrotype taken by Carvalho. NPS  In the winter of 1853, John Charles Fremont passed through Utah and Colorado, attempting to find a northern railroad route to the Pacific Ocean. The expedition was difficult and the explorers were forced to eat their horses before stumbling upon a Mormon settlement. Fremont took care to document their journey, hiring a daguerrotypist, Solomon Nunes Carvalho, to accompany them. Carvalho took nearly 300 daguerreotypes, most of which were unfortunately lost in a fire after the expedition. However, one of the remaining images was identified from the northern district of the park as the formation \"Mom, Pop, and Henry\". Fremont and his men also recorded their encounters with Ute and Southern Paiute Indians. John Wesley Powell, a former Major for the Union Army and avid naturalist, traveled with nine geologists and geographers down the Colorado River and through the Grand Canyon in 1869. Powell was formulating a theory about the formation of the Colorado Plateau and Colorado River. Traveling on the Colorado River, the men explored Zion and Bryce Canyons as well as the surrounding Henry and Uinta Mountains. They encountered Ute, Paiute, and other native peoples, studying their ways of life and recording their culture. to Fremont Culture  to Pioneer Settlers",
