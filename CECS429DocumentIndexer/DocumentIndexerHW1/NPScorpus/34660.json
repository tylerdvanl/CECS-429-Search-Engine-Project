RV Information Although Shenandoah National Park doesn't have a campground that is just for RVs, it does have three campgrounds that will accommodate large RVs. Mathews Arm, Big Meadows and Loft Mountain campgrounds all have pull-through and deep back-in sites which most of the time can even handle an RV with a tow vehicle. Although we do not offer hookups, the campgrounds do have potable water and all but Lewis have dump stations.       Mathews Arm Campground Mathews Arm Campground is currently accepting reservations for July and August 2016. No additional reservations are available beginning September 1, 2016, due to the start of a scheduled major rehabilitation construction project of the campground sewage system. Currently, the end of the project is scheduled for mid-April, 2017. Reservations will resume upon receipt of a firm completion date from the contractor.
