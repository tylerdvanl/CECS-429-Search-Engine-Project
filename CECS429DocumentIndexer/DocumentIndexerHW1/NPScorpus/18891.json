    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Safety            Safety         Whether you are on a long or short hike, be prepared.Â  NPS  Hiking can be a lot of fun at Hagerman ; however, you are a long way from medical assistance, so please plan ahead. Wear sturdy shoes; carry water and a flashlight. Remember the sun and heat...snakes and scorpions...know your hiking limitations...and have a safe, good time. Safety first, last, and always!!!  The Essentials for hiking  Plans: Be sure to tell someone your plans - when you are leaving, where you are going, and when you will return. Leave this information in your vehicle also.     Bring your cell phone: Though there are some areas in the park where cell phones do not work well, most phones today have location devices that emergency services can activate to locate you.    Food and Water: Carry high-energy snacks and plenty of water. Potable water is available from the Visitor Center so make sure to fill your water bottle even on a short day hike.   Clothing: Weather can change dramatically here. Dress appropriately.   Sun Protection: Sunglasses and sunscreen.   First Aid: Make sure to include any special medications.   Knife: Folding pocket knife.   Signal: Carry both an audible and visual signal, such as a whistle and a metal mirror.   Trail Safety: Please stay on designated trails. The ground is unstable in some areas and the plants and animals are fragile.     The Most Important Essential: This is your call. Think about what might be important to you. For some, it might be strong insect repellant, for others, your camera. Everyone should try to take along a lot of common sense.",
