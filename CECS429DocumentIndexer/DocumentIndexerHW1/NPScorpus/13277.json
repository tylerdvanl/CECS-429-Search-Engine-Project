Set aside as a national park in 1890, Yosemite is a place visited by almost four million visitors each year. Yosemite's goal is to provide the highest level of accessibility to our visitors as possible. Each year has shown marked improvements in both physical and programmatic accessibility at Yosemite.  The staff at Yosemite is working hard to correct and resolve accessibility deficiencies throughout the park. By using principles of universal design, Yosemite is committed to providing physical access to the greatest number of individuals. From designing and building new facilities to the rehabilitation of older buildings, accessibility has become a key component of all projects. The park also offers a free fully accessible shuttle bus service in Yosemite Valley to all park visitors.  For more information, download the park's accessibility guide [2 MB PDF], which describes access to areas, facilities, and services for people with disabilities. In addition, our Deaf Services Program is dedicated to connecting the Deaf community to everything Yosemite has to offer. Finally, we have a visual guide to visiting Yosemite Valley for people with aphasia [1.5 MB PDF].",
