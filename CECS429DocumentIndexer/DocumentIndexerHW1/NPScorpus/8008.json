Obviously, the weather can vary tremendously as well. Higher elevations can be in the clouds and cause foggy driving conditions, so be aware that if it is a grey and cloudy day, you may have poor visibility.  Summer along the Parkway means cooler than normal temperatures, especially at the higher elevations. It is always a good idea to carry an extra jacket or blanket and a few emergency supplies in the car. Be aware of changing weather conditions and approaching weather systems, as summer heat can bring afternoon summer thunderstorms most days. Luckily, these storms pass quickly!
