The trail to the Cliff Dwellings is not paved and both the final section ascending to the Dwellings and the trail descending from them are very steep. The Dwellings are entered via a short staircase and may be exited, if desired, via a wooden ladder. Part of the \"Trail to the Past\" at the nearby Lower Scorpion Campground is wheelchair accessible (for viewing of pictographs).The Gila Visitor Center and the trailhead Contact Station are wheelchair accessible. An interactive CD is availble at the Gila Visitor Center.",
