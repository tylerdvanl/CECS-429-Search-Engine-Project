    "body": "Virtual Tour Stop, Fredericksburg Road        The fighting at Spotsylvania started on the Brock Road, then over the next several days shifted south to the Po River and then north to the Muleshoe. After May 12, the fighting shifted again. This time to the east as the Fredericksburg Road and later the Massaponax Church Road became avenues of Union advance. The Fredericksburg Road shown here also became the lifeline for the Union army. All wounded soldiers going north to hospitals followed this route and all supplies and reinforcements coming into the army used this road.    Â      Harris Farm today.
