    "body": "American Recovery And Reinvestment Act 2009       Not only are national parks a link to our nation’s rich cultural and natural heritage, they are an integral part of our country’s economic future. National parks and the millions of people who visit them generate billions of dollars in economic benefit nationwide. Today, as our nation pulls together to recover from the most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression, the National Park Service has been asked to help. And we are eager to do our part. Through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), the National Park Service will invest $750 million in nearly 800 projects throughout the country. This accounts for nearly one-third of the entire $3 billion of Department of Interior Recovery Act funding. The National Park Service will also receive an additional $170 million through the Federal Highway Administration for work on Federal Highway System roads in national parks. Recovery Act projects were selected through a rigorous process that identified projects meeting specific criteria – address the highest priority mission needs; create the largest number of jobs in the shortest period of time; and create lasting value for the American people.  Important Links For more information about the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, go to www.recovery.gov. To track the progress of various projects and learn about how ARRA funds are being utilized by the National Park Service and other agencies throughout the Department of the Interior, go to www.doi.gov\/recovery. Creating and saving jobs is a key goal of the Recovery Act. One way this can be accomplished is through federal agencies, such as the National Park Service, awarding contracts to various outside contractors\/vendors to assist with specific ARRA projects.  National Park Service business opportunities are published on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Web site, www.fbo.gov, as they become available. To compete for any federal project, vendors must be registered on the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Web site at www.ccr.gov. Registration is free.   Individuals can look for Recovery Act jobs through the federal government by going to www.usajobs.opm.gov and clicking on the link, “Opportunities currently available under the Recovery Act.”",
