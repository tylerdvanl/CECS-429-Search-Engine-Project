Colorado National Monument is committed to conserve the natural wonders and resources within and beyond our boundaries. Colorado National Monument continues to reach for improvements everyday in all the ways we use energy, recycle materials, and conserve natural resources.             Reducing Waste In the summer of 2012, Colorado National Monument installed a water bottle filling station at the Saddlehorn Visitor Center to help reduce disposable water bottle waste. Every year Colorado National Monument staff pick up discarded water bottles all along Historic Rim Rock Drive, and throughout our  canyons.",
