An NPS Photo   Â   The official logo for the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail was developed from a design by Cherokee artist Gary Allen of Tahlequah, Oklahoma. As the official trail logo, it is used on signs for the trail's auto tour route, to mark trail sites and segments, on official trail publications and other materials, and for other official trail uses. The logo represents the trail and all trail partners working toward the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Management and Use Plan for the trail. The National Park Service encourages the appropriate use of the logo by trail partners. However, the trail logo is considered to be a protected federal mark under the law and cannot be used without the permission of the Superintendent of the National Trails Intermountain Region. For permission to use the logo, please contact: Superintendent National Trails Intermountain Region P.O.
