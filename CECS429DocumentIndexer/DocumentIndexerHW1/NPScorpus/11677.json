To maintain these buildings, the Seashore created a historic preservation crew led by an exhibit specialist in 1999. During the next two years, the crew completed over 30 projects throughout the park and constructed a new carpentry shop at the historic RCA Point Reyes Receiving Station.Preservation work in 2001 included repairs at the Spaletta Dairy (historic C Ranch), Pierce Ranch, and the Giacomini Ranch in Olema Valley. At the Wilkins Ranch, in addition to work completed by the crew and Seashore contractors, the park hosted the University of Oregon's Historic Preservation Field School which provided training in preservation philosophy and craft to professionals, students and others interested in historic preservation. 2001 also saw contractors begin a rehabilitation of the Murphy (Home) Ranch main house, and the completion of design for a major rehabilitation project at the Lighthouse.Top of Page",
