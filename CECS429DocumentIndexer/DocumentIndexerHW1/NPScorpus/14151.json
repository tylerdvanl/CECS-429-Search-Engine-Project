It was temporarily settled in 1810 by Eugenio Gutierrez who received a grant from the Spanish Crown for two sitios (ca. 8,856 acres). He constructed the ranch headquarters near a large natural spring (ojuelos). This site is a good example of the type of multipurpose hacienda (socio-economic-agricultural-religious establishment) that evolved close to Dolores in South Texas, adjacent to the Río Grande.
