Today, ongoing research and advances in technology guide the park's efforts to restore and preserve this place for the future. Preservation at Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site is managed under three departments - the Facility Maintenance Division, the Natural Resource Division, and the Museum Services Division. Park staff routinely monitors resource conditions, identifies preservation needs, and oversees preservation work undertaken by park employees and contractors. Together, the professional staff works to ensure that visitors to Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site experience the property much as it was during the Vanderbilt's ownership.",
