There are five separate entrances to the park, and one Main Park Road which runs North-South through the park.  The Main Park Road runs between the Northwest (Manzanita Lake) park entrance and the Southwest park entrance.   Dead-end roads provide access to Butte Lake, Juniper Lake, and Warner Valley areas. * Park roads are closed to vehicles much of the year due to winter snow accumulation.  Click HERE to learn the status of park roads.  Please note that GPS units (including smart phones) do not always provide accurate directions in and around Lassen. Lassen covers over 106,000 acres and does not have a single address. We do not recommend using GPS units for directions in and around Lassen. If you do use a GPS unit, just keep in mind that if there is a conflict between what the road sign says and what your GPS unit says, the road sign is correct.
