Local students can celebrate their creativity through the Youth Arts in the Parks program. This youth art contest and April art exhibition at Tamarack allows students to serve as community leaders and raise awareness of Appalachia’s natural diversity and parks. Their works will inspire community connections to local ecology, as well as outdoor stewardship. Student participants in this art program will also have the opportunity to explore the business of art and its role in economic development. This wildflower art contest is open to all K – 12 grade students in Fayette, Nicholas, Raleigh, and Summers Counties. Students may use a variety of mediums to create a work of art inspired by a spring Appalachian wildflower native to the New River Gorge area of West Virginia. Entry deadline: February 1 to 7, 2016.
