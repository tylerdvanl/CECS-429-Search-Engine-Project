(NPS photo)  The diversity of plant life that inhabits Valley Forge National Historical Park is directly related to the geology and hydrology of the area. As you look out across a meadow, for example, you can see large and small patches of a particular plant species. If you look a bit more, you will notice the curvature of the ground and perhaps pools or streams of water. Each plant species has a particular range of light, soil and moisture conditions in which it grows well. Over 730 species of plants are known to occur within the park. Grasslands, shrublands, woodlands, forests, ornamental plantings, and croplands can be found throughout the park. Plant ecologists from the Pennsylvania Natural Heritage Program and NatureServe recently mapped and classified the park's vegetation using the National Vegetation Classification System (NVCS).
