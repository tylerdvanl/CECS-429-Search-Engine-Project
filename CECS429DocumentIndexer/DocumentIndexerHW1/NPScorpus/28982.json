    "body": "Volunteer        Colonel Theodore Roosevelt and the 'Rough Riders' Volunteer Regiment after the Battle of San Juan Hill in Cuba (July, 1898). NPS       \"Get action. Seize the moment. Man was never intended to become an oyster.\" - Theodore Roosevelt.   Theodore Roosevelt did his part during the Spanish American War by forming a regiment known as the 'Rough Riders', 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry. You can do your part by volunteering at Sagamore Hill N.H.S.!            Sagamore Hill could not function as it does today without its volunteers. Our volunteer program allows the site's staff to accomplish a wide range of activities that need to be done, but can not always be done with our limits on money and person-power. A core group of sixty volunteers - retirees, parents, singles, couples, high school and college students - contributed over 5,000 hours of effort with a value of $100,000 dollars last year to Sagamore Hill. Volunteers provide tours to thousands of family visitors and school children each year, answer telephones and greet visitors. They catalog and care for thousands of papers and museum objects related to the Roosevelt family. Volunteers also perform much needed maintenance on the fences, fields, structures and infrastructure of Sagamore Hill. Their efforts allow park staff to focus on long-term projects, planning, and many other tasks they need to do.
