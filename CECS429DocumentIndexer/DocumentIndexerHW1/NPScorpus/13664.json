    "body": "Fishing       The park has several public fishing sites. Constitution Gardens Lake is located in downtown Washington, D.C. and has been designated for catch and release fishing only. Within the 6.75 acre lake, there are populations of large mouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie. Constitution Gardens Lake is also the site for National Fishing and Boating Week activities, which draws considerable public and media attention.  Fishing is also allowed along the banks of both the Tidal Basin and East and West Potomac Park. However, except for a few days in June during National Fishing and Boating Week (see dates at DC Department of the Environment website), a District of Columbia fishing license is required to fish in the park. These regulations are enforced so visitors must apply for a District fishing license. Once licensed, anglers must maintain possession of the license while angling and shall display the license at all times. D.C. Department of Health urges limited consumption of fish caught from Anacostia and Potomac Rivers. For further information, visit the DC Department of Health web site.",
