This short video captures their results.  Duration:2 minutes, 2 seconds           Â    The following are ways bicyclists can increase their visibility on the Parkway:   Wear brightly-colored, high-visibility clothing.       Use hand signals to let motorists know what you will be doing next.       Avoid the Tupelo, MS, and Jackson, MS, areas between the hours of 7:00 am - 9:00 am and 4:00 pm - 6:00 pm, due to an increased volume of vehicle traffic. Consider the Ridgeland Area Multi-Use Trail as an alternate route.          Bicyclists will frequently be riding in mixed sun and shade. Use a flashing white light on the back of your bike during the day.     Plan to be off of the Parkway between sundown and sunup.         Use a solid white light that is visible from a distance of at least 500 feet to the front.       Use a flashing red light that is visible from at least 200 feet to the rear.",
