This area has been a homeland to people for thousands of years.   From 7,000 - 500 B.C.E., Archaic hunters and gatherers migrated through the canyons hunting game that is common now (bighorn sheep, deer, elk, pronghorn).   From 300 - 1300 C.E., the Fremont Culture began farming corn, beans, and squash. Petroglyphs etched in rock walls and painted pictographs remain as sacred remnants of the ancient Indians' saga.  Beginning in 1854, several groups of explorers and surveyors made their way through the area that would become Capitol Reef and the surrounding areas.   Pioneers and other settlers arrived in the 1800s, settling in what is now the Fruita Rural Historic District. They planted and nurtured orchards of apples, pears, and peaches.  In 1937, Capitol Reef was established as a National Monument and a new chapter began in the history of Capitol Reef with the park founders.
