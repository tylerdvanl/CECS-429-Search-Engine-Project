    "body": "Desert Tortoise          Desert Tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) The desert tortoise is a long-lived, slow growing tortoise and is estimated to live from 50 to possibly 100 years!  They are common, yet often unseen at Saguaro National Park. The majority of their long lives is spent in burrows where they escape the cold winter temperatures and extreme summer heat.  Desert tortoises are well adapted to arid conditions and conserve water in several ways. They have thick skin to prevent water loss, and they excrete dry uric acid instead of urine. Also, tortoises can store water in their large urinary bladders. This stored water can be used in self defense if necessary.  It is apparantly distasteful to predators, and when frightened, the tortoise may suddenly empty its bladder.  However, this defense can be costly in times of drought, and the tortoise could die of dehydration if it can not replace the fluids.
