NPS Photo  The purchase of products and services designed to reduce impacts on human health and the environment is known as green purchasing. These environmentally preferred products can be biodegradable, recyclable, highly efficient, or include recycled materials, use renewable energy, and more.   Golden Gate National Recreation Area has a Green Purchasing Policy to implement these beneficial purchasing practices. While it seems simple, green purchasing has the ability to positively influence local and global environmental challenges. Products that contain naturally derived ingredients instead of chemicals can help reduce the use of damaging chemicals. Products made with recycled materials can provide a market for goods diverted from landfills and decrease the use of virgin materials. Overall, green purchasing supports the National Park Service's mission to preserve the natural and cultural resources of the parks.
