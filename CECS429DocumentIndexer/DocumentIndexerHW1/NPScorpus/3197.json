Saguaro National Park is a two district park on the east and west side of Tucson. Although they are part of thesame park the two districts are vastly different. The low elevation west district has primarily Sonoran desert vegetation and receives only 12 inches of rain per year. The east district rises from the valley floor to over 8,000 feet elevation at Mica Mountain with vegetation communities ranging from desert scrub to temperate pine forests. Mica Mountain receives over 30 inches of precipitation per year providing water to springs and streams farther down the mountain front.  Explore the park's water resources, learn about research the park is conducting to better understand them, and discover some of the threats to the waters.",
