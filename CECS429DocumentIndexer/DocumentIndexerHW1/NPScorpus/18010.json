These trunks, one Union and one Confederate, contain reproduction items worn and carried by the common soldier during the early years of the American Civil War.  Some items include uniform pieces such as trousers, coats and brogans (boots), as well as personal items such as playing cards, tin cups and candles. Each trunk contains the Thunder in the Ozarks The Battle of Pea Ridge DVD, a book of Civil War activities and other resources on the Battle of Pea Ridge and the Civil War in Arkansas.  All items are the property of Pea Ridge National Military Park and the renter is responsible for all damaged and\/or lost items.  These trunks must be picked up and dropped off by the educator checking them out.  We cannot mail traveling trunks.  The trunks have separate schedules so there may only be one available at any time. Trunks are free to rent and available year round. Click the Parks as Classrooms link to the left for more information and the reservation list.
