Recreation fees collected under FLREA are reinvested into the parks to benefit the visitor through addressing deferred maintenance and enhancing the visitor experience.  In many parks, 80-percent of the recreation fees remain at the site where collected, the other 20-percent is used at parks where fees are not collected or for youth corps programs.  Voyageurs National Park is an exception because the park collects under the established $500,000 threshold, allowing us to keep 96-percent of the fees collected within the park.
