Fire Island Lighthouse  The Fire Island Light Station, located on the west end of Fire Island National Seashore, is maintained to interpret the rich local and maritime heritage.  Because of the dynamic natural processes that shape the Fire Island landscape, and other adverse factors in the environment such as salt spray, there are few intact structures more than 50 years old on Fire Island and adjacent islands and bays.  None of the lifesaving stations that were established on Fire Island during the 19th and early 20th centuries remain intact, but few structures have been moved or converted to other uses.
