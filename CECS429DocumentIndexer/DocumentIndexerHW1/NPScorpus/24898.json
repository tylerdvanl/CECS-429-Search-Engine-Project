Continuous permafrost underlies almost the entire tundra of the Arctic and Northwest Alaska. Its upper layer is known as the permafrost table, which acts as a barrier so that no water can move (percolate) through the ground. It can extend more than 2,000 feet underground to where it gets too warm from heat at the earth's core. Well that's cool (literally and figuratively!), but why is permafrost important, you ask? As a matter of fact, permafrost is the world's largest \"carbon sink.\" In other words, permafrost stores carbon - actually 1,672 billion metric tons, or twice the amount of carbon stored in the atmosphere! Basically when a plant or animal dies above the permafrost, it does not decay and release its carbon into the atmosphere, but instead eventually freezes into the permafrost. With warming temperatures from climate change however, the permafrost is melting. This makes the soil weak and unstable, and things like buildings built on top of it can shift or collapse. In addition, the carbon that was stored up inside will be released into the atmosphere, adding to the greenhouse gases already accelerating the rate of climate change. So, long story short, permafrost is a vital part of the Arctic environment.",
