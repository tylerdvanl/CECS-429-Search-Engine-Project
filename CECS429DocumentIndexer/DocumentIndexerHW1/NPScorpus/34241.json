The program is an exciting experience for those wanting to explore the park. There are two booklets, grouped by age, which can be signed out at the Visitor Center desk. Most Junior Rangers complete the booklet in one to two hours, but may take as much time as they wish to finish. Children who complete the booklet earn a Junior Ranger Badge to honor their accomplishments.    Want to explore more of your National Parks? Many National Parks offer Junior Ranger programs both in the park and on the Internet. Visit WebRangers for more information on web-based programs. For a complete listing of all National Parks offering Junior Ranger programs in the park itself, visit the Ranger Zone.       Children's Room    Games, coloring activities, and puzzles are available here.  The highlight of the room is the please-touch table, where children can explore items they may encounter in the park.       Junior Ranger Camp   *The Junior Ranger Camp will not be offered for the Summer of 2014.  A two-day summer camp is offered each year at Great Falls Park for children, ages 8-11.

All Junior Ranger activities are offered free of charge. Contact the park to learn more or to make a reservation.",
