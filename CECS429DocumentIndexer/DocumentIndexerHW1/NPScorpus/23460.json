The IDA works to protect the night skies for present and future generations. They advocate for the protection of the night sky, educate the public and policy makers about night sky conservation, promote environmentally responsible outdoor lighting, and empower the public with the tools and resources to bring back the night sky. Chaco Culture National Historical Park is one of few places left in the continental U.S. with a natural, dark night sky. In 2013, Chaco was designated as an International Dark Sky site. The park works with IDA to preserve this natural, dark night sky by minimizing artificial lighting, using directed lighting, and other methods.      United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) UNESCO seeks to encourage the identification, protection, and preservation of cultural and natural heritage around the world considered to be of outstanding value to humanity.

This World Heritage Convention treaty was adopted by UNESCO in 1972.  In 1987, Chaco Culture National Historical Park was designated as a World Heritage Site, joining the ranks of such sites as the Great Wall of China, the Acropolis of Greece, Petra in Jordan, Stonehenge in Great Britain, and others considered of outstanding value to humanity.
