    "body": "Theodore Roosevelt       President - Colonel - Rough Rider - Father - Naturalist - Rancher Theodore Roosevelt was all of these things and more. His life was one of constant challenge and adventure. Few know that he worked as a rancher during his mid-20s; fewer still know the influence that time had on the future leader of our nation. This section of the website will help you learn more about Roosevelt's time in the Badlands of the Dakota Territory, and how his personal experiences influenced his political accomplishments. Roosevelt in the Badlands When a young Theodore Roosevelt stepped from his train car in September 1883, he had only a dim idea of what lay before him in the remote settlement of Little Missouri. Roosevelt’s interest in hunting a buffalo, as well as some personal interest in the lifestyle of the West, had led him to this remote outpost. With his pregnant wife Alice at home 2,400 miles away, Roosevelt stood alone in the dark as the train lurched away toward Montana. He knew no one in the small settlement before him, and was unsure how the locals might receive him. The four-eyed New York dude was immersed in a world he had only read about, a place that bristled with distrust of outsiders, especially Easterners. Roosevelt could not have imagined how his adventure in this unfamiliar environment would forever alter the course of his life.      Theodore Roosevelt and the Ranch Life  Theodore Roosevelt the Rancher Roosevelt's Maltese Cross Cabin Roosevelt's Elkhorn Ranch Site  The Legacy of Theodore Roosevelt  Theodore Roosevelt & Conservation Theodore Roosevelt Timeline Theodore Roosevelt Related Web Sites Theodore Roosevelt Quotes",
