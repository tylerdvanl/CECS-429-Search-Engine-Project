    "body": "Park Ranger Programs       Whether you seek a short interaction or plan to fill multiple days attending these programs, park rangers are here to help you understand, appreciate and take care of your park. Programs are typically offered from late May or early June until mid-September.   With the exception of Discovery Hikes and the Kantishna Experience Tour, all ranger hikes, sled dog demonstrations, campground programs and other talks in Denali are free and do not require you to sign up in advance. Discovery Hikes are technically free, but will likely require you to purchase a bus ticket and you must sign up for them in advance.                 Sled Dog Demonstrations   Watch a ranger ride around a track and talk about the historic and modern uses of Alaskan huskies in Denali.           Ranger-Led Trail Hikes   Join a ranger to hike a trail from either the Denali Visitor Center or Eielson Visitor Center.          Ranger Talks   Join a ranger at a campground or elsewhere for short, informative talks on all kinds of Denali-related topics.          Off-Trail Discovery Hikes   If you will be here for several days, consider signing up at the visitor center for an off-trail ranger hike.          Kantishna Experience Tour   This is the only type of bus trip in Denali that features a park ranger, who will join you around the mid-way point of your adventure.                 Other Naturalist and Education Programs Our partner non-profit association, Alaska Geographic, also offers a variety of programs for visitors. Other than field courses, these programs occur at the Murie Science and Learning Center.   Evening speaker series - 7 pm science presentations, multiple evenings per week from late May through early September Side of Science series - 12 pm lunchtime presentations or short films with a park science focus, daily from June through August Field courses - Multi-day, hands-on field courses instructed by park scientists and talented educators, June through September  Ranger Programs: Frequency and Start Dates    Time  Program Name  Frequency  Location   8 am  Discovery Hike  Daily, starting June 8  Varies   10 am  Nature Walk  Daily, starting May 15 Denali Visitor Center    10 am  Sled Dog Demonstration  Daily, May 20 - Sep 15  Park Kennels*   10 am  Chalet ProgramMondays only, May 23 - Sep 14  McKinley Chalet Resort***12 pm  Alpine Hike  Daily, Jun 1 - Sep 14  Eielson Visitor Center**    1 pm  Hike to the Park Kennels  Daily, starting June 1   Denali Visitor Center    1 pm  Eielson Stroll  Daily, Jun 1 - Sep 14  Eielson Visitor Center**    2 pm  Sled Dog Demonstration  Daily, May 15 - Sep 20  Park Kennels*    3:30 pm  Chalet Program Tue - Sat, May 18 - Sep 20  McKinley Chalet Resort***4 pm  Sled Dog Demonstration  Daily, Jun 1 - Sep 5  Park Kennels*    7:30 pm  Riley Creek Campground Program  Daily, starting date May 20 - ending Sep 14  Riley Creek Campground    7:30 pm  Savage River Campground Program  Daily, starting date May 20 - ending Sep 14  Savage River Campground    7:30 pm  Teklanika River Campground  Daily, starting date May 20 - ending Sep 14  Teklanika River Campground    7:30 pm  Wonder Lake Campground  Daily, Jun 8 - Sep 14  Wonder Lake Campground      Notes: Programs entail being at the proper location at the times indicated. * Getting to the kennels typically involves arriving at the Denali Visitor Center 45 minutes before a sled dog demo begins.** Programs at Eielson Visitor Center require a shuttle bus trip of roughly four hours, so choose a departure that gets you to the facility before a given program is set to begin.  *** The Chalet Amphitheater is located outside of the park. To get there you can take a free shuttle from the Denali Visitor Center or drive a private vehicle to the McKinley Chalet Resort, about 1.5 miles north of the park entrance on Highway 3.       Hike with a Ranger Each summer, Denali rangers lead a variety of walks and hikes. In some programs, the group hikes on trails, while others - our off-trail \"Discovery Hikes\" - occur in the wilderness and are comparatively more difficult.    Sit with a Ranger Ranger talks are offered throughout the park. Ranger talks in park campgrounds and visitor centers are a good way to learn more about the park. You should also take in one of our sled dog demonstrations, where a ranger chats about the history and purpose of sled dogs in Denali before hopping on a sled to do a loop around    Ride with a Ranger Twice a day in peak season (June 8 - mid-September), rangers join visitors who are on a Kantishna Experience Tour. The ranger joins you at Wonder Lake and is with you for a few hours in the middle of your bus trip.",
