    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Permits & Reservations              Permits & Reservations         General Information  A permit is required for any activity that provides a benefit to an individual, group, or organization, rather than to the park or the public at large. Many of the events that require permits also require some degree of oversight from National Park Service staff.      First Amendment Activities We encourage citizens to exercise rights guaranteed by the Constitution. However, the courts have recognized that activities associated with the exercise of these rights may be reasonably regulated to protect the public and park resources. Therefore, such First Amendment activities involving over 25 participants require special use permits, and National Park Service staff may regulate the time, place, and manner in which they are conducted. Some examples are:    Distribution and\/or sale of printed matter Religious services Public demonstrations or assemblies, etc. Collecting signatures for petitions  View and print the Special Use Permit Instructions and Requirements for African Burial Ground (PDF-300KB)  View and print the Special Use Permit Application for African Burial Ground (PDF-604KB)       Commercial Filming and Photography  Non-commercial filming and photography is allowed.
