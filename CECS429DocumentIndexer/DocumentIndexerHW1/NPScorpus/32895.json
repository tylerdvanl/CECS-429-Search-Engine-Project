    "body": "Explore This Park    Get Involved     Volunteer     Pathways for Youth     Wilderness School                Wilderness School        Wilderness School (WS) is a work-in-progress youth summer program. Right now, Olympic is collaborating with park partners, NatureBridge and the Student Conservation Association (SCA), to provide a group of high school youth from diverse local communities in Washington State with a life-changing experience at our park. Youth and their leaders will live and work for two weeks increasing their environmental and historical knowledge of this iconic park while participating in conservation and environmental science projects. In doing so, they will develop deep personal connections with Olympic NP and hopefully return for years to come as park stewards. \"[I]t's made me realize how much I love the outdoors and makes me want to get back out to the woods as soon as possible. [A]lso, it made me view the world differently.\" - SCA Crew Member Sara Wall, speaking of her experience last summer at Olympic NP. This program is a natural progression of Pathways for Youth at Olympic National Park. Accomplished WS students are on the right track to complete their senior culminating project (Marine Debris Ambassadors or Adopt-A-Trail Youth Crew) at Olympic and eventually move into volunteer internships and seasonal employment with the National Park Service. Check back for updates on this program. As funding becomes available, we will announce an application deadline.",
