    "body": "The National Register of Historic Places       Over three hundred of Shenandoah National Park ’s structures are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. These vary from architect-designed buildings such as Big Meadows and Massanutten Lodges, to bridges, stone-lined ditches, log comfort stations, and small-scale retaining walls and culverts. For a structure to be considered of national significance it must relate to the broad themes of American history, be of architectural note, or be associated with a figure or event of national importance. These criteria must be justified in a statement of significance in the National Register nomination. Following are the statements of significance for Shenandoah’s historic resources, all of national significance.
