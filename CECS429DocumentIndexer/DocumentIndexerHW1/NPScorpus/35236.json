There is a drink machine at the visitor center, but you can do your part to help reduce waste by purchasing a reusable water bottle at the visitor center (open year-round) and filling at water bottle filling stations located in the park. There are also snacks available at the visitor center.   There is one developed and two primitive campgrounds available in Capitol Reef National Park. Please see Camping in Capitol Reef for more information.  There are many options for dining in the local area. Please visit the Wayne County, Utah Office of Tourism page for more information.",
