The collection consists of published material, including books, pamphlets, and audiovisual material. Borrowing privileges for park staff must be approved by the library manager. Visitors and non-park researchers are restricted to in-library use of materials and may make an appointment to use the library by calling the Cultural Resources Management staff at (808) 985-6321. We recommend visitors and non-park researchers do initial research at the public library, as their hours and borrowing privileges are more extensive.
