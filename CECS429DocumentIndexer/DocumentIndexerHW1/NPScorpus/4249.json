Matt Johnson  National Park Service reports show that half a million visitors to Biscayne National Park spend $32 million in communities near the park. That spending supports 450 jobs in the local area. The South Florida national parks comprised of Big Cypress National Preserve, Biscayne National Park, Dry Tortugas National Park and Everglades National Park, are visited by 3 million people who spend over $200 million and support 3,248 jobs in the local area. Unlike many parks where visitors are generally confined to roads, trails and developed areas, Biscayne's visitation is much more dispersed. In some ways, that means that overall impacts to the resource by such large numbers of people are spread out and less noticeable. In other ways, it means that just about every part of the park is accessible by some form of boat.
