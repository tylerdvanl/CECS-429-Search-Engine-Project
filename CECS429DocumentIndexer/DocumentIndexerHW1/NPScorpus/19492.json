Plants, animals, rocks, historic sites, and prehistoric sites are protected by law for all to enjoy.  Collecting of anything is prohibited (except designated edibles for personal consumption). Possession or use of metal detectors is prohibited. Littering is prohibited. Picking up after those less considerate is encouraged. Glass is prohibited within 100 feet of the river, its tributaries, and in caves. Bring drinks, food, and condiments in non-glass containers. Stay on hiking trails. Avoid short cuts that create erosion and harm plants. If stepping off trail is unavoidable, don't trample lichens or delicate plants. Bicycles are not permitted on trails. ATVs and similar off-road vehicles are prohibited in the park. Excessive noise lessens the likelihood of spotting wildlife. Have fun, but respect others. Trees, other vegetation, & rocks have rights, too. Never carve in bark, which increases likelihood of disease. Leave wildflowers for all to enjoy. Picking a flower ends its cycle so it produces no seeds for next year. Graffiti does not enhance the natural beauty of rocks or bluffs. Help protect your park by reporting violations to a park ranger.   Legal regulations while floating are found on the River Rules page.",
