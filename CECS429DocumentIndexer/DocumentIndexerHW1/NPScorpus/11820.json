The snail accumulates in extraordinarily large densities, choking out other aquatic species and depleting primary producers, such as algae and phytoplankton. The snails can travel in the guts of birds, on hiking equipment and in contaminated waters brought by the shipping industry.         What can you do! Leave behind all fishing and aquatic equipment used in areas harboring New Zealand mudsnails. Be sure to decontaminate fishing and hiking gear to prevent further spread when fishing or hiking in any aquatic environments.",
