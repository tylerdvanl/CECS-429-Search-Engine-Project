Today, the program has grown in a big way, and we currently divert about 24% of the total waste generated in the park, or about 136 tons a year, and we're hoping to nearly double that rate of recycling by 2016. We recycle glass, cardboard, paperboard, mixed paper, aluminum, steel, tin, and plastics #1 and #2. From our maintenance facilities, we also collect car and truck tires, used motor oil, batteries, steel, brush and yard clippings. You can find recycling containers at every visitor center and at Cottonwood, Rio Grande Village, and Chisos Basin campgrounds.         Recycling Fast Facts How much water do we save by recycling one ton of paper?
