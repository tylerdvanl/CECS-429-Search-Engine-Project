[NPS-WESF, RG-79, Box 10, File 1115-30-10, \"Executive Mansion Grounds,\" \"National Community Christmas Tree - 1941\".] The move from the Ellipse to the south lawn of the White House was the direct result of President Roosevelt's idea that the \"proper place for the tree is right next to the fence at the south end of the White House grounds.\" [NPS-WESF, RG-79, Box 10, File 1115-30-10, \"Executive Mansion Grounds,\" memo from Roosevelt to Colonel Starling, May 21, 1941.] The President did not like the 1939 and 1940 location on the Ellipse, and at the lighting of the tree in 1940, he invited the public to \"Come into my yard\" the following year, thus making for a more \"homey\" celebration. [Evening Star, December 25, 1940.] According to the President's directions, \"the crowd would come in from through the East Gate and the West Gate but would be roped off from the White House.... The Chairman, the two clergymen and I will speak from the South Portico and I will press the button from there.\" [NPS-WESF, RG-79, Box 10, File 1115-30-10, \"Executive Mansion Grounds,\" memo from Roosevelt to Starling, May 21, 1941.] The public was admitted to the grounds until the 1950 celebration. During the Truman and first year of the Eisenhower administrations the President spoke from the stands on the south lawn. Two live, 25-foot Oriental spruces to be used in alternate years were moved from another location within the White House grounds and were planted within the iron fence south of the fountain in the grounds, each about twenty-five feet off the White House-Jefferson Memorial Axis. [NPS-WESF, RG-79, Box 10, File 1115-30-10, \"Executive Mansion Grounds,\" memo from Gillen to Starling, June 19, 1941.] The trees were planted 100 feet from the south fence [NPS-WESF, RG-79, Box 10, File 1115-30-10, \"Executive Mansion Grounds,\" \"National Community Christmas Tree 1941.], about 1,000 feet from the South Portico. [Washington Post, December 24, 1941.] Stands for invited guests were erected 200 feet south of the South Portico, facing different directions in different years. These stands were for seating invited guests and members of the chorus. The remainder of the public stood along a cable barricade to the east, west, and south of the stands. [NPS-WESF, RG-79, Box 10, File 1115-30-10, \"Executive Mansion Grounds,\" \"National Community Christmas Tree 1941.] All traffic was suspended in the Ellipse while the southeast and southwest gates of the White House grounds were open. [Washington Post, December 24, 1941.] The National Community Christmas Tree ceremony remained at this location until the move to the Ellipse in 1954 with the creation of the Christmas Pageant of Peace. The east tree is still extant (1998).             1941 December 24 Roosevelt President and Participants: From the South Portico of the White House, President Roosevelt addressed the crowd and lit the tree shortly after 5:00 p.m. As the lighting of the National Community Christmas Tree in 1941 occurred only weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was in Washington to discuss wartime strategy with the President. The Prime Minister attended the event and after the President's greeting, gave another Christmas address. District of Columbia Commissioner Guy Mason presided at the ceremony and gave introductory remarks. [Washington Post, December 21, 1941.] The Tree: Living, 30-foot Oriental spruce (1941). President Roosevelt lit the east tree of the two spruces that had been moved from elsewhere on the White House grounds and placed 100 feet from the south fence of the grounds. [Evening Star, December 25, 1941; NPS-WESF, RG-79, Box 10, File 1115-30-10, \"Executive Mansion Grounds,\" \"National Community Christmas Tree -- 1941\".] The tree was decorated in red, white and blue by the Electric Institute of America, assisted by Community Center Department, D.C. Public Schools and National Capital Parks, National Park Service. [NPS-WESF, RG-79, Box 10, File 1115-30-10, \"Executive Mansion Grounds,\" \"National Community Christmas Tree -- 1941\".] Noteworthy Ceremony Elements: The White House grounds were not open to the public until 4:30 p.m. for security reasons. In order to enter the grounds, the public was required to \"check all packages with soldiers outside the Executive Mansion grounds\" and pass through an \"electric searcher.\" [NPS-WESF, RG-79, Box 10, File 1115-30-10, \"Executive Mansion Grounds,\" \"National Community Christmas Tree -- 1941\"; Washington Post, December 24 and 25, 1941.] A local Boy Scout and Girl Scout delivered the greetings of the people of Washington, and Christmas carols were led by choristers from eight different churches. As part of the program, the Women's Council of the Washington Federation of Churches erected over 200 Christmas trees in the inhabited alleys of Washington. The Washington Post distributed thousands of leaflets containing the words to the carols to be sung at the lighting of the tree.

Public Schools; National Capital Parks, National Park Service; American Forestry Association; and Greater National Capital Committee of the Washington Board of Trade.

[Washington Times, December 25, 1942.] Due to security concerns, the tree was not lit. Because of wartime restrictions, no new ornaments were purchased for the National Community Christmas Tree. [NPS-WESF, RG-79, Box 10, File 1115-30-10, \"Executive Mansion Grounds,\" letter from Bartlett to Kelly, December 14, 1942; Evening Star, December 13, 1942.] However, ornaments (excluding lights) from previous years were reused. In addition, Washington school children donated old ornaments, a program that provided a new way for children to participate in the celebration. [Evening Star, December 13, 1942.] American-made, large, ball-type ornaments were preferred by those in charge of decoration. [D.C. Public Library, Washingtoniana Division, D.C. Community Archives, Collection 37, National Christmas Tree.] Noteworthy Ceremony Elements: While no lights were used in the interests of security, under the suggestion of the Electric Institute of Washington, for the sake of providing continuity in the use of the engraved switchbox, the President used the switchbox symbolically. The only result of his turning the switch was the sounding of the chimes heard by those present and the radio audience. [NPS-WESF, RG-79, Box 10, File 1115-30-10, \"Executive Mansion Grounds,\" letter from Bartlett to Kelly, December 12, 1942; Evening Star, December 25, 1942.] The ceremony was held at its earliest time, beginning at 3:30 p.m. with the U.S. Marine Band concert.

By decision of the executive committee, Washington school children again contributed decoration for the tree. Ornaments were collected through the schools by D.C. Recreation Department. Each of the roughly 1,500 ornaments collected honored a relative or friend serving in the Armed Forces. [NPS-WESF, RG-79, Box 10, File 1115-30-10, \"Executive Mansion Grounds,\" letter from Gartside, December 31, 1943; Evening Star, December 19, 1943; Evening Star, December 22, 1943.] The decorations were removed from the tree earlier than usual, on December 29.

S. Navy School of Music and a chorus of WAVES, Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service, sung Christmas carols. [Evening Star, December 19, 1943.] Miscellaneous: In early December, District of Columbia Commissioners suggested that the community Christmas tree celebration be canceled due to war restrictions. [Evening Star, December 6, 1943.] They cited lighting restrictions and the scarcity of decorations, and said that such a celebration would be \"inconsistent with requests to commercial establishments and others to conserve electricity and would add to overcrowding of streetcars and streets.\" [Washington Post, December 7, 1943.] One newspaper reported prematurely that the White House had announced the cancellation of the event to conserve transportation and energy. [Evening Star, December 9, 1943.] Mrs. Roosevelt is thought to have insisted on the event occurring.[D.C. Public Library, Washingtoniana Division, D.C.

Recreation Department and National Capital Parks, National Park Service, decorated the tree. Since the trees planted in 1941 had become damaged by use, there was a suggestion that artificial trees be substituted for the live Oriental spruces planted in 1941. The American Forestry Association opposed the plan. Noteworthy Ceremony Elements: This was the first year that the ceremony was televised. However, the telecast was not widespread. In addition to the existing committees for the National Community Christmas Tree, a television and broadcasting committee was formed.
