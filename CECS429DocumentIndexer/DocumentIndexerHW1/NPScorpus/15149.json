Trout have not been stocked in the park since the 1980s, but a healthy population of these fiesty fish still remain in many lakes and streams (though not in all of them). Manzanita Lake is famous for its large rainbow and brown trout, but keep in mind it is catch and release only and you must use single-hook, barbless, artificial lures only. Butte Lake and Horseshoe Lake both have healthy populations of trout. A valid California fishing license is required to fish in the park, and please keep the regulations below in mind before wetting your line in the park. The following areas are closed to all fishing during the periods indicated:   Manzanita Creek above Manzanita Lake - closed all year Manzanita Lake shore from the boat launch northwest to 150 feet west of the present inlet and 150 feet at the apex of a radius from the center of the inlet - closed all year Butte Lake boat launch - closed all year  Juniper Lake boat launch - closed all year * Download a list of park fishing regulations and information.",
