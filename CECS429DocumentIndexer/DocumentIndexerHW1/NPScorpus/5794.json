It was rather eye-catching from the road due to the passenger plane mounted to its roof as decoration. It was eventually purchased by the National Park Service in the 1980s, to be used as a visitor center. Today, the building serves as the Oasis Visitor Center. Inside, there are exhibits related to the natural and cultural history of the preserve, educational materials, sales items, and an introductory film.
