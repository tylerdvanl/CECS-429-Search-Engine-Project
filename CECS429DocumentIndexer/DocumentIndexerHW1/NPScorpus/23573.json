NPS Photo.   Fort Union National Monument Fort Union is only about one hour's drive from our door to theirs. If you have an interest in the Santa Fe Trail, western settlement, or U.S. military history, the site is worth a visit.  In April 1851, Lt. Col. Edwin V. Sumner, commanding Military Department No. 9, was under orders \"to revise the whole system of defense\" in the New Mexico Territory. He moved the Union supply depot from Santa Fe, which he called \"that sink of vice and extravagance,\" to a site near the Mountain and Cimarron branches of the Santa Fe Trail. From 1851-1891, Fort Union functioned as an agent of political and cultural change in New Mexico and throughout the Southwest.",
