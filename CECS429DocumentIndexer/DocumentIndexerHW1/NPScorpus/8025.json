Ninety-eight percent of our electricity already comes from hydroelectric power supplied to us, but we're going beyond that. The Logan Pass Visitor Center now obtains all of its necessary electricity from over 3600 watts of solar panels located throughout the Logan Pass area. We're also incorporating more vehicles that run on biodiesel or hybrid models. In the long run, these changes will reduce our carbon footprint and put us in a great position when non-renewable sources of energy become more limited.  Â     Logan Pass Solar Panels NPS Photo",
