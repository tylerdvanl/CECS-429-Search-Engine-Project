However, several public and private campgrounds and RV parks are within one hour's drive of the park. The closest public campgrounds are Oliver Lee State Park, about 24 miles southeast, and Aguirre Springs Recreation Area, about 39 miles southwest. In the summer, the Lincoln National Forest has several campgrounds in the Sacramento Mountains, about 40 miles east of the Monument. For more information on area camping.....
