    "body": "Permits & Reservations       Special Use Permits  Certain types of activities require a special use permit. These include many types of organized gatherings, distribution of printed material and other public expressions of opinion, and other activities that are controlled or prohibited. See the Special Use Permit section to determine if your use might be included.   Commercial Use Authorizations  Commercial Use Authorizations are issued to provide commercial services to park area visitors in limited circumstances. CUAs, although used to authorize commercial services to park area visitors, are not Concession Contracts. They are intended to provide a simple means to authorize suitable commercial services to visitors in park areas in the limited circumstances in the legislation.  Commercial Filming & Photography    The National Park Service encourages filming and photography when it will promote the protection and public enjoyment of park resources, provided that the activity does not violate certain regulations set in place by park management. Contact the Special Park Uses Coordinator at (520) 366-5515 for additional information.",
