That will greatly help in keeping you safe! Heat Even though our trails are short, water is a big issue in Chaco Canyon. We are also at 6200 ft of elevation, and people lose water more quickly, the higher in altitude they are.   On hot, dry, summer days, you should drink 1 quart of water per hour of hiking. Our humidity in the desert is low. You may be dehydrated and not even realize it. Drinking water before hiking can help reduce the risk of dehydration, as well as drinking during the hike (don't wait until you feel thirsty). Bring Electrolyte replacements such as salty snacks, (your body can not only suffer from lack of water, but lack of sodium electrolytes as well.)",
