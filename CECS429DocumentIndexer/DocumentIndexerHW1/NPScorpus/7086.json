    "body": "Cars and Private Vehicles       Theodore Roosevelt National Park offers paved scenic drives in the North and South Units of the park. Unless otherwise posted, the speed limit through the park is 25 mph. Please drive with caution, as our park road is used by vehicles large and small, bicyclists, pedestrians, and park wildlife. Entrance to the South Unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park is located directly off of Interstate 94 in Medora (exits 24 and 27). Here you will find our South Unit Visitor Center and the start of the 36-mile Scenic Loop Drive. Travel time around the loop is about 90 minutes, and offers outstanding views of the badlands, prairie dog towns, and abundant wildlife watching. The Painted Canyon Visitor Center is located directly on I-94 (exit 32), and is open seasonally (generally May - October). Access to the North Unit is on U.S. Highway 85, just north of the Little Missouri River crossing.  The entrance is about 15 miles south of Watford City, ND and 52 miles north of Belfield, ND. The North Unit's 14-mile scenic drive follows the north rim of the Little Missouri River Valley, offering spectacular views and wildlife viewing opportunities. Drive time from the entrance to the end of the park road and back generally takes just over one hour. There are restrooms at the picnic areas of both the North and South Units. No services are available inside of the park. Gasoline and food are available near the South Unit entrance in Medora and along I-94 in the nearby communities of Belfield, ND and Beach, ND.
