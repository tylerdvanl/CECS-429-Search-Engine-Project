    "body": "To Original Route Sign              These road signs guide visitors to segments of the original route (of the historic trail) that already have Original Route signs in place. These signs cannot be used if the historic route has not been signed with Original Route signs. They should ensure that the general public has sufficient guidance so they can easily follow and locate the original route.      Give careful thought to intersections and motorist decision points to make sure visitors are going in the right direction. If long distances of the original route occur, place enough signs along the road to ensure periodic confirmation of the route.      Other Sign Web Pages: Auto Tour Route Local Tour Route Crossing Original Route Original Route Next XX Miles Original Route BEGIN Original Route END Historic Site Name Site Identification - Entrance",
