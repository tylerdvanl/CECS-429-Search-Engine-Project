The river is the southern most trout river in the United States. Buford Dam, at Lake Lanier, releases cold water from the bottom of the lake making the habitat conducive for trout. The Georgia Department of Natural Resources stocks the river with brown, rainbow and brook trout. For a list of fish species found in the park visit the NPSpecies page.
