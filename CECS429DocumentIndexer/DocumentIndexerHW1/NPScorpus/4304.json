With almost all of the park covered by water, people were literally and figuratively constrained by the sea. Some lived within those constraints. Most who spent any length of time here adapted to the often-difficult conditions. Others manipulated the land to suit their own needs, and as a result, thrived. Though little tangible evidence remains from most of these \"manipulators,\" what does remain offers an opportunity to travel back in time and become immersed in Biscayne's special places.",
