    "body": "Elwha Restoration Plans          Overview: The upcoming removal of two dams on the Elwha River is just one of the many steps towards eventual ecosystem restoration. Elwha River Restoration encompasses a number of important projects in a range of disciplines. Flood protection, sensitive species management, sediment management, restoration of anadromous fish stocks, and revegetation are all important aspects of the complete restoration of the Elwha River and ecosystem surrounding dam removal. The construction of two water treatment facilities, completed in 2010, were two of the largest mitigation projects and ensure that water for human needs is protected during and after dam removal.          This webpage was made possible in part by a grant from Washington’s National Park Fund.",
