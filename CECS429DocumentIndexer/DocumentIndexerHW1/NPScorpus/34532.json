(pdf 214kb)             Instructional Teacher Workshops   The instructional teacher workshops take teachers out of the classroom and into the outdoor world they will explore with their students. Workshop attendance is required before participating in a curriculum-based education program.    At the workshops, park rangers familiarize teachers with the field trip site and demonstrate the activities planned for students. They explain what is expected of teachers, rangers, students, and chaperons on field trips. Rangers also provide information for completing classroom pre-visit and post-visit activities. Workshops ensure that teachers and their students get the most out of the field trip to Shenandoah National Park. Workshops may satisfy school district requirements for developmental training and recertification points.   Kindergarten and 1st grade Teacher Workshop is offered periodically.    2nd - 6th grade Teacher Workshop is offered annually, usually in September.  Click for 2016 Workshop Announcement flyer here.
