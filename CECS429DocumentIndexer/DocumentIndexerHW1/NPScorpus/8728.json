Volunteer Over the last few years, volunteers have contributed over 50,000 hours removing nonnative plant species, monitoring wildlife, providing information to visitors, working at the Au Sable Light Station, protecting the resources, and clearing and maintaining the trails.   Purchase merchandise from the park's bookstores, managed by Eastern National. Proceeds from merchandise sales go toward interpretive projects and education programs at Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore.   Donate to the National Parks of Lake Superior Foundation, a nonprofit organization working in coordination with four National Park Service areas to fund preservation projects and education programs.   Donate directly to Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. You may choose to earmark your gift for a specific purpose, or place it in the Superintendent's Donation account.   Leave No Trace. Take only pictures, leave only footprints. Learn how to enjoy your park while leaving it in as good as, if not better, condition as you found it.  Share your ideas on how the parks can best be managed so as to preserve them unimpaired for future generations.   Â    \"...to promote and regulate the use of the...national parks...which purpose is to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\"  National Park Service Organic Act, 16 U.S.C.",
