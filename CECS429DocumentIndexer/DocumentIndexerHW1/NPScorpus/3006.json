    "body": "13 - Hands-on Area       This area provides a different type of museum experience. On the left is a working telegraph key and sounder. Try your hand at \"sending\" a message with the dots and dashes of Morse Code. For more information about the telegraph key, follow this link to its page in the Cultural History Mystery answers. Or, finish the museum tour and do the whole Cultural History Mystery.      On the counter in the back are family histories of some of the people who spent time at Pipe Spring. Some of the quotes in the museum came from those histories. Rangers and volunteers use the information to provide a better picture of life at Pipe Spring. Visitors are welcome to spend time perusing these personal histories.  The table to the right has changing objects to touch and play with. Most commonly it has a variety of pioneer children's toys.              LEFT: Simulated Battery   MIDDLE: Sounding Unit   RIGHT: Telegraph Key        << back      continue >>",
