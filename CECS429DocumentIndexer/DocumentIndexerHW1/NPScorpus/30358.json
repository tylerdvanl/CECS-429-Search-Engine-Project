Some farmers joined the Countryside Initiative with a long history of agricultural work in their families, while others joined the program with no history of farming life. Eleven farms currently operate as part of the Countryside Initiative program, each at a different stage of development. As part of their commitment to run a successful farm, Countryside Initiative farmers continue their education through courses offered by the Cuyahoga Valley Countryside Conservancy and other organizations. These farmers face daily challenges related to learning and conducting general farming practices, as well as aligning their work with the sustainability goals of the national park.          In Their Own Words Click the topics to hear stories about Cuyahoga Valley life.
