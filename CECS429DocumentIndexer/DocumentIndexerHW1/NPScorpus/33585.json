    "body": "Salamanders         An adult newt, out of the water, and hunting for prey. Andrew Hoffman  Eastern red-spotted newt After a 'gully washer' rain storm, you may be lucky enough to see many newts crossing the trails. Depending on the age, some will be at the terrestrial stage, called 'red efts.' Older newts are aquatic and an olive green color with red spots, but will get washed up on land after a hard rain. The adults are fun to catch with a dip net, but must always be returned to their habitat unharmed. Eastern red-spotted newts are toxic to predators but harmless to humans. The red color of the young serves as a warning and help protect them from predation.   Â      'Redback' color morph of adult eastern red-backed salamader. Andrew Hoffman  Eastern Red-Backed Salamander The most common salamander in our area is the eastern red-backed. Although many in number, this species is unique for several reasons. First of all, this species is totally lacking lungs, breathing through its moist skin for respiration. In addition, it occurs in two different color forms. The 'redbacks' are grey with either a red or yellowish stripe down the back, and the 'leadbacks' are a solid dark grey with no striping. Lastly, red-backs hatch from the egg as adults, skipping the juvenile stage entirely.       Up close and personal with a marbled salamander. Andrew Hoffman  Marbled Salamander Marbled salamanders are a sight to behold in the Piedmont forest. They are rather stocky but can reach almost 5 inches in length. Their moist skin is black with the females having silvery bands all down their body, while the male's bands look more whitish. Their aquatic larvae are easily seen because they are the only ones active in the icy cold of winter.",
