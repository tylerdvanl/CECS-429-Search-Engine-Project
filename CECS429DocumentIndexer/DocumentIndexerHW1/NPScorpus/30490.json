Ice Box Cave: Bat Population Threatened Ice Box Cave, located at Ritchie Ledges, is closed in an effort to slow the spread of white-nose syndrome (WNS), a fungal disease that has killed millions of bats in the northeastern and eastern U.S. and threatens our bat population in Cuyahoga Valley National Park. WNS is spread by bat-to-bat transmission and by humans transporting fungal spores on their shoes, clothes, and other gear from contaminated sites. Help slow the spread of WNS and reduce disturbance to bats by staying out of the cave. Please report any unusual bat activity, such as, bats flying outside during the day in cold winter months or bats clustering near the entrance to the cave.Contact Park Dispatch at 440-546-5945.",
