Even before the establishment of the National Park Service in 1916, citizens were stepping forward to protect special places that exemplify the country's heritage.                   Volunteer-in-Parks The Flight 93 National Memorial already has a rich tradition of citizen involvement. Volunteer \"Ambassadors\" have been greeting visitors to the temporary memorial since 2001. Other volunteers assist with our oral history project or with caring for the tribute collection. Become a volunteer.         Friends of Flight 93 Established in 2009, the Friends of Flight 93 National Memorial is the official non-profit supporting partner of Flight 93 National Memorial.
