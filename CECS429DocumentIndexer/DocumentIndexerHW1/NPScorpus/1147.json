The drive to Hilina Pali Overlook is 9 miles (14.5 km). Hilina Pali Overlook is approximately 2,282 ft (695.6 m) in elevation and over 12 miles (19.3 km) long. The last lava flow in this area was about 650 years ago. On the drive down the Hilina Pali Road, you will see native ‘ōhi‘a trees and native under brush. On the left side of your drive, about .9-3.5 miles (1.4-5.6 km) down, you will view the Koaʻe Fault. The Koaʻe fault is known as a \"reversed or backward fault\" (upper section\/wedge, between rift zones and caldera, slips down into the void, therefore inland facing fault scarp\/pali called Kulanaʻokuaiki). The Koaʻe fault lies between the east\/southwest rift zone of Kīlauea Volcano. This fault is about 10 miles (16.1 km) long, 1.5 miles (2.4 km) wide and 50 ft. (15.2 meters) high. The fault extension was created by the slippage of the ground between the northern and southern parts of Kīlauea. It is separating about 0.5 inches (12.7mm) –3.0 inches (76.2mm) per year. Note: Hilina Pali is the largest scarp on the south flank of Kīlauea. It's very windy most of the time.        Primitive Camping at Kulanaokuaiki NPS Photo  Kulanaokuaiki Campground Kulana = to rock \/ sway \/ warble O = of Kua = spine Iki = little \/ small Kulanaokuaiki = \"the little trembling spine\" \/ shaking of a sharp ridge  This campground is located about 5 miles down the Hilina Pali Road at 2,700' elevation.
