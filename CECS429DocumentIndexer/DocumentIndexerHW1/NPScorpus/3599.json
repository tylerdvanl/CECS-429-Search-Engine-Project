NPS Photo: Trash Trackers       Page Weather Arizona Weather Utah Weather      The weather in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area is usually typical for the high deserts. Summers are extremely hot with little, if any, shade. Winters are moderately cold with night time lows often below freezing. Spring weather is highly variable and unpredictable with extended periods of winds. Fall weather is usually nice and mild, a great time to beat the heat (and the crowds!).  Temperatures can range from 110° F (38°C) in June & July to O° F (-16°C) in December & January. Precipitation is generally light (less than 6 inches--15.2cm-- annually) though heavy rains and flash flooding is possible during the summer and fall \"monsoons.\"   We recommend lightweight, light colored clothing for summer, including a hat. Layers of clothing are best for other times of the year.               Temperatures Average Average Rain\/ Lake   High Low Snow Surface    January  42F 6C  24F -4C .47 in 1.2 cm 46F 8C    February 51F 11C 30F -1C .43 in 1.1 cm 46F 8C    March 58F 14C 36F 2C .73 in 1.9 cm 54F 12C    April 68F 20C 43F 6C .34 in 0.9 cm 54F 12C    May 80F 27C 53F 12C .43 in 1.1 cm 64F 18C    June 91F 33C 62F 17C .20 in 0.5 cm 71F 22C    July 97F 36C 69F 21C .47 in 1.2 cm 78F 26C    August 94F 34C 67F 19C .67 in 1.7 cm 79F 26C    September 85F 29C 58F 14C .54 in 1.4 cm  74F 23C     October 71F 22C 47F 8C .78 in 2.0 cm 67F 19C    November 55F 13C  35F 2C  .59 in 1.5 cm 61F 16C    December 46F 8C 27F -3C .51 in 1.3 cm 51F 11C",
