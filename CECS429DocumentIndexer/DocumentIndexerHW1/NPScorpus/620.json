Please call the Visitors Center (808) 328-2326 ext. 1702 for more information. Several beach wheelchairs are provided for visitors to comfortably access the Royal Grounds. The landscape of the Pu'uhonua is rocky and has a challenging grade therefore it is recommended that the beach wheelchairs are not used past the Hale o Keawe. The wheelchairs are available at the visitor center during the operating hours of the visitor center (8:30 AM to 4:30 PM) and are free of charge. The chairs have large tires for easy maneuverability through the sand but require the assistance of another person to guide and push the chair.",
