The program will include National Park Service Park Rangers who will supplement Lincoln's remarks with the story of Lincoln's election, the turbulence that followed, and Lincoln's steadfast commitment to the principles of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, despite threats to the nation and himself. The program will also touch on how events of 150 years ago resonated through later generations up to and including today. The National Park Service is presenting these series of events in cooperation with many local cosponsors in each community.   About Abraham Lincoln's February, 1861 Buffalo Visit Abraham Lincoln was elected President of the United States in November 1860. He made a grand one week railway tour from his hometown in Springfield, Illinois to his inauguration in Washington DC, which then took place in March. The trip was scheduled according to a precise timetable agreed upon along the route. The stops were brief and coincided with service requirements of fuel and water for the steam locomotive.   President-elect Abraham Lincoln arrived at the Exchange Street station on February 16, where he was greeted by former President and community leader Millard Fillmore, as well as massive and unruly crowds. Proceeding to the American Hotel in downtown Buffalo, he addressed the public. He faced an awkward challenge since, not yet in office, he had no authority to speak for the government. Confronted with the reality of Southern secession, he needed to also present an air of strength in the face of adversity, yet avoid arousing further animosity. That evening the President-elect greeted visitors at a public reception.  Lincoln chose not to travel on February 17, as it fell on a Sunday. He instead attended worship services at the First Unitarian Church with Fillmore, and spent the afternoon at the Fillmore home. In the evening he attended a lecture at St. James Hall on the plight of Native Americans. He continued his journey the next morning.    About Lincoln Actor Fritz Klein Considered one of the nation's foremost Lincoln actors, Richard F. (Fritz) Klein makes Lincoln and his period of history come alive. Klein was born in 1948 and was raised in Southern California. He graduated from Concordia College in Ft. Wayne, Indiana in 1970 and began acting as a hobby in 1975. The first time he was asked to portray Abraham Lincoln was in 1976 at a municipal celebration of the Nation's bicentennial. Klein now resides in Springfield, Illinois with his wife and family where he performs for some of the city's 500,000 annual visitors. From there he also travels to points across the nation on tours and by special invitation.   The program is presented in Buffalo by the National Park Service and the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site, the only National Park Service location in Western New York. It is co-sponsored by the Unitarian Universalist Church of Buffalo, with assistance by the 155th NY Infantry Re-enactor Regiment, and Echoes Through Time History Center.

Bomar, Director of the National Park Service. “I hope every citizen will visit a presidential site this election year. It is fitting to celebrate the accomplishments of past presidents as we prepare to elect a new one.”    The American Presidents Travel Itinerary features the White House and more than 70 other sites nationwide that are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Almost half of the sites are also part of the National Park System.  The new itinerary is available at http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/history\/nr\/travel\/presidents\/index.html and offers:  Descriptions and significance of each historic site Information and maps for how to visit the sites Contemporary and historic photographs Two essays by highly respected presidential historians A “Learn More” section that includes links to additional information and a bibliography on the presidency and tourism websites to help with trip planning  The American Presidents itinerary is the 47th in the National Park Service’s ongoing Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary Series. The series promotes public awareness of history and encourages visits to historic places throughout the country. All of the itineraries in the series can be found at http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/history\/nr\/travel\/. The National Park Service’s Heritage Education Services produced the itinerary in partnership with the National Park Service Office of Tourism, the White House Historical Association, and the National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers. Staff from many units of the National Park System and the other sites included in the itinerary, State historic preservation offices, and others assisted in developing the content and provided images, making the itinerary a true collaborative effort. 9\/23\/08  Theodore Roosevelt Day in New York State - On September 12, Governor David Paterson signed a proclamation declaring October 27, 2008, the sesquicentennial of TR's birth, to be Theodore Roosevelt Day in New York State. See a copy of the proclamation, or visit the NPS's Theodore Roosevelt Sesquicentennial Website. 3\/4\/08 TR Site Volunteers Bring a Smile to Children In Need Of Courage - The volunteer corps of the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural Site recently completed a special project, the Children’s Courage Campaign. Volunteer Coordinator Liz Krawczyk was inspired by a children’s book featured in the Site’s gift shop, A Little Teddy Roosevelt Learns About Courage. The book, by David Mead and Chris Sharp, is about a young Teddy Roosevelt’s bravery overcoming bad dreams. Teddy learns “...to be courageous in this lighthearted tale featuring clever historical references.” In the story, Teddy is assisted by his own teddy bear. Mrs. Krawczyk’s goal was to create gift bags for children at the Lee Gross Anthone Child Advocacy Center in Buffalo, each bag containing a copy of the heartwarming storybook and a cuddly teddy bear. With her enthusiastic leadership, the Site’s volunteer corps generously contributed to the campaign and recently presented 175 gift bags to the Center. It is their hope that the books and bears will help to lift the spirits of these children in crisis and at the same time introduce the youngsters and their families to Theodore Roosevelt.  2\/2\/08 Site Plans for Spring Groundbreaking - With good progress being made on both the Carriage House Project’s design and the $2.2 million Capital Campaign that will make the project a reality, planning is now underway for a spring 2008 groundbreaking.  With the Campaign nearing its goal, bids have recently gone out for construction. The project includes significant upgrades to the historic Wilcox Mansion including HVAC and electrical improvements, a new fire suppression system, roof replacement, and interior and exterior painting, as well as construction of a new addition adjacent to the Mansion on the footprint of the original Wilcox carriage house. When the project is complete, the entire facility will have universal access thanks to a new elevator, an at-grade main entrance, and an accessible restroom. New and reconfigured space will provide a tremendous opportunity to improve and expand the visitor experience through a new gift shop as well as exciting tour, exhibit, program, and research offerings.        In January, we publicly announced the Site’s closure for regular tours and programs. Before construction can begin, the historic structure needs to be protected, fragile and valuable artifacts removed, the Site’s collection secured, and staff offices relocated. Staff and volunteers are hard at work and making great progress towards this goal. It is projected that the Site will reopen to the public next fall. While the Site is closed for tours, many regular activities are continuing through collaborations with community partners. The Site’s popular fourth grade program is being held at the Buffalo & Erie County Historical Society with the support of staff and volunteers from both organizations. An April lecture featuring Candice Millard, author of the best selling Roosevelt biography, The River of Doubt, is being co-sponsored and hosted by the Buffalo Seminary. Discussions are underway with the Allentown Association on joining forces for an extensive series of summer walking tours and the Site plans to have its usual presence at the Allentown Art Festival, no doubt offering construction updates in addition to lemonade and cookies.  Of course, outreach programs to schools and community groups continue to be available.  Please find additional information on programming throughout this issue.  1\/14\/08 It’s Not Just the Story, but How You Tell It - The saying goes that the more things change, the more they stay the same. Well, the facts of Theodore Roosevelt’s 1901 inauguration haven’t changed in over a century since the event occurred, but what has changed greatly since the Site opened in 1971 are the national philosophies of how museums should communicate their messages, and the means available to help them do so effectively. The 1901 inauguration of TR in Buffalo remains an important story to tell, but the Site is looking to bring our presentation into the new century. When the Site’s renovations are complete, the changes will be far more than brick and mortar. Visitors will be treated to an exciting new experience that will be unlike any museum tour they have previously experienced. For the past year, the TR Site has been redesigning its interpretation and exhibits, in consultation with outside consultants, exhibit designers, volunteers, community representatives, and Roosevelt scholars, to place increased emphasis on national themes, including the broad impact of Theodore Roosevelt’s presidency upon the nation, and the relevance of his presidency to our lives today. The Site regards its use of guided tours as a valued part of the Site experience that it is vital to retain. Museum consultant Linda Norris has been employed to assist the Site in creating a new and dramatic approach to our guided tour which will transport visitors back to 1901. The new tour will incorporate new audio technology and a “storytelling” approach to make the tale of the inauguration more personal and relatable, and incorporate current standards for quality interpretation. A prototype tour was tested with a focus group in January, receiving high marks from the focus group and providing much information for further refinement. While guided tours will remain central to the Site, new exhibits are also under development, with the Site exploring options for some self-guided experiences that will allow visitors to explore secondary aspects of the Site’s story in greater depth. This will allow visitors to shape their own experience by choosing what topics they want to know more about, and to have some control over the length of their visit. This will permit the Site to meet a broader range of visitor interests, and will be in keeping with current interpretation philosophy to encourage and empower visitors to make their own meaning. The Site tested some aspects of planned exhibits with the January focus group, and is currently in the process of selecting an exhibit designer to assist in the process. Our initiative is also focusing on educational offerings. A volunteer committee composed of retired teachers is currently developing lesson plans to accompany the Site’s traveling trunks, a project which will make the trunks a ready-to-use resource for classroom teachers. Initial plans are also underway to develop new educational programming for several grade levels to accompany the updated tour experience and exhibits.  Some things will be changing in stimulating ways, but the Site is striving to keep all the things that visitors have always loved about the Site. The ways in which our story is told will be changing, with the incorporation of new techniques, new technology, and most especially, new excitement. The story, however, will stay the same. We promise. TR still gets to be president.  1\/3\/08 Letter from the President and Executive Director - Dear Members, Volunteers and Friends, The $2.2 million Capital Campaign that was launched two years ago is nearing completion. The Campaign “went public” at a wonderful reception on November 29th, which also kicked off our Victorian Christmas event. The Capital Campaign thermometer was unveiled on the front lawn featuring our own Rough Rider tallying progress on his Big Stick!  With many major gifts secured, we are now asking the general public to help us push the Campaign over the top.  At the reception on the 29th, it was wonderful to have representatives with us from several of the local foundations providing major contributions to the Campaign. These and additional foundations are helping to make our goal of an improved facility a reality, along with the leadership support of the National Park Service, New York State Senators Mary Lou Rath and Dale Volker, the TR Site Foundation Board of Trustees, the Site’s amazing volunteer corps, and our loyal members. The support for the project has been tremendous. Thank You! As always, please contact either of us with your questions or comments. Lawrence D. Seymour, President, Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural Site Foundation Molly Quackenbush, Executive Director, Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural Site Foundation   12\/27\/07 Victorian Christmas - Once again, heartiest congratulations are in order! Victorian Christmas 2007 was a fantastic and highly successful holiday event. Every inch of the Site was filled with the sights, sounds and feelings of an old-fashioned Christmas and as always, the perfect way to begin the festive season was to visit the TR Site.  Eighth District Federated Garden Clubs of New York State did a remarkable job of turning the house into a “winter wonderland” and visitors enjoyed all their favorite Victorian Christmas traditions. Of course, we had many reasons to celebrate this year and there was plenty of excitement in the air at the gala opening reception. A capacity crowd was on hand as Site trustees shared wonderful news about the Carriage House project and unveiled a larger-than-life life image of Theodore Roosevelt, the Rough Rider and champion of the Capital Campaign, on the front lawn. We look forward to moving up the last few inches on TR’s Big Stick and closing the campaign in the coming weeks.   2008 promises to be quite a year filled with exciting challenges and wonderful new beginnings for the Site. Volunteer committees are hard at work planning for a very bright future and their expectations are high. We are certain that the best is yet to come – stay tuned for news of Victorian Christmas 2008!  2007 Victorian Christmas Committee Barbara B.

The meeting was made possible by a generous grant from the New York Council for the Humanities, a state affiliate of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). Skillfully facilitated by museum consultant Linda Norris, the focus group included not only Site staff and volunteers, but also members of the community and noted TR scholar Kathleen Dalton (author of Theodore Roosevelt: A Strenuous Life). Since the focus group’s meeting, staff has been working with Linda Norris to further the Site’s exciting new exhibit plan. Moreover, she will be helping the Site to develop integrated educational programming and advising staff on several other related projects. This partnership will provide the TR Site with the tools it needs to move forward and create public programming as engaging as the Carriage House itself.  9\/15\/07 Site Welcomes IMLS Director - The Site was honored to welcome a special guest at this year’s inaugural reenactment and citizen naturalization ceremony on September 14. Dr. Anne-Imelda Radice, Director of the Institute of Museum and Library Services, returned to her hometown of Buffalo to take part in the ceremony at the Site. The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) is the premier independent federal agency that supports the nation’s museums and libraries.    Dr. Radice’s remarks centered on the importance of all citizens getting involved in the life of their communities. She particularly applauded our region’s wealth of cultural institutions and libraries that add so much to Western New York’s quality of life. She encouraged everyone to support and take full advantage of these rich resources.   9\/14\/07 Levy and Ritchie Honored - On September 14, as the TR Site marked the 106th anniversary of the inauguration of Theodore Roosevelt in Buffalo, the Exemplary Citizenship Award and the Police Award were presented at a luncheon at the Adam’s Mark Hotel with 225 supporters in attendance. The 2007 recipients are both inspiring examples of perseverance and integrity. The Theodore Roosevelt Exemplary Citizenship Award is presented annually to an individual whose life and work reflect the ideals and spirit of our 26th President, including a strong devotion to the betterment of the community, daring and unselfish leadership, and contributions that are inspirational to any and every American. For most Western New Yorkers, the name of the 2007 recipient, Marv Levy, is synonymous with leadership. As Head Coach of the Buffalo Bills from 1986-97, Mr. Levy led the team to four consecutive Super Bowl appearances, four AFC titles and six AFC East crowns. During his tenure as coach, the Bills made eight playoff appearances in eleven years, and he became the winningest coach in team history. In 2001 he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Not content to rest upon his laurels however, he continues to guide the team today as General Manager.  The Theodore Roosevelt Association Police Award is presented annually to a police officer who has overcome a handicap, as Theodore Roosevelt triumphed over the physical handicaps of his youth, and who continues to render outstanding service to his\/her police department, as Roosevelt did in his years as president of the Board of Police Commissioners of New York City. The 2007 recipient, K-9 Officer Steven D. Ritchie of the Lockport Police Department, has overcome some tremendous obstacles. In 2003, Off. Ritchie was severely wounded while assisting other officers in apprehending a suspect armed with an assault rifle. He lost signs of life four times before surgery was over, and even after pulling through, faced the expectation of severe and permanent disabilities. Through additional surgery and extensive physical rehabilitation, Off. Ritchie has defied the odds and returned to full-time duty. The Site was also pleased to once again host a naturalization ceremony with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services on September 14. Judge Leslie G. Foschio, U.S. District Court – Western District of New York, who is also a long-time Site trustee, administered the oath of allegiance to twenty-three new citizens from sixteen countries. Honored guest Dr. Anne-Imelda Radice, Director of the Institute of Museum and Library Services,addressed the audience and a reenactment Theodore Roosevelt’s 1901 inauguration was presented by Cindy Abbott-Letro and Frank Rizzo, with John Gurtler in the role of TR.  8\/23\/07 Wilcox Treasures Return “Home” -It has been a pretty exciting year for the TR Site’s collections department. According to the Site’s Curator, Lenora Henson, “In the past six months, we’ve been lucky enough to acquire not one . . . not two . . . but THREE collections of material directly related to Ansley Wilcox and his family!”  Last spring, a Bible that appears to have been a gift to Ansley Wilcox on the occasion of his first marriage, was donated to the Site. Although somewhat tattered, the Bible is a beautiful volume; Wilcox’s name is embossed on the front cover and a detailed Family Record is contained within its pages. Over the summer, the Foundation acquired two decorative trays that were Christmas gifts from Ansley Wilcox to his second wife, Mary Grace. Since she received one of the trays in 1890, it is a good bet that it was in the house for TR’s inauguration! More recently, a wonderful collection of Wilcox family photographs and papers was donated. In addition to more than thirty pictures, the collection includes the Wilcoxes’ invitation to the Buffalo memorial service for President William McKinley and three engraved invitations to the White House! These artifacts are amazing additions to the TR Site’s collection and it is thrilling to know that they are finally “back home.” (Update: The above-mentioned Ansley Wilcox Bible was recently evaluated by BuffaloState College’s Art Conservation Department. Working under the supervision of professional conservators, graduate students in the department will treat the Bible—stabilizing its binding and improving the book’s overall aesthetics. This work is being very generously funded by the donor.)  6\/2\/07 Awards Presented - On May 10th, TR Site trustees, staff, and volunteers attended a special reception at The Twentieth Century Club to celebrate the unique alliance we share. The Site was particularly pleased to honor Jane Plimpton Plakias with a special award in recognition of her lifetime service & dedication to the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site.  Mrs. Plakias is the great niece of Ansley Wilcox, and as a child she was a frequent visitor to this home. She has been a passionate supporter of the TR Site since the earliest years and has served as an active trustee since 1991, traveling in from her Washington, D.C. home for meetings. Jane currently serves as Honorary Chair of the Capital Campaign along with Trustee Emeritus, Dr. J. Warren Perry, helping the Site to achieve its next step in its growth.  Board President Lawrence D. Seymour presented the Foundation’s President’s Award to Sheila Hess and Carol Wagner. Carol and Sheila share a special dedication to the TR Site that dates back to their days as members of the Junior League’s 1968 Wilcox Committee which was so instrumental in saving and restoring this national landmark. The “dynamic duo” began their team effort many years ago and that effort continues today. Sheila and Carol recently organized a reunion of the original Wilcox Committee members to encourage the group to renew their commitment to the Site and its exciting plans for the future. They have given countless hours of service on numerous committees and special activities throughout the years. Sheila has been an active Site trustee since 1990, chairing both the membership and annual fund committees. Carol has lent her time and talent to both the Research and Docent committees. Of course, they are both familiar faces during Victorian Christmas and numerous other fundraising events. Congratulations and sincere thanks to Carol and Sheila for your outstanding commitment to the Theodore Roosevelt Site. In today’s society, especially in the “not-for-profit” realm, one of the most important words we hear is collaboration.  This year, the Barbara Berryman Brandt Volunteer Award was presented to two veteran volunteers who are shining examples of what can be accomplished through collaboration. We proudly honor Marcy Holler, Herb and Garden chair, and Dorothy Schaertel, Craft Committee chair, with this special award. Marcy and Dorothy have provided strong, dedicated leadership for their groups, always encouraging the members to work together toward one important goal, the betterment of the TR Site. Their efforts resulted in a very successful new addition to Victorian Christmas. For the first time, the two groups joined forces and combined their wares into one shop, The Snowflake Boutique. Design, set-up, staffing as well as profit sharing were a team effort, receiving rave reviews from the staff and Victorian Christmas patrons. It’s no coincidence that this event is so important to both of these special volunteers, since they were both attracted to the Site by the holiday celebration. Marcy came to help in the gift shop in 1998 and was quickly directed to the Herb and Garden group when her love for gardening became apparent. Dorothy joined in 1995 and her talent and creativity were soon discovered by the Craft group. Both Marcy and Dorothy insisted that they were accepting the volunteer award on behalf of their committee members, so we heartily congratulate all for their dedication and hard work.  5\/10\/07 High School Students Carry On Theodore Roosevelt’s Public Speaking Legacy - The Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site was proud to hold its fourth biennial Theodore Roosevelt Public Speaking Contest for high school students on Sunday, March 25th. The contest commemorates the life and legacy of America’s 26th president, Theodore Roosevelt. Instituted in 2001, with the backing of Foundation Trustee Emeritus Dr. J. Warren Perry, the contest commemorates Theodore Roosevelt’s 1901 inauguration in Buffalo. The development of public speaking expands the academic potential of participants, promotes scholarship, and builds confidence, self-reliance, social awareness and leadership ability, which will help them achieve success in the business and professional world. The contest was open to public, private, parochial, charter, and home school students grades 9-12, throughout Erie and Niagara Counties. The Site was proud to have 25 students from 21 schools register this year. The Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural Site was pleased to have finalists competing from Amherst Central, Canisius High, East Aurora, Hamburg, Lafayette, Lackawanna, West Seneca West, and Williamsville North. Excellent presentations were offered by all contestants, well representing the high quality of Western New York students. Contestants vied for a first place prize of $1,000; second place, $500; and third place, $250. The Site congratulates the winners of the 2007 contest: Ashley N. Alessi, West Seneca West Senior High, first place; Colin M. Knoer, Williamsville North High School, second place; and Harrison I. Singer, Amherst Central High School, third place.  The Site would like to thank sponsors Dr. J. Warren Perry, Paul Ciminelli, and the Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society, which hosted the event. We would also like to thank the many volunteers who made the event a success by their efforts, and all of the students who worked hard to provide many excellent presentations. Most of all, the Site offers its congratulations to the 2007 winners.  4\/12\/07 Art Show - Between April 24 and May 20, 2007, an art show featuring the work of award-winning Western New York artist Frances H. Crohn, will be on display at the Site. This retrospective show will feature a comprehensive collection of drawings and paintings that strike a fine balance between realism and abstraction.
