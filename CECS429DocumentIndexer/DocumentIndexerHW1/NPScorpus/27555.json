    "body": "Scout Hikes          Stones River National Battlefield offers two hikes that let scouts explore their history by answering a series of questions during their visit. After completing their hike, many groups purchase a commemorative patch from our book store to remember their visit. The patches cost $3.95 plus tax. We request that all scout groups contact us before visiting the park. Rangers may offer education programs to scout groups upon request.
