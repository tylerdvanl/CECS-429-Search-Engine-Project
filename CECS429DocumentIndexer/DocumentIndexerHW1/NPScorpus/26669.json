Locations of newts and crayfish in Crater Lake.  Blue circles are newt locations.  Red circles are crayfish locations.  The size of the circles indicates how many animals were found at that location. NPS  The figure shows the distribution of Mazama Newts and crayfish in Crater Lake. The red dots represent locations where crayfish are present and the size of the dot represents how many crayfish were found. The blue dots represent locations where Mazama Newts were found. The Mazama Newt may have colonized Crater Lake as early as 6,000 years ago and most likely spread to live on the entire shoreline of the lake. In recent times the newt populations have been eliminated from certain areas of the shoreline because of the presence of crayfish. Park biologists and outside researchers will continue to monitor the populations of newts and crayfish and develop a plan for saving the Crater Lake Newt.",
