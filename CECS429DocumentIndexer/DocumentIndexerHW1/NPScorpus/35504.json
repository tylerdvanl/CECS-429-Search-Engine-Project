More than any other artist, Moran created popular interest in the Great American West by bringing its vast, unfamiliar landscapes to Americans living in the East. In July of 1873, Moran visited Zion Canyon while traveling with an expedition led by John Wesley Powell. While at Zion, Moran completed a number of sketches and studies of the landscape which inspired him to create illustrations and watercolor paintings of Zion throughout his life. Since Thomas Moran first sketched in the canyon in 1873, Zion has been a serious subject for painters. Artists of every medium and style have been coming to the canyon ever since. Today, that legacy is celebrated each year during the first week of November as two‐dozen excellent artists converge in the canyon for the Zion National Park Plein Air Art Invitational. Over the course of the week‐long event artists paint in various locations in and around the park in preparation for the wet paint sale held at the end of the event.        NPS\/Daren Reel   Artist guidelines during the event include: 1. Artists are encouraged to interact with the public and provide opportunities which promote the history of art at Zion National Park and other significant historic events of the region through dialogue and social media.
