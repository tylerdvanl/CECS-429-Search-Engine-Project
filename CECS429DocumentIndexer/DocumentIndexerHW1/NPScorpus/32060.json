The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service fishery surveys concluded that park aquatic areas serve as important nursery grounds for several important commercial and recreational fish namely - striped bass, Atlantic croaker, American eel, summer flounder, white perch and spot. Recreational fish observed include largemouth bass, channel catfish, yellow perch, sunfish, American shad, Atlantic menhaden, blue catfish, striped bass, bluegill, black crappie, mummichog, inland silverside, gizzard shad, weakfish, Atlantic croaker and southern flounder. This diverse mixture of fishes is typical of upper estuarine habitats due to the seasonal changes in salinity that occur. Water sampling indicates relatively good water quality for the maintenance of diverse fish communities. Park records list 87 species of fish found in its streams, ponds and rivers. Waters in and around the park support oyster beds, crabs, clams, crayfish, perch, bass, sunfish and bluegill.",
