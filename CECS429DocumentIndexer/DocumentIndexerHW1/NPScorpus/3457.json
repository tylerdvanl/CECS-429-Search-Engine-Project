    "body": "Side Canyon Water Quality       A cooperative U.S. Geological Survey and National Park Service study was designed to identify the effects of visitor use on water quality in side canyons. Three canyons, Moqui, Forgotten, and Knowles, were selected because of their similar physical characteristics but varied visitor use. Moqui Canyon is one of the most popular side canyons on the lake and receives a large amount of recreational use, Forgotten Canyon receives a moderate amount of recreational use, and Knowles Canyon was closed to visitor use for the duration of the study. Water quality profiles were conducted along with sampling for nutrients, metals, bacteria, and hydrocarbons at multiple depths and locations throughout these three canyons.
