Most sledders use waxed plastic snow saucers (which can be purchased at the park gift shop). Below are a few tips for having a great time while staying safe.  Choose a dune that is away from the roadway and parking areas and is free of vegetation. Sit or lay on your back on the sled with your feet pointing downhill.  Do not stand up while sledding. The dune sand may be soft, but the area at the base of the dune can be very hard and unintentional injuries are surprisingly common. Do not sled head first.  Do not let young children sled alone.  Children ages 5 to 9 are the most susceptible to injury. Always check for hazards before sledding. Hazards include things like vegetation, rocks, or other obstructions.       Family-Friendly Hikes  The Dune Life Nature Trail is a wonderful family-oriented hike. As you walk the trail, you'll follow Katy the Kit Fox as she explains how she survives in the harsh environment of the dunefield. You'll also learn about many of the animals that make their home among the white sands. The trail is about 1.25 miles in length and takes roughly 40 minutes to complete.   The Interdunal Boardwalk is another great family hike. Interpretive signs will tell you about how plants manage to eke out a living in a seemingly waterless world as you meander along the planked walkway through a pristine interdunal area.
