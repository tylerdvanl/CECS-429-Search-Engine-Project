Park managers use research to make science-based decisions about managing park resources, and scientists use information to further their own research questions. In turn, the public benefits from the insights that provide a better understanding of the natural world. Interest in conducting research at a park is a measure of the scientific significance of park resources, and with over 100 annual permits, Big Bend National Park’s research program is among the most active in the National Park System.",
