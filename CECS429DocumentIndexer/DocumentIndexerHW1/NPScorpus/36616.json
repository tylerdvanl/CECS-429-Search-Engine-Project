Pets are not allowed on any hiking trails or in the visitor center. Pets may accompany visitors in the campground, and at overlooks and pullouts along the paved scenic drives. Pets may be walked on roads or in parking lots, but must be leashed at all times when outside a vehicle. Pets may not be left unattended (except in a paid-for campsite in the Devils Garden campground, where they must not cause a disturbance). Important! The desert can be deadly for pets. Car temperatures rise quickly in the sun, even on cool days. Your pet can easily die of heat exhaustion. If you are leaving a pet in a car, crack the windows as much as possible and leave water to drink. We recommend you not leave pets in the car when temperatures are above 68 degrees, even with the windows cracked.
