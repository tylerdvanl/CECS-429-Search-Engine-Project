Wear appropriate footwear and make sure your tires are in good condition and your vehicle is appropriate for the road surface. Weather: Many sites along the trail are in remote locations, or you may find yourself out in the elements enjoying a new location. Weather can change rapidly. Bring appropriate clothing layers, sunscreen, a hat, and any other items to protect you from the elements. Check the weather before you go.Remote areas: Many trail sites occur in very remote areas, far from gas, restrooms, cell service, food, or lodging.
