The plan is the culmination of a four year process that has involved local citizens, American Indian tribes, and public and private agencies.  The plan guides the management of resources, visitor use, and general development at the park. The primary purpose of the plan is to provide a foundation from which to protect park resources while providing for meaningful visitor experiences. A secondary purpose is to encourage compatible activities on adjacent lands so as to minimize adverse effects on the park.  The environmental impacts of implementing the management plan were analysed in a Draft General Management Plan and Environmental Impacts Assessment. The direction for future park management is based on the laws establishing the park and the National Park Service, the purpose of the park and its significant resources.  The park developed a Foundation Statement [760kb pdf] in 2010; this document records our shared understanding of the park's purpose, significance, and resources and values. Additionally, it serves as a foundation for future planning and management.        To learn more, see the Administrative History of Grand Canyon National Park, a political and economic history of the park's first hundred years .
