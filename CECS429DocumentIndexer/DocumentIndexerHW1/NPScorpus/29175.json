    "body": "2005 Songwriter Festival         Festival CD cover Western National Parks Association  Recognizing that music has been and continues to be an integral part of the visitor experience at park, a songwriter festival and contest was staged at Bromide Pavilion in October 2005. Songwriters from three states wrote and performed original works that interpreted the natural and historic resources of the park and captured the essence of very personal and profound experiences unique to the setting. Many musicians returned in June of 2006 to perform their original works again at the park's Centennial Celebration. A CD was produced from the live performance and a lyric booklet was written to accompany it. The CD is now a sales item at Travertine Nature Center and captures the spirit of the festival.      2005 Songwriter Festival — Celebrating 100 Years of Park History  Ghosts of the Chickasaw — Brenda Darnell; Lone Grove, Oklahoma The Chickasaw Calls Me Home — Sylvia Urech and Lewis Case; Dallas, Texas Kay-Yah Chickasaw — Dawn Anita Plumlee; Duncan, Oklahoma Waters of the Chickasaw — David Johnson; Walter, Oklahoma Family Reunion — Alan Fazier; Sulphur, Oklahoma Healin' Waters — Denny Spradling; Ardmore, Oklahoma Memories of a Chickasaw National Park — Jean Crawford; Broken Bow, Oklahoma A Mother's Night Song — Preston Edgar; Sulphur, Oklahoma Chickasaw National Park — Steve Wooten; Dibble, Oklahoma CNRA I Think I'll Stay — Kent Dakour; Ardmore, Oklahoma Chickasaw Wind — Gerald Kahlen; Durant, Oklahoma Take Me Back — Debbie Henning; Bethany, Oklahoma Arbuckle Mountains Where I Was Born — Gary Fullerton; Davis, Oklahoma Heart and Soul — Lauren Lee and Sawyer Lee; Holdenville, Oklahoma Haven — Clark Townsend; Bethany, Oklahoma",
