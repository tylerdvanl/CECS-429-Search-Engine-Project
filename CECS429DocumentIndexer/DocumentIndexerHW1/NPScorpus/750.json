The great temple of Kamehameha the Great, Pu'ukohola Heiau, rises majestically above the turquoise waters of the Pacific, a silent testament to the most renowned king of Hawai'i. Mailekini Heiau, the temple-turned-fort that once thundered with the sound of cannons, continues to stand guard. The sharks return most days to Hale o Kapuni Heiau, the sumberged ruins of a temple that was once dedicated to them. This is where the history-makers of Hawai'i lived and where their history comes to life. Come to Pu'ukohola Heiau National Historic Site and step into history.",
