Visitors may access the area at any time but overnight camping is not permitted. The Aleutian World War II National Historic area can be accessed in the summer via an unimproved gravel switchback road from the city of Unalaska. In the winter you will need snowshoes or skis.   Dress for the weather during all seasons by making sure you have warm, water proof clothing!   If you plan to travel in privately owned areas, like the National Historic Area on Mount Ballyhoo, you will need to obtain a land permit from the Ounalashka Corporation. Also, our walking \/ driving guides provide useful information regarding privately and publicly owned areas of the park.   The visitor center operating hours vary in summer and winter. The center is always open when the ferry is in port. Special openings may be scheduled through the Ounalashka Corporation at (907) 581-1276.",
