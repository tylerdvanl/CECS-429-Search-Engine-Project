In 1995, a Water Quality Baseline Inventory was initiated and data was collected for 3 years.  Using this information, several sites were selected for a long term monitoring program, which is still ongoing at the present time.  All water quality data is stored in our data base for use by scientisits and researchers. Through a cooperative agreement with the National Weather Service, Fort Clatsop National Memorial set up a weather station in 1998 and began recording daily weather conditions.  Monthly reports are compiled and sent in to the Portland office.  The park's climate is mild and wet with annual precipitation averging about 70 inches per year.  Average annual temperatures range from a high of 67 degrees (F) to a low of 35 degrees (F).
