    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Permits & Reservations              Permits and Reservations       Special Events and Permits   Some activities are allowed within the Monument but, by law, require a special use permit. This can include commercial photography (film or still), guided tours and other business operations, scientific research, running and bicycle races on Highway 92, weddings, and large group picnics or other gatherings in the Swinging Bridge picnic area.   Every situation is different, and doesn't need to be complicated or time consuming, but the permit process makes sure that park resources are protected and that the event doesn't unreasonably interfere with the enjoyment of the park by other visitors. See the links below for the most common permitting situations we encounter. If you have questions or if you are unsure if your event\/ activity requires a permit, call the administration offices at (801) 756-5238.
