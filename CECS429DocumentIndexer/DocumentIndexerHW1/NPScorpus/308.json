NPS   The Special Use Permit  The permit system is intended to help assure, to the extent possible, that the activities that may be taking place on any given day will not conflict with each other or with general visitor activities. Please note that all applications, unless determined to be a First Amendment activity, must be accompanied by a payment for initial processing. The application processing cost for special use applications is $50. These activities require some degree of management from the National Park Service if there is the potential for interference with visitor use, congestion of a highly visited area, or possible impact on park resources.  Payment of application cost may be in the form of check, money order or credit card.         The Monument Marathon helps fund the Western Nebraska Community College Foundation, which grants approximately $350,000.00 annually in scholarships to WNCC students.
