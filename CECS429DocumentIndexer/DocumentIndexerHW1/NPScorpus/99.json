Stevens resort.   Today, stand on a rocky shore in Voyageurs National Park:  like people of the early cultures, you will hear the water lapping on rocks and wind in the pines. like the fur traders, you will see signs of beaver and other wild creatures. like the early pioneers of industry, you will see rocks veined with gold, forests of pine and aspen, and miles of waterways. like the first recreation seekers, you will see a place of beauty little changed.",
