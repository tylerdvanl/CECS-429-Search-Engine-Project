Big Bend's improved dirt roads are accessible for most vehicles, but some are rougher than others and road conditions deteriorate quickly with a passing storm. Please inquire about current conditions before venturing out along one of these roads.        Mariscal Mine NPS Photo\/Cookie Ballou  Primitive Dirt Roads Miles of primitive dirt roads lead across washboards and boulders, through canyons and creek beds, past old settlements and cemeteries. In addition to marvelous panoramic vistas, many of these roads access hiking trails, primitive roadside campsites, and the river. Primitive dirt roads are maintained for high-clearance vehicles only, and may require a 4WD. They may be rocky with areas of soft sand that are unsafe for sedans or RVs. Rain can make roads difficult to drive or impassable. Always inquire about current road conditions.",
