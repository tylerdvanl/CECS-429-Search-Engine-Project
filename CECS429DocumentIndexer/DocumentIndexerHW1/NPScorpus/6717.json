NPS photo  Wetlands are described as areas of organic soil, with poor drainage, and emergent aquatic vegetation.  Wetlands within the park are mainly located along the floodplains of the two rivers, however, an extensive wetland created by beavers is located along Flowing Springs.  According to National Wetland Inventory Maps produced by the USGS, the park contains over 100 acres of wetlands.  The most prominent wetland is the 7-acre wetland adjacent to Shoreline Drive.   In this wetland, a few inches of water lie above the substrate, with greater duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza) frequently covering the surface. This type of habitat supports many species of both terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates, small mammals, waterfowl and marsh birds, reptiles, and amphibians. Great blue herons (Ardea herodias), northern water snakes (Nerodia sipedon), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), and snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) are just a few of the wildlife species that may be encountered while exploring this wetland area.",
