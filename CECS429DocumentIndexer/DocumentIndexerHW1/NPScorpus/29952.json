    "body": "Advanced Junior Ranger Program          The 24-page Junior Ranger activity booklet Learning All About Fire Island National Seashoreâ€”Advanced requires additional reading and research. Some work is designed to be completed on-site, while answers to many of the exercises will take more effort. Booklets are available at each of the park's visitor contact stations: Wilderness, Watch Hill, Sailors Haven, and at the Fire Island Lighthouse, the Patchogue Ferry Terminal and the William Floyd Estate. The Fire Island Lighthouse and the Wilderness Visitor Center are open year-round. Other sites are open seasonally. Upon completion of this booklet, an Advanced Junior Ranger bar will be awarded.",
