    "body": "Pinnacle Peak Trail      Pinnacle Peak Trail    Tatoosh Mountain Range  Â    Pinnacle Peak Trail   Distance, round trip: 2.5 miles Elevation gain: 1050 feet Hiking time, round trip: 2 hours Wilderness Camps: None  Trail Description Pinnacle Peak is situated in the middle of the Tatoosh Range at an elevation of 6,562 feet, the second highest peak in the range.   Drive east either from Longmire or Paradise on the Stevens Canyon Road to the parking area at Reflection Lakes. The trailhead is on the south side of the road.   The trail begins with a gradual ascent but soon becomes a steep climb to the 5,920-foot saddle where the trail ends. Hiking boots are recommended since this trail has either a snow or loose rock surface all summer. NOTE: Always check current trail conditions before heading out. Log footbridges frequently wash out during the winter or other conditions could be affecting the trail.  Along the Trail On a clear day the spectacular view from the saddle makes this hike well worth the effort. To the north is a dramatic close up view of Mount Rainier and Paradise. To the south, one sees Mount Adams and Mount St. Helens in the foreground and Oregon's Mount Hood on the horizon. This is an excellent trail on which to see pikas and marmots. Backpacking There is no designated camp along this trail nor atop the Tatoosh Range. Permits are required for camping. Permits and current trail conditions are available at park-wide from wilderness information centers, ranger stations, and visitor centers. Treat water before drinking. Fires are prohibited. No pets on trails.",
