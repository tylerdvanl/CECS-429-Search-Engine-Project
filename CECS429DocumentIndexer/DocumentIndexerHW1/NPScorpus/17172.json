    "body": "Reptiles         A turtle basks in the sun in spring when they breed. ian Lothian  The park is home to three species of snakes (not poisonous), three indigenous turtles two nonindigenous turtles, and two skinks. These animals help control the mice that carry deer ticks, and eat grubs that destroy plant roots. They are shy, and will not harass visitors. Reptiles, like amphibians, are facing increased reproductive problems from human drugs in their environment. Reptiles have a longer life span,and do not reach sexual maturity in some species until they are eight or more years old. As eggs are often eaten before they hatch, reptiles face serious survival threats. This park preserves habitat critical to their survival. Please walk with courtesy to our resident reptiles.",
