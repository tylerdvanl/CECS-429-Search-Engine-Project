    "body": "International Volunteers       Rocky Mountain National Park is part of the United States Government. We welcome volunteers from any country in the world (non-citizens cannot be hired into paid Federal positions). Most positions are available during our summer season. Some volunteer positions are provided government housing at no cost to the volunteer. Due to housing constraints, opportunities for international volunteering are extremely limited at Rocky Mountain National Park. Our international volunteers may work in wildlife biology, ecology, botany, integrated pest management, interpretation, etc. Please read the information at: www.nps.gov\/oia\/topics\/ivip\/ivip.htm should you wish to volunteer with the National Park Service. You must find a supervisor to host you and it is a long process to receive a J-1 (training) visa from our International Affairs Office in Washington, DC. If you are interested in being a volunteer, you may download a PDF format volunteer application by clicking on the link below: Volunteer ApplicationPlease complete the application and e-mail it or send it to the following address: Rocky Mountain National Park Volunteer Office 1000 U.S. Hwy 36 Estes Park, CO 80517",
