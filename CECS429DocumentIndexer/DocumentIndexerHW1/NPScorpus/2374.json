Download the Grand Canyon National Park North Rim Development Plan (3.62MB PDF File) The Development Plan was initiated by Grand Canyon National Park management for the purpose of further refining the 1995 General Management Plan (GMP) direction for development on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park. The primary study area included five development nodes on the Bright Angel Peninsula: CC Hill, North Rim National Park Service Headquarters, campground, concessioner housing, and visitor lodging areas. The boundary of the study area also extended to include Lindbergh Hill, North Rim entrance station, and Arizona State Highway 67 road corridor, which traverses through the Kaibab National Forest between the north boundary of the park and Jacob Lake, Arizona. While some portions of the GMP actions for the North Rim have been implemented, and many projects are currently underway that are consistent with the vision outlined in the GMP, other significant GMP direction related to transit, visitor orientation\/interpretation and structure utilization remains to be initiated. The park began this North Rim development planning effort to provide a framework for focused analysis of these development needs and to assess environmental impacts before undertaking substantial program changes for the North Rim.",
