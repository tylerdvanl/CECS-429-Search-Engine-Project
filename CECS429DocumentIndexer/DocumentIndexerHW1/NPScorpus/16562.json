Many authorized companies offer snowmobile and snowcoach tours and shuttles. Individuals can also enter the lottery for our non-commercially guided snowmobile program. The lottery opens in September: remaining dates or cancellations become available in November on a first-come, first-served basis. *The road between Mammoth Hot Springs and the northeast entrance is open to regular traffic all year.",
