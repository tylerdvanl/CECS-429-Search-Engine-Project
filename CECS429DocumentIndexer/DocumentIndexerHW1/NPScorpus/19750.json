The river is home for trout, bass, catfish and 20 other species of fish. The Chattahoochee River is the southernmost trout river in the United States. This is possible due to Buford Dam releasing cold water from the bottom of Lake Lanier and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources stocking the river. Housing over two hundred and forty bird species, there's not a corner you turn without hearing the sweets sounds of nature. You are likely to see the graceful blue heron soaring above the river, with it's neck bent for flight in the shape of an 's' and its wings outstretched five to six feet. Some species make their home in the river corridor and others are just passing through while traveling the eastern flyway. The forest along the river is home to many species including rabbits and white tailed deer. If you walk quietly in the late summer, you might see fawn just starting to forage alone. At this young age, they are especially beautiful with their large white spots and long, lanky legs, silently leaping up banks or over fallen trees. At dusk, it is shift change for the animals in the park. A symphony begins with the call of the owls and the frogs. The bats dart about, honing in on their dinner of insects, while the toads leap underfoot and the crickets join in.",
