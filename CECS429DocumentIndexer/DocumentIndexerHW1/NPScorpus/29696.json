    "body": "Site Guide Book       The Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural Site Foundation is very pleased to offer to the public its site guide book. Twenty-four pages long, the booklet is filled with wonderful photographs, informative text, and engaging quotations. Black-and-white images from the turn of the last century are used alongside vivid color images depicting the restored home of Ansley Wilcox. Readers have a chance to learn more about the Pan-American Exposition, William McKinley’s fateful 1901 trip to Western New York, as well as Theodore Roosevelt’s solemn inauguration in the library of Ansley Wilcox’s stately Delaware Avenue residence. A brief biography of the man who began his presidency in Buffalo is included, as is a short synopsis concerning the life and career of Ansley Wilcox. Additionally, the long and varied history of the building and property is explored: from its early days as part of the Buffalo Barracks during the 1830s and 1840s, through its more than eighty years as a private home; its subsequent transformation into a fashionable restaurant, as well as the long struggle to preserve the structure as a National Historic Site. Finally, a list of \"Other Theodore Roosevelt Related Sites and Resources\" is included at the back of the guidebook. The new booklet makes a great souvenir and is a must-have for anyone interested in Theodore Roosevelt and\/or the site of his unusual inauguration. It is currently for sale in the gift shop for $5.95, plus tax. Phone orders are also being accepted at 716-884-0095. (Please note that phone or mail orders are subject to a shipping and handling fee.)",
