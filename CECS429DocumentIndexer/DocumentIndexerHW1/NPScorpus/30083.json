    "body": "Oversand Vehicle Operation       Oversand Vehicle Operation  Motorized off-road vehicle (ORV) use is only designated in limited National Park Service areas. Where permitted, ORVs may be allowed only in locations where there will be no adverse impacts on the area's natural, cultural, scenic, and esthetic values, and in consideration of other existing or proposed recreational uses.  The National Park Service recognizes that motorized equipment operated in a national park \"could adversely affect the park's natural soundscape and the flow of natural chemical information and odors that are important to many living organisms.\" (2006 National Park Service Management Policies, 8.2.3) The rhythmic sound of the breaking waves, the smell of the salt air, the sight of relatively unspoiled sandy beaches-these are some of the values for which Fire Island National Seashore was established.  Because there are 17 residential communities within the boundaries of the Fire Island National Seashore, limited driving is permitted by contractors, utilities and a small number of residents to support the maintenance of these communities. Such permits are tightly restricted and regulated. (See Off-Road Driving Regulations.) Recreational ORV driving is permitted by the Seashore seasonally from the Wilderness Visitor Center to Long Cove, with a current valid Fire Island National Seashore Sportsman's Vehicle Permit. Oversand Vehicle Operation Restrictions:  As ferry service increases throughout the spring, the National Park Service gradually restricts driving for various permit categories. Please refer to the links below to determine when driving is allowed and how to obtain an exception if you are a permit holder.  Restrictions for Resident Permit Holders Restrictions for Contractors and Essential Service Permit Holders      Permit Fees As directed by Congress, the National Park Service collects a fee to recover the cost of administering permits. Recoverable fees are charged for permits as described in 16 U.S.C. 3a, 31 U.S.C. 9701, and National Park Service Guidelines for Special Park Uses.
