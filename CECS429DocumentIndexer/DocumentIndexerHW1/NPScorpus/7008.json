An abundance of native grasses provide sustenance for grazing animals both large and small while the tapestry of different habitats attracts a great number of birds. The terrain of the badlands creates microclimates of warm, dry slopes, relatively cool and wet juniper woodlands, and riverbottoms. Amphibians - Very few amphibians eke out an existence in the harsh North Dakota climate. Birds - More than 186 types of birds may be found living in or passing through Theodore Roosevelt National Park. Mammals - Large grazing animals including bison, feral horses, elk, white-tail and mule deer, pronghorn, and small grazers such as prairie dogs share the range in the park. Reptiles - Several varieties of snakes and lizards dwell in the semi-arid climate of western North Dakota. Wildlife Management - The park works to keep the population of certain species balanced to maintain a healthy ecosystem. You can learn more about the habitats that these animals use on the Natural Features & Ecosystems page.
