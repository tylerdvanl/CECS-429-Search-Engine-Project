Backcountry camping allows you to immerse yourself in the beauty and challenge of the Preserve's wild side. By carrying everything you need to survive on your back, or in your off-road vehicle you can discover a world beyond where the pavement ends.      A Backcountry Camping Permit is required for all backcountry camping. Permits are free and can be filled out on-line and printed. Additionally, they are located at every backcountry trailhead and you can get them at both visitor centers. The permits take only a few minutes to complete.
