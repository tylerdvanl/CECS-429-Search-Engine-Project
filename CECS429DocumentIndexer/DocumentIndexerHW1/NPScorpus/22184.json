Such closures or restrictions may be short or long term. Except in emergencies, significant closures will be published as rulemaking in the Federal Register. Closures or restrictions listed here may not be all inclusive. Visitors should be aware of posted closure signs, fences or other barricades, notices on park bulletin boards, as well as notices in local newspapers.
