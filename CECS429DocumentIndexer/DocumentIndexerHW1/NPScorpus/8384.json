    "body": "Group Volunteer Projects       Volunteer groups carry out a wide variety of projects. From conducting a beach clean-up or trimming vegetation along boardwalks and nature trails to adding to our knowledge of the park through citizen science, volunteer groups provide the many hands needed to greatly enhance park facilities and habitats.  Schedule Your Work Day Call the Volunteer Coordinator at 252-728-2250 ext. 3008 to learn more about these and other opportunities and to plan your work day! Attention Scouts! Complete at least 10 hours of volunteer service (or a combination of volunteering and taking part in educational programs such as the Junior Ranger Adventures or attending a ranger program) and you can earn a Resource Stewardship Scout Ranger patch. More information can be found on the Scout Rangers webpage.",
