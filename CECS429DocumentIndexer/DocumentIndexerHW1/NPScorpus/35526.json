The birds found along the riparian areas of the American Fork River often extend their habitats from streamside to high up the canyon walls foraging in the foliage and on the ground.  Take a walk along the Swinging Bridge nature trail and look for American Dippers feeding along the river.  While hiking the cave trail you are likely to encounter a variety of birds that inhabit both riparian and montane habitats such as the Steller’s Jay, Broad-Tailed and Black-Chinned Hummingbirds, Orange-Crowned and Virginia’s Warblers, Black-Headed Grosbeaks, Chipping Sparrows, and Dark-Eyed Juncos.  During the spring and summer keep an eye out for the Western Tanager whose brilliant red, yellow, and black breeding plumage is a delight to even the most seasoned enthusiast.  As you enjoy the scenery of the canyon from the cave entrance you may see Golden Eagles, Red-Tailed Hawks, Peregrine Falcons, Violet Green Swallows, and Townsend’s Solitaires.  You are sure to hear the descending trill of the Canyon Wren who often nests at the entrance to Hansen Cave.",
