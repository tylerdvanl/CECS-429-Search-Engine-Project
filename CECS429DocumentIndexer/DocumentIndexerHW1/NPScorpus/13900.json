    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Basic Information     Pets              Pets          At all times, pets must be restrained on a leash no longer than six feet in length. Leashes protect dogs from becoming lost and from other hazard such as running into busy streets. Leashes also help protect park resources, including wildlife and vegetation, as well as other park visitors. Pets should never be left unattended. Summer sunshine poses a threat to pets left inside vehicles. On a bright, sunny day, even in temperatures as low as 60°F, temperatures inside a vehicle can reach dangerous levels. On an 85°F day, the temperature inside a car-even with the windows cracked-can reach over 100°F within 10 minutes. Pet owners are responsible for removing pet waste.",
