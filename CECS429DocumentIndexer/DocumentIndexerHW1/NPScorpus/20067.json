Stafford Beach campground, all trails, and roadways are open for regular use. Check back for photos and video of prescribed burn operations.  The Beach Field burn near Dungeness has been cancelled due to weather conditions. The date of the operation will be determined by the appropriate weather and atmospheric conditions.  In accordance with the park's Fire Management Plan, park staff will look to introduce fire to specific locations in the Stafford and Dungeness areas. This will be a multi-agency effort with wildland fire crews coming from across the country to support the operation. Maps of the scheduled burn areas are available below. Smoke impacts are likely near the burn areas. People with respiratory conditions should be cautious. Cumberland Island National Seashore staff and its partners are working together to provide for a safe and successful operation. Prescribed burns are subject to atmospheric and weather conditions. Particulars are subject to change. Thank you for your patience.           Stafford Field Fire Project Map            Stafford Plantation Fire Project Map            Beach Field Fire Project Map        A wildfire burns through a stand of longleaf pines on Cumberland Island. National Park Service  Why Fire Management The National Park Service manages wildland fire to protect the public, communities and infrastructure, conserve natural and cultural resources, and restore and maintain ecological health. Cumberland Island exhibits abundant vegetation and wildlife habitat, although much of the island's vegetation was altered by human activities before the National Seashore was established in 1972. In addition, vegetation and habitat have been altered through the general practice of suppressing all wildland fires, which has continued during NPS management on the island. Longleaf pines are just one important ecosystem found on Cumberland Island. Longleaf pines and associated organisms evolved to not only withstand fire, but to be dependent on it for their survival. In order for longleaf pine seeds to germinate and grow, they must fall on open bare mineral soil, typically cleared by fire. In the absence of fire, pine needles and other forest debris will build up as ground litter and keep longleaf seeds from sprouting. Also, shade from a thick understory can kill longleaf seedlings. If this happens, as the mature longleaf pines die -- at an age of several hundred years -- they are replaced by broadleaved trees, such as oaks or hickories, and the whole ecosystem changes. This is the well-known ecological principle of succession. Many plants and animals depend on the longleaf pine for their survival, thus making the longleaf pine habitat one of the most diverse habitats found in North America. For example, the gopher tortoises are important, for as many as 300 other animals use their 15-20 foot deep burrows. These include snakes, frogs, foxes, spiders, and beetles.      Read more about fire management at Cumberland Island National Seashore in the Fire Management Plan.",
