Park management is committed to ensuring compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations, requirements, policies, and Executive Orders addressing the protection of the environment. Park managers will incorporate pollution prevention, waste reduction, best environmental management practices and environmentally preferable purchasing in all park management activities and will strive for continual improvement in each of these areas. Park managers recognize that this mission is a moving target. It is a mission which will never be “done,” but will require continual effort and commitment of energy and resources. We pledge ourselves to this challenge.          Glacier Bay Climate Change Brochure   Climate Change in Glacier Bay Download the entire Brochure PDF 3 mb        NPS Climate Change Website   National Park Service Climate Change Website Learn about climate change and how it is already affecting national parks.
