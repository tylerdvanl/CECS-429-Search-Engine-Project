    "body": "CESI Monitoring Projects by Title          These projects allow land managers to evaluate the status of particular species and ecosystems and assess improvements over time. The status and trends information gained from monitoring is applied toward the development and analysis of restoration objectives. Projects below can be sorted according to year, project title or principal investigator. Where available, click on project titles for more in-depth project information.
