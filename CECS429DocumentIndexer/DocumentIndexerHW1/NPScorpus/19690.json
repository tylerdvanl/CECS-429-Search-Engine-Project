During the 14 months it operated, more than 45,000 Union soldiers were confined here. The park has three main features, the National Prisoner of War Museum, the historic prison site, and the Andersonville National Cemetery. A visit to the park provides an opportunity to explore the sacrifices made by American prisoners of war throughout our history. Most visitors spend at least two hours in the park. Those with a special interest in the Civil War or American prisoners of war could easily spend most of the day at Andersonville National Historic Site. The park grounds are open daily from 8:00 am until 5:00 p.m. EST, allowing access to the National Prisoner of War Museum, the historic prison site and the Andersonville National Cemetery. The park grounds including the National Prisoner of War Museum and the historic prison site are closed only three days per year: New Years Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.",
