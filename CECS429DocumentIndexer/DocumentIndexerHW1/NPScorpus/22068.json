Both are gravel roads that are owned and maintained by the state of Alaska and not the National Park Service. Both roads are usually passable to all vehicles during the summer months. For driving beyond Mile 29 of the Nabesna Road, a high clearance vehicle is recommended. Conditions can change quickly, so it's a good idea to stop by the Copper Center or Chitina visitor centers to check on current road conditions. You can also check with the Alaska Road Traveler Information Service for the latest conditions. Driving a Rental? Most major car rental companies in Anchorage do not let renters drive vehicles on gravel roads (but you should still ask). Several of the discount and independent rental companies do, but may have added expenses or requirements for such a rental. You may want to contact the following companies about renting a vehicle that you can drive on a gravel road. This list may not be complete. Please do a full internet search for more possibilities.

Although traffic and weather often result in potholes and washboarded surfaces, under normal summer conditions most passenger vehicles can make the trip. Please check on current conditions before heading out. You can inquire about road conditions at the Chitina Ranger Station. Although regularly maintained by the State of Alaska, the gravel surface makes for slow travel. It will take about 3 hours each way to drive this road. Other hazards can make it even longer: there are curves with limited visibility, heavy rain can cause ruts and potholes, sharp rocks can cause flat tires, and narrow, one-lane bridges make maneuvering large vehicles difficult. In fact, large vehicles are not encouraged to drive this road. Under normal summer conditions, most two-wheel drive vehicles can make the trip without difficulty, but be sure to carry at least one spare tire and an adequate jack. If you don't want to take your own vehicle on the road, you can take a shuttle or fly there. There is NO GAS along the McCarthy Road. At this time, the last place to obtain fuel is in Kenny Lake, AK. Are you curious about what you'll be seeing as you drive? Follow the McCarthy Road Guide as you drive along the McCarthy Road. At the end of the road, you will find parking areas and two foot bridges that cross the Kennicott River and lead to McCarthy and Kennecott. Access to McCarthy is by foot, bike, or shuttle. From McCarthy, it's a five mile hike to the Kennecott historic mine area. For those who would rather not walk, there are shuttle rides available during the summer months.The McCarthy road provides access to interesting geology, great hiking, fishing, and camping, as well as the wonderful historic communities of McCarthy and Kennecott. Once you get to Kennecott, stop by the Kennecott Visitor Center for park information.           The Nabesna Road: The Road Less Traveled The 42-mile Nabesna Road was originally built in 1933 by the Alaska Road Commission to supply Nabesna Mine and to ship out its ore. Today, the Alaska Department of Transportation maintains the Nabesna Road and, generally, the road is passable by most two-wheel drive vehicles. However, higher clearance and\/or four-wheel drive are occasionally needed beyond Mile 29 due to stream crossings. Wet conditions such as spring run-off and heavy rain can make these stream crossings impassable. The last four miles of the road are not maintained and may be deeply rutted and wet. Vehicle travel on this portion of the road is not recommended. Are you curious about what you'll be seeing as you drive? Follow the Nabesna Road Guide as you drive along the Nabesna Road. You can also download the Nabesna Road Audio Tour. Please stop at the Slana Ranger Station for park information. Backcountry access by off-road vehicles (ORVs) on established trails is allowed with a permit obtained from the Slana Ranger Station. No gas or vehicle repair service is available in the area. Please respect private property located in many places along the road.",
