Designed by landscape architect William Saunders and dedicated on November 19, 1863 by President Abraham Lincoln, the cemetery is located on Cemetery Hill south of Gettysburg. Not only is this burial ground significant as one of the first national cemeteries and as the site of the Gettysburg Address, it is situated in the anchor of the Union battle line of July 1-3, 1863.
