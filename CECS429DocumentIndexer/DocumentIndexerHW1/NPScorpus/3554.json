If you are camping within one quarter-mile of Lake Powell's shoreline, or more than 200 yards from a designated restroom facility, you are required to possess and utilize a human sanitation device (portable toilet) that does not use plastic bags to contain the waste. This waste may not be disposed of in the trash, but only at pumpout\/dump stations located on the lake and at the marinas. As an alternative, you may use a commercial Waste Bag Containment System, that can be disposed of in the trash. Portable toilets and Waste Bag Systems are available at camping and fishing supply stores. It doesn't work if you don't use it. Some people may think that digging a hole in the sand behind a bush is good enough. However, the lake level fluctuates a great deal throughout the year, and the cat hole you dug months ago could be covered with water today, resulting in your human waste floating in the lake. So in order to keep Lake Powell Pure, having a portable toilet with you is not enough. It must be used. Before your trip to Lake Powell, learn the mechanics of your portable toilet and make sure everyone in your group uses it. Don't dump your tank in the lake. It is illegal to use a boat on Lake Powell that can discharge sewage overboard. If your boat has a Marine Sanitation Device capable of overboard sewage discharge, it must be completely disconnected from the discharge port, the holding tank must only be connected to a deck mounted pumpout fitting, and sewage holding tanks have all discharge outlets capped or plugged.       Map showing floating restooms\/dump stations on Lake Powell.        Compliance is easy. With eight floating restrooms\/dump stations, and six areas within Lake Powell's marinas, you are never too far from a place to empty your portable toilet. If you and everyone else uses their portable toilet properly, you will never have to worry about a smelly camp, tripping over something nasty in the middle of the night, or swimming in contaminated waters. Let us help. Each week during the summer, National Park Service scientists use a state-of-the-art water laboratory to test for Esherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria from water collected at many beaches on Lake Powell. E. coli has been shown in numerous studies to be the best indicator of fecal pollution in water and can directly relate to the risk of human illness from recreation contact. In 2004, there were no E. coli counts high enough to close any of Lake Powell's beaches. It is through this cooperation of everyone who visits the lake that we can all celebrate this success, and continue to keep Lake Powell Pure.  If high counts of E. coli bacteria are found, beaches will be marked by bright yellow buoys and signs as closed until the levels return to normal.  Report illegal dumping by calling 928-608-6200",
