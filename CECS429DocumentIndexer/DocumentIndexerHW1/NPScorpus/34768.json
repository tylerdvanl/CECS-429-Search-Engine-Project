Native Americans passed through the park in search of chert, a type of rock used for making arrowheads and other stone tools, and hunted in the forests and meadows. Early Mormon settlers herded cattle and sheep through the grassy highlands. Later, Civilian Conservation Corps crews worked on land improvement projects, including building Cedar Breaks' Visitor Center and Ranger Caretaker Cabin. Finally, the National Park Service's long presence has become a part of Cedar Breaks' culture.",
