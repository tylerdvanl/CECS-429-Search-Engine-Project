Â    Completed Planning Documents 2010 Mountain Pine Beetle Action Plan A National Park Service Rapid Resource Assessment Team (RRAT) created an action plan to address the Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB) epidemic that is causing ponderosa pine mortality throughout the Black Hills. Working with area agencies, the memorial developed this plan to slow and hopefully mitigate the movement of the pine beetle into the memorial. Press Release (.pdf) Mountain Pine Beetle Plan (7.58mb .pdf)  Backcountry Trail Environmental Assessment  Mount Rushmore National Memorial completed an Environmental Assessment in 2009 on a proposed backcountry trail for the park. The approximately 9.8 miles of trail in the proposed system would be constructed in phases along with accompanying visitor comfort stations, information kiosks, and trailheads. The multi-loop trail will encompass the memorial and will provide several shorter sub-loops to allow shorter hikes on the trail and hikes of varying length and difficulty.
