Volunteer! There are many ways to get involved at President's Park during the holiday season. From set up before the ceremony to visitor services during the event, volunteer staff play a crucial role in the success of the National Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony. We also need volunteers to brave the cold weather and who wish to spread a bit of good cheer at the National Christmas Tree during the Pathway of Peace. We hope to see you in December!                   2015 National Christmas Tree   10 Photos  Photos of the 2015 National Christmas Tree          2010 National Christmas Tree    2 Photos  Photos of the 2010 National Christmas Tree          2008 National Christmas Tree   31 Photos  Photos of the 2008 National Christmas Tree            2007 National Christmas Tree   27 Photos  Photos of the 2007 National Christmas Tree                        Since 1923, the National Christmas Tree has been a traditional celebration of the holiday season.
