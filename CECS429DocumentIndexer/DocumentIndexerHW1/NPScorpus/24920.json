Their color varies greatly throughout the year, but they are always the most colorful during mating season. The bodies of males become orange, red, and black, with bright orange to red spots. Their fins change to red and black with a white edge. Females are no less impressive, but have a darker tone. People in northwest Alaska often fish for Dolly Varden, one of many fish species relied on for food.",
