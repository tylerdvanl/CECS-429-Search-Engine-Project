Volunteers are important to Frederica.  They help run the visitor center.  They share the history of the park; give tours and \"living history\" presentations.  Volunteers work in the period garden.  They also help care for our artifacts.  Because of the energy, enthusiasm, and commitment of our volunteers, Fort Frederica is able to offer visitors a high quality experience of history.  As a volunteer, you will open the door to the past, and let the visitor step into another time.  You are invited to be a part of this fun and rewarding experience.  Fort Frederica wants volunteers who are committed to our mission: \"to preserve and protect the historic, cultural, and natural objects on our site, for the benefit and enjoyment of the public, now and in the future\".  Our volunteers have many different skills, but they have one thing in common; whatever they do, the mission of Fort Frederica National Monument is foremost in their minds.  They are here because they recognize its importance and want to make it a reality.       Current Volunteer Opportunities",
