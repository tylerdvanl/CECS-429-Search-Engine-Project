The former mess halls in the basement were converted into two large jail cells, nicknamed \"Hell on the Border.\"         Click here to view a 96 page report (PDF) on the Fort Smith courtroom which includes historical information on the court and its original furnishings.       Also check out:  Stories from the Federal Court Era People of the Federal Court Era",
