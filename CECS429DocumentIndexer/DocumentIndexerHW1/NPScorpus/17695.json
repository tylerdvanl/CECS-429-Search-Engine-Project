The finding aid may include descriptive information; repository information; collection history; biographical or historical information on creators of the collection; and in some cases a container or folder list of everything in the collection. The collection is housed at the Park Archives and Records Center and all collections are available for research upon request during open hours or by appointment. Please visit the Collections page for more information, email us, or call (415) 561-2807.  Each link below will lead to a selection of finding aids that are relevant to the geographic areas of the GGNRA or other topics of interest. These finding aids are only a handful of the over two thousand collections housed at the Park Archives and Records Center.
