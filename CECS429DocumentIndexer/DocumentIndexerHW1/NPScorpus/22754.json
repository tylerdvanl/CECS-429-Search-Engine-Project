The National Park Service Checklist of Birds of Denali provides a general overview of the relative seasonal abundance, migration status, and general habitat of the 166 species of birds thus far recorded at Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska. National Park Service scientists maintain a contemporary checklist to reflect results of ongoing bird studies in all portions of Denali.  The National Park Service Checklist of Birds in Denali was derived from the checklist of Denali's birds developed by Ken Kertell and Doug Murphy in 1985, and updated and revised by Alan Seegert and Carol McIntyre in 2006. This checklist of Denali's birds by Kertell, Murphy and Seegert is available for purchase through at Alaska Geographic bookstores in the park.   The abundance and distribution of many of the birds found in Denali often cycle with seasonal food resources. Therefore, this checklist may not accurately reflect abundance in all years. Northern hawk owls, short-eared owls, white-winged crossbills, and common redpolls may be common or abundant in one year and then nearly absent in others. Golden eagles usually migrate out of the area in fall, but some individuals may overwinter when food resources (snowshoe hare) are abundant.  Phylogenetic sequence and English and scientific names follow The A.O.U. Checklist of North America Birds (Seventh ed., 1998, and through the 52nd supplement 2011).  We gather new data on Denali's birds every year. Please report any new sightings to Denali National Park and Preserve personnel.",
