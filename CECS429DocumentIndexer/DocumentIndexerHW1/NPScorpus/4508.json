Dry Tortugas National Park is situated at the southwest corner of the Florida Keys reef system, the third largest in the world. Due to the remote location, and easterly flowing gulf current just south of the park, you are sure to discover a much greater abundance of marine life and often much larger versions than anywhere else in the Florida Keys.             Garden Key The swim areas on Garden Key are only accessible via North and South Beach. These beaches offer gradual slope and easy entry and are ideal for beginner swimmers and snorkelers.             Loggerhead Key This designated swimming area is located of the Northwest side of Loggerhead Key. This area is protected, shallow and calm, a great place for swimming and snorkeling. Within the swim area, a few yards off the swim beach is a remarkable coral formation aptly named Little Africa. The coral formation resembles the continent of Africa when looking down on the reef from above.         Swimming Safety   No lifeguard on duty. Swim at your own risk.   Make sure to stay within your abilities.   Watch children closely.   Don’t swim alone.   Beware of strong current.   Do not touch or stand on coral or stand on seagrass.  Do not enter moat or dive from walls.",
