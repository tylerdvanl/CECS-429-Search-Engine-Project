    "body": "Butterflies       When wildflowers bloom on the South Dakota prairie, watch for these bright jewels fluttering about!  Of the estimated 14,500 butterfly species in the world, 177 live in South Dakota and 69 have been documented in Badlands.   Butterfly distribution depends upon the presence of appropriate host plants, which in turn vary according to local soil, moisture, temperature, and elevation.  The mixed-grass prairie of Badlands is dominated by grasses like wheatgrass, buffalograss, and blue grama, but associated forbs serve as host plants for butterfly larvae and provide food for adults.  The familiar orange-and-black monarch butterfly feeds on milkweed, tolerating toxins produced in the plant that render the butterfly unpalatable to birds.   Another large, distinctive butterfly seen in Badlands is the two-tailed swallowtail.  Reaching five inches in wingspan, this bright yellow-and-black insect favors chokecherry, green ash, and wild plum as a host plant.  Mourning cloaks, purplish-brown with wings edged in creamy yellow, prefer willows and cottonwoods.    Many other species, including sulphurs, whites, coppers, hairstreaks, blues, frittilaries, and skippers, may also be observed.  Please remember to enjoy butterflies at a distance—it is illegal to net or collect them in the national park.  Cameras and binoculars can be very useful tools for enjoying these living gems.            Badlands Butterfly List     Anise Swallowtail   Spring Azure   Goatweed Butterfly     Eastern Tiger Swallowtail   Silvery Blue   Hackberry Emperor     Two-tailed Swallowtail   Melissa Blue   Little Wood-Satyr     Checkered White   Lupine Blue   Prairie Ringlet     Western White   Variegated Fritillary   Common Wood-Nymph     Cabbage White   Great Spangled Fritillary   Monarch     Olympia Marble   Manitoba Fritillary   Silver-spotted Skipper     Clouded Sulphur   Regal Fritillary   Perius Duskywing     Orange Sulphur   Edwards’ Fritillary   Common Checkered Skipper     Dog Face   Gorgone Checkerspot   Common Sootywing     Sleepy Orange   Silvery Checkerspot   Least Skipper     Dainty Sulphur   Sagebrush Checkerspot   Uncas Skipper     Gray Copper   Pearl Crescent   Western Branded Skipper     Bronze Copper   Question Mark   Leonard’s Skipper     Ruddy Copper   California Tortoiseshell   Pahaska Skipper     Purplish Copper   Mourning Cloak   Sachem     Coral Hairstreak   Milbert’s Tortoiseshell   Tawny-edged Skipper     Acadian Hairstreak   Red Admiral   Delaware Skipper     Striped Hairstreak   American Lady   Hobomok Skipper     Juniper Hairstreak   Painted Lady   Kiowah Skipper     Gray Hairstreak   West Coast Lady   Dusted Skipper     Reakirt’s Blue   Viceroy   Common Roadside Skipper     Eastern Tailed-Blue   Weidemeyer’s Admiral   Strecker’s Giant Skipper",
