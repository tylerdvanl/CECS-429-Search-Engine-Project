It also grants superintendents discretionary authority to develop park-specific rules inresponse to the special needs of resource protection, park programs or plans,and\/or the general public. Many Compendiums complement existing state and\/orlocal laws and regulations currently in effect in the park. The Compendium does not—nor cannot—replace or repeal existing state or federal laws.
