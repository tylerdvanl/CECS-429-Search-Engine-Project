    "body": "Explore This Park    Learn About the Park     History & Culture     Stories               Stories       The human history of Devils Postpile can deepen our appreciation for the area by revealing how people have valued and engaged with their environment over time. These stories are found in archeological sites, roads, trails, structures, and environmental features in the monument and the surrounding National Forest. They highlight the contested and changing meaning of nature in American history and provide glimpses into the conflicts, cooperation, and individual effort that have shaped the monument and the Middle Fork Valley. These stories are reminders that while the Postpile may have non-human origins, its significance cannot be considered independently from the human history of the Sierra Nevada and the history of American conservation.",
