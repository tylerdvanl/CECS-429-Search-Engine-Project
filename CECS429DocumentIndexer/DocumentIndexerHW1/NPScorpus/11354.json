In 1761 James Otis opposed the Writs of Assistance here, inspiring John Adams to state \"then and there the child independence was born.\" A cobblestone circle beneath its balcony marks the site of the 1770 Boston Massacre when British soldiers fired into a crowd of Bostonians. Fugitive slave Crispus Attucks was among the five victims who died that day. Today the Bostonian Society maintains the building as a museum of Boston history.   Hours & Admission: Visit the Bostonian Society web site for information on hours and fees. Small admission fee. Massachusetts schoolchildren free. Group rates available.
