The national preserve designation enables the land to be federally protected, but also allows for public hunting, trapping, fishing, oil and gas exploration, and subsistence use (although state permits for some of these activities are still required). If you are simply using the preserve for backpacking, hiking, biking, camping, climbing, hot spring soaking, or other low-impact activities however, it is yours to respectfully and responsibly enjoy!",
