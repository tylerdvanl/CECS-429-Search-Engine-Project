For an easy one-half mile walk, take the paved trail that starts near the gray structure that served as the Parkway's first concession stand. The trail loops through the picnic area to the Cumberland Knob Overlook shelter. (This shelter provides refuge from summer showers, but is not for overnight camping.) The elevation change is only 100 feet, making this a good trail for taking younger children.    Gully Creek Trail    Gully Creek Trail is strenuous but rewards hikers with views of a delightful mountain stream and the many plants that live along its cool, damp banks. The vegetation here contrasts sharply with that of the dryer mountain slopes. Hikers can begin at the old concession stand, although it may be easier to start from the Cumberland Knob Trail loop. Allow two hours.",
