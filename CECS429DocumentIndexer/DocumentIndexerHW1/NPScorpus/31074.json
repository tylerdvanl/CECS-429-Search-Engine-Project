Volunteers In Parks (VIPs) are public-spirited people of all ages, walks of life, and educational backgrounds. Though they are individually different, they share a common interest – a love for the national parks and a desire to impart their enthusiasm and knowledge to others. At Lyndon B. Johnson NHP, volunteers assist with a wide variety of duties and projects. Tasks include everything from working with the Hereford cattle and ranching operations to leading guided tours to assisting with museum collections to maintaining park facilities.            Information for Prospective Volunteers Housing RV sites with full hookups are available for VIPs in the park at no cost to the volunteer.
