    "body": "1b - Welcome Information          Welcome to Pipe Spring National Monument  Established in 1923, Pipe Spring National Monument commemorates pioneer and Indian life on the southwestern frontier. A fresh water spring on the site provided water for farming and daily life to ancestral Indians and Kaibab Paiute for centuries. In 1872 a fort was built over the spring by Mormon pioneers who used the spring and surrounding rangeland for cattle and sheep ranching.
