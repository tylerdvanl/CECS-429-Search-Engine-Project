We have made sure that our exhibits are fully wheel chair accessible.  Our theater, rest rooms and viewing deck are also fully wheel chair accessible.  Need a wheel chair? We have one you can barrow.   The park's trails are rough and narrow in places and may not always be accessible for wheel chairs, but the camp trail is the most accessible trail and also the most level trail.",
