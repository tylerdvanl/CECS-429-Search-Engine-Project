If you are towing a trailer, it will have to be unhitched and left at the visitor center. If you are driving an RV towing a vehicle, you will have to unhitch and drive the smaller vehicle to the rim.  Â    Oversized Vehicle Accommodation The Monument's compendium states the maximum size of a vehicle allowed on the Volcano Road is 26 feet in length and\/or 8 feet in width. We will try our best to accommodate visitors who have larger vehicles, but accommodation will depend upon staffing and the number of vehicles at the top of the volcano.",
