    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Things To Do     Special Events     Portsmouth Homecoming                 Portsmouth Homecoming      The Friends of Portsmouth Island, in cooperation with Cape Lookout National Seashore, sponsor an old-fashioned homecoming in Portsmouth Village, south of Ocracoke, across Ocracoke Inlet.  Homecomings are traditionally held in alternate years the first Saturday after Easter.  The next Homecoming is set for  Saturday, April 30, 2016 Everyone is welcome!         Traditionally, homecomings in the South are for the members of a particular church or family, but the Portsmouth Homecoming welcomes everyone. Usually, about half of the participants are first-timers. The village is open for visiting, and the program itself is followed by a traditional \"dinner on the grounds.\"         Getting to Portsmouth can be a challenge. Access is by water only and there are no hard surface roads on the island. Some people take the private vehicle ferry from the village of Atlantic, and then drive their four-wheel drive vehicles 17 miles up the beach to get to Portsmouth. Others arrive by their own boat. Most folks, however, catch the passenger ferry from the village of Ocracoke.         The homecoming service, traditionally held in the church, includes singing, special music, recognition of guests and other visitors, a short devotional, and good fellowship. Dress for the day is very informal; jeans are appropriate.     If you are planning on joining us for Homecoming, you will need to make your own reservations with the ferry service.  Information on planning a trip to Portsmouth, during Homecoming or at another time of year,  can be found on the Visiting Portsmouth Village webpage.For more details on the 2016 Homecoming -- check out the Friends of Portsmouth webpage.",
