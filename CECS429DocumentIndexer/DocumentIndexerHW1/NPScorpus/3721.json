    "body": "Junior Ranger         Junior Ranger logo NPS Image  Here at Fort Bowie National Historic Site we feel the future stewardship of our park is of the utmost importance. A Junior Ranger is an explorer. A Junior Ranger is a learner, and this type of learning is informal and fun. A Junior Ranger is a protector of the national parks. Junior Rangers discover things they can do to help make sure there are always parks to visit in the future. They learn things they can do in the parks, and things they can do when they return home. When they have completed their activity booklets, children are sworn in as a Junior Ranger and receive a badge, patch, and certificate. Each year 450,000 children become Junior Rangers.   Would you like to learn more about the animals, plants, history, and people at Fort Bowie National Historic Site?
