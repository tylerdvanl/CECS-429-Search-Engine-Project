Eastern National has been a valued partner of the National Park Service since 1947 and, in that time, has donated over $100 Million to the National Park Service and other public trusts. Eastern National currently operates educational retail outlets in 30 states, from Maine to the Caribbean. We see our mission as a double opportunity to offer quality educational materials and services to park visitors and the general public at fair prices, and to aid the National Park Service with the income derived from these activities. All of the products, programs and publications offered to visitors have a strong educational value and assist the educational programs of the Service.
