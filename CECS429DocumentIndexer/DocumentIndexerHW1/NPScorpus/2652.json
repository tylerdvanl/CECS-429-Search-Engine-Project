In spite of the small acreages of the Castle and Well units, together they support 379 species of plants. This is an impressive amount for a semiarid upland area with less than 12 inches of precipitation annually.  These plants not only support an incredible natural ecosystem, but tell the story of a millennium of continued use by local cultures.  We call that use ethnobotany; walk our trails and learn how the desert flora provides for our human needs.   We partner with the Southwest Environmental Information Network, or SEINet, to inventory the botanical resources of Montezuma Castle National Monument.
