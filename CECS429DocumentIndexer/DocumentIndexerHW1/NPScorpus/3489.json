Hundreds of these people make up a very special group who come to Glen Canyon National Recreation Area each year. They are Volunteers in Parks (VIPs) - stewards of the National Park Service. The reasons they share their services are different for each: love of Glen Canyon, wanting to do something positive, a strong sense of giving back and doing for others, care for the environment. Many of our volunteers return year after year because it is such a rewarding experience. We are always looking for lovers of Glen Canyon who want to give back. School groups and scout groups are always welcome. If you are looking for an opportunity to share your expertise, your knowledge, or your love of this wonderful place, consider becoming a National Park Service Volunteer.
