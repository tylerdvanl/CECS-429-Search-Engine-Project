C. Sanidas   We are looking for a few good teachers who want to learn about the National Park Service and Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore and then share what they have learned with their students in a very personal way. Teacher-Ranger-Teachers participate in a summer professional development experience in the park and assist the park's education staff with summer programming, developing new tools for educators, and receive a behind-the-scenes perspective to the national lakeshore. This is part of a nationwide program and is dependent on funding each year. The national lakeshore does not provide housing at this time for its teacher-ranger-teachers; therefore, local applicants or those who have local housing are preferred. To receive an application or learn more about this fun, fulfilling summer program, contact Education Specialist Christy Gerlach at 219-395-1885 or email her at christine_gerlach@nps.gov.",
