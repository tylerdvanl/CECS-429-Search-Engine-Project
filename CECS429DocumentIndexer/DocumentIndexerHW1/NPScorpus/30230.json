The park units do and this habitat quality is essential for frogs, toads, and salamanders. Frog and toad activity is noticeable by early spring when spring peepers, western chorus frogs, and American toads call. Activity continues through the warm late spring and summer months when Fowler’s toads, gray treefrogs, and American bullfrogs make their debut. Red-backed salamanders may be seen by wandering along wooded trails and looking under logs and rocks. In the 1\/3-acre pond at Hopewell Mound Group, the red-spotted newt spends a portion of its life along with green frogs and bullfrogs. Dry Run, an intermittent stream at the Hopeton Earthworks, provides habitat for the northern ravine salamander and northern two-lined salamander. Other species documented at the park through surveys are the northern leopard frog and Jefferson salamander. Although it has not been heard or seen on park grounds, visitors should keep their ears tuned for the call of the rare eastern spadefoot toads, as potential habitat does exist for them.      View the Amphibians Species List for the park.",
