In addition to its history, the park also contains many important natural resources. The development that has swept the Frederick area has also influenced the landscape and the organisms around the battlefield. Many habitats have been changed or destroyed around the park, and it now represents a sanctuary for many plant and animal species.   As part of a region-wide effort, the National Capital Region Inventory and Monitoring Network monitors natural resources in Monocacy National Battlefield.  They have collected and analyzed a wealth of information on the forests, birds, streams and other natural resources within the park.",
