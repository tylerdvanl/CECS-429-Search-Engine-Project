Visitors at each of these sites have an opportunity to experience the pristine waters of Sinking Spring and Knob Creek, view the varied wildlife and hike amid the hardwood forests of Central Kentucky.  The park is part of the Cumberland Piedmont Network which consists of 14 parks with diverse cultural and natural resources distributed across seven states and six different physiographic regions.",
