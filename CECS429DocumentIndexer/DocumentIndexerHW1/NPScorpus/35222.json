The Fruita Area is the most accessible district, offering views along the paved Scenic Drive (driving guide available at the bookstore), several hikes of varying lengths and difficulty, and access to the Fruita Historic District, including the orchards and the Gifford House Store and Museum.    The Waterpocket District offers amazing views of the Waterpocket Fold and great hiking and backpacking opportunities. The roads are unpaved, but can normally be accessed by standard passenger vehicles. Any precipitation can cause the roads to become impassable, so check weather and road conditions at the visitor center or by calling (435) 425-3791.    Cathedral Valley offers more of a backcountry experience, usually requiring a high-clearance vehicle to access the area's attractions. Any precipitation can cause the roads to become impassable, so check weather and road conditions at the visitor center or by calling (435) 425-3791.",
