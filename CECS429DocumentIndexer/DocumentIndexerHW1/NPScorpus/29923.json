    "body": "Business Plan        Fire Island National Seashore's Business Plan provides a snapshot of park operations and funding for Fiscal Year 2004. Some recommendations within the means of the Seashore's current staffing and budget levels are being implemented.        The purpose of business planning in the National Park Service (NPS) is to improve the ability of parks to more clearly communicate their financial status with principal stakeholders, including Congress and the American public. Like any other organization, Fire Island National Seashore must account for funds allocated through Congressional appropriations. This business plan helps communicate the park's financial status    1) by providing a synopsis of the park's funding history;  2) by providing a clear, detailed picture of the park's current park operations and funding; and 3) by outlining park priorities and funding strategies to improve its current situation.  Fire Island National Seashore's business plan uses the same methodology that is applied to other NPS units preparing business plans. The NPS goal is to integrate various management tools—including the Budget Cost Projection Model, Business Plans, Core Operations Analysis, and the Park Scorecard—to provide a more qualitative basis for decision-making.      You may view a copy of this booklet through the following links:  Complete Document  (1,153 KB PDF, screen version) Complete Document (21,584 KB PDF, print version)",
