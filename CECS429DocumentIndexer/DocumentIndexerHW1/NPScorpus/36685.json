Roanhorse 21 November, 2015.          The trail to Tower Bridge begins at Sunrise Point and heads northeast along the Fairyland Loop Trail. It is not a loop trail.   Tower Bridge Trail is considered a \"moderate hike\" due to the drop in elevation from the rim down to Tower Bridge site (950 ft\/290 m). The 3 mile (4.8 km) hike takes about 2-3 hours to complete.   Once at Tower Bridge one has the option of returning to Sunrise Point or continuing on farther around the Fairyland Loop (8 miles \/ 12.8 km total).     Recommend carrying plenty of water. Sunscreen for UV protection. Snakes & other animals are prevalent on this trail. DO NOT FEED OR HARASS WILDLIFE. Foot traction devices are strongly recommended in winter.            Back to main Day Hikes page. Back to main Moderate Hikes page.      Error: You have supplied an invalid NPMap ID.
