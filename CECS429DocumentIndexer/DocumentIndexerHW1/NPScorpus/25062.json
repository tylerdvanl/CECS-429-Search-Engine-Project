Even with the lure of free land, homesteading in the remote territory was slow to start due to poor weather and soils. By 1914, fewer than 200 homestead applications had filed in Alaska. But after WWII and the Vietnam War, a surge of homesteaders came to Alaska, looking for the same land ownership opportunities that lured settlers out to the western states 100 years before. They also encountered many of the same hardships as the 19th century pioneers such as lack of transportation, harsh weather and the dangers of local wildlife. The Homestead Act was repealed in 1976, but a provision of the repeal allowed for homesteading to continue in Alaska until 1986.       nps\/anch  Founders Day The National Park Service will celebrate its 97th birthday this coming Sunday!
