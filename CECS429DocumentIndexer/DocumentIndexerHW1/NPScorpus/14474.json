    "body": "Curriculum Materials       The challenges of frontier Kentucky life shaped the fundamental character Abraham Lincoln needed to lead the nation successfully through the trials of the Civil War. The National Park Service provides educational opportunities for classroom students through curriculum-based lesson plans for teachers. Thirty teachers from the tri-state area (Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois) at a 3 day workshop designed web-based teacher lesson plans with pre-visit, post-visit and long-distance learning options. These curriculum-based education programs are designed to engage students in learning about history, math, science and social studies.  Â    Illustrations of Young Abraham Lincoln used for Abraham Lincoln: Great Learner\/Great Leader and Women of the American Frontier were created by Lloyd Ostendorf and used with permission from his publisher Phillip H. Wagner, Wagner Office Systems of Springfield, Illinois. Funding for this project was provided by the following organizations:",
