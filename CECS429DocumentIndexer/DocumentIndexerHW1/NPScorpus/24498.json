These scenic drives provide access to dramatic views, a chance to see wildlife, or the ability to deeper explore the area by hiking one of the monument's trails. Some of the roads are paved two-lane highways – fine for any passenger car – while others are dirt roads requiring the use of a 4-wheel drive, high clearance vehicle. Some monument roads close for the winter. Always check the weather before heading out on any of the monument's dirt roads. Due to the clay soils, some roads may be impassible when wet.         Colorado Scenic Drives Utah Scenic Drives   Harpers Corner Road (paved) Tour of Tilted Rocks (mostly paved)   Echo Park Road (unpaved) Rainbow Park\/Island Park Road (unpaved)   Yampa Bench Road (unpaved)     Gates of Lodore (unpaved)     Deerlodge Park (paved)",
