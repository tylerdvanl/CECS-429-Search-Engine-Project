Stay low, avoid standing next to trees or on exposed ridges and hilltops, and seek shelter before the storm arrives. Elevation Headache, fatigue, and nausea can be symptoms of altitude sickness. To prevent altitude sickness, ascend slowly and drink plenty of water. Avoid strenuous activity until you are acclimated, particularly travelers with heart, lung, or kidney disease. Don’t Feed Animals Do not feed park animals. Though they appear cute and harmless, they are wild and will bite and scratch. In addition, they may carry diseases such as hantavirus and bubonic plague. Sun The sun is intense at high elevations. Use sun block and hats.       NPS Photo by Sheena Grabski",
