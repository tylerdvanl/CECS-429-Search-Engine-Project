The historic prison site is 26.5 acres outlined with double rows of white posts. Two sections of the stockade wall have been reconstructed, the north gate and the northeast corner. Located south of the National POW Museum, a tour road encircles the site, providing easy access to the the most important locations in the prison site. Roadside pull-offs and exhibits are located at the Wisconsin Monument, the North Gate, Providence Spring, the Star Fort, and the reconstructed northeast corner of the stockade. The historic prison site may be toured on foot or by car. If you drive, you may wish to use the audio tour, available for checkout at the museum information desk.      Self-guided Audio Tour A one hour audio driving tour of both the prison site and the National Cemetery is available as a free service to visitors.
