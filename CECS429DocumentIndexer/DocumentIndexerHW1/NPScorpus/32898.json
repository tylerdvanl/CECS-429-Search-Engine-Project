Key points include:  Maintaining access to existing developed areas, park trails, campgrounds, and facilities. Seeking additional partnerships to help provide enhanced visitor access and enjoyment (e.g. alternative transit options, expanded interpretive and educational opportunities) and better protection of sensitive resources; Boundary adjustments through willing sellers only, or land exchanges to incorporate sensitive resource areas within the park (e.g. fish habitat, wetlands); Continued protection of wilderness, natural and cultural resources.       Olympic National Park Long-Range Interpretive Plan This Long-Range Interpretive Plan outlines recommendations for future interpretive services, facilities, and media. Park staff, partners, and stakeholders worked together to develop this comprehensive tool.  It outlines educational and recreational opportunities for visitors to develop intellectual and emotional connections to the natural and cultural resources found within Olympic National Park. Our goal is to promote Olympic National Park’s resource values through planned visitor experiences and excellence in interpretation.",
