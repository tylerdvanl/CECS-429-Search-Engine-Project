She's come to be known as the Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island and is thought to have been of Gabrielino-Tongva descent.   San Nicolas Island is owned by the US Navy and closed to the public. But you can experience island isolation and the natural resources described in the book on the park's five islands.      The National Park Service and other partners are developing a web-based resource that will take readers and researchers to a vast amount of information relating to this woman and her story.      Until that resource is completed, here are links to information of interest:     Los Angeles Times article about recent exciting archeological discoveries on San Nicolas Island     Lone Woman information posted on the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History website     Research paper by Steven Schwartz, US Navy archeologistIsland of the Blue Dolphins Curriculum-based Live Broadcast from Anacapa Island    Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island and the San Nicolas Box Cache presentations from the 2012 California Islands Symposium",
