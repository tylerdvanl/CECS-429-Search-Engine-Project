    "body": "Minute Geyser          Â    Minute Geyser's eruptions have changed dramatically. Its larger west vent is clogged with rocks tossed in by early visitors when the park's main road was near this trail and passed within 70 feet of the geyser. Minute once erupted every 60 seconds, sometimes to heights of 40 to 50 feet (12 to 15 meters). Eruptions now are irregular and originate from its smaller east vent. Removal of the west vent's mineral-cemented rocks would require the use of heavy equipment resulting in severe damage. Minute Geyser's destruction stands today as a sad reminder of thoughtless behavior on the part of some visitors.  < Previous Stop | Next Stop >",
