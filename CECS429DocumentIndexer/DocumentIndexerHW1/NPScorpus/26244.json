Wise planning and keeping safety in mind can mean the difference between fun and frustration. Weather For current weather conditions at the park, visit the website of the National Weather Service. Before visiting, check the park's Alerts to see if weather or other conditions might impact your visit. In Case of Emergency If you encounter an emergency or unsafe situation or condition while onsite, please dial 9-1-1 and be sure to identify your location. The Vancouver Police Department and Vancouver Fire Department provide emergency services for park units in Vancouver, WA, and the Oregon City Police Department and Fire Department provide emergency services at the McLoughlin House Unit of Fort Vancouver NHS in Oregon City, OR. Planning Ahead  Check the weather and dress appropriately for the conditions. Rain gear is helpful during the winter rainy season, and sun protection (including sunscreen, hat, and sunglasses) and drinking water is a must during the hot summer months.   Trails and walkways can get slippery when wet or icy, so please take extra caution if you're visiting during inclement weather.   A visit to Fort Vancouver can require a significant time outdoors, whether walking between buildings or along marked trails, so consider wearing sturdy walking, hiking or running footwear.   Fort Vancouver is an active archaeology site, with uneven ground. Please be careful if you venture off trail in the park and be mindful of your footing.   Metal detecting and any type of ground disturbance is prohibited. If you see an artifact on the ground, please leave it in place and notify a staff member or call the park at 360-816-6230.   Snacks are available onsite at the AAFES Shoppette in East Barracks and meals are available at the Grant House Restaurant on Officers Row and a number of venues within walking distance of the park.   Dogs must be leashed at all times, and their waste must be collected and disposed of. No pets are allowed in national park facilities - including the reconstructed fort, Visitor Center, and Pearson Air Museum - with the exception of service animals.   Bicyclists must stay on designated roads and trails and yield to equestrians and hikers. Travel at a safe speed and let others know when you are passing. Always wear a helmet and carry a patch kit and pump.   Poison Oak can cause an itchy rash any time of the year. Avoid contact by learning to recognize it, staying on trails, and keeping your pet leashed. The leaves can be green or red and drop off during the fall and winter. Wash clothes separately and bathe thoroughly if you contact the plant. Several brands of skin treatments are available at most drug or outdoor stores.   Onsite, first aid is available inside the reconstructed fort at the Contact Station, at the Visitor Center, and at Pearson Air Museum.",
