Southeastern Arizona is an exciting area where opportunities to explore the natural and cultural history of the area abound all year. Our busiest season is from January to April when temperatures are mild. Summers are warmer with temperatures in the 90s, but cooling to the 60s at night after spectacular afternoon \"monsoon\" thunderstorms. Once the rains begin in July, the grasslands and oak woodlands become lush and green.
