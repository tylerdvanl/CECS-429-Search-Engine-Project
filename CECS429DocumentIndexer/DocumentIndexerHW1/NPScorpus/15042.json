Academic fee waivers are not granted automatically. Applicant groups must demonstrate that they qualify for the waiver. There are three requirements (listed below) that the group must meet to qualify for an academic fee waiver: eligibility, educational purpose, and relevancy of park resources or facilities. Requirement #1 - Educational Purpose Applicants must provide a written statement confirming that the visit supports a specific curriculum for which academic credit is offered. If the group is on a commercial tour, the applicant must state how the tour supports the curriculum. Requirement #2 - Relevance of Park Resources Applicants must provide a written explanation identifying the park resources and\/or facilities that will be used to support the educational purpose of the visit, and how they are relevant to that purpose. Requirement #3 - Eligibility Applicants must prove they are an academic or scientific institution by presenting one of the following types of documentation:  A statement confirming educational or scientific tax exemption from the IRS or the applicant's national, state, or local tax authority; or A statement from an academic institution that meets one of these eligibility standards confirming that the group is visiting for the purpose of providing transferable academic credit based on a curriculum; or,  A statement confirming accreditation or recognition as an educational institution from a qualified national, regional, state, or local authority.
