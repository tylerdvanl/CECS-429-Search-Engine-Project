The emphasis of this program is to link National Park units and teachers from schools with underserved student populations in urban and rural school districts. TRTs spend most of their time engaging with park education projects, learning about park resources, and developing lesson plans to use in their classrooms and in the park with students. The TRT program is administered through a partnership with the University of Colorado, Denver (CU Denver). While participating in the TRT program, teachers are considered \"student interns\" at CU Denver.
