Fairview Dome, West Face – Closure includes all routes between and including Heart of Stone to Lucky Streaks, until August 1. All other routes remain open.    Nest sites will be monitored to provide current information on nesting status and to ensure prompt re-opening of these areas. Closures are subject to change based on current nesting status.
