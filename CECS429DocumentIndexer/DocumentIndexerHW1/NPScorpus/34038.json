A bluebird program in the park is run in conjunction with volunteers from the Audubon Society. Bluebird nesting boxes have been placed in 14 locations around the park and are monitored through out the summer. An average of 40 fledglings are produced from these boxes each year. Sightings by park personnel included Common Grackle, Mourning Dove, House Finch, Red-bellied Woodpecker, Downy Woodpecker, House Wren, Pileated Woodpecker, Baltimore Oriole, Carolina Chickadee, Tufted Titmouse, White-breasted Nuthatch, Turkey Vulture, American Robin, American Crow, Northern Cardinal, Blue Jay, Chipping Sparrow, Common Flicker, Canada Goose, Wood Thrush, Red-eyed Vireo, Acadian Flycatcher, Black-throated blue warbler, Blue-grey gnatcatcher, Louisiana Waterthrush, Ovenbird, Red-shouldered hawk, Eastern Towhee and Eastern Bluebird.

The summary shows; the ten most common birds (and how common they are relative to each other), a map of bird monitoring plots rated for habitat quality, and a bird species list that notes species of conservation concern.
