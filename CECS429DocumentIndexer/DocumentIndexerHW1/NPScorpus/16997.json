    "body": "Camping       CAMPING IN DEVILS POSTPILE NATIONAL MONUMENT The monument features a 20-site first-come, first-served campground. Campers are exceptions to the mandatory shuttle bus system. OPERATING SEASON Due to delays with public works projects, the campground is still closed for the 2016 season. Please check back for campground opening date updates. FEES Campsites cost $20.00\/night. For Senior and Access pass holders, the fee is $10.00\/night. The fee can be paid by cash or check in US Dollars. Credit cards are not accepted. (Please note that the campsite fee is in addition to the standard amenity fee paid at the Minaret Vista Station.) No refunds will be issued for camping fees. RESERVATIONS Reservations are not available. OPERATING SEASON The Devils Postpile Campground is now closed for the season. It will re-open for the 2016 sometime in mid-June. AMENITIES The campground features flush toilets and running water. Each site is equipped with a picnic table, firepit, and bear-proof locker. Showers and RV hook-ups and dump stations are not available. Showers are available at Reds Meadow Resort and in Mammoth Lakes at Mammoth Mountain and the Mammoth Lakes RV Park. RVs & CAMPERS There is a limit of 37 feet for all vehicles on the Devils Postpile Road and in the campground. Only a few of the monument's campsites can accommodate campers and trailers over 30 feet in length. (On average, most site lengths range between 20 and 25 feet.) Anything larger than that is not advisable. In addition, the small size of the campground and its two loops makes negotiating turns with an extra long vehicle very challenging. If arriving in a large vehicle or towing a large trailer, the safest time to travel the road is early morning or evening, due to reduced traffic. During shuttle bus season, we recommend that large RVs follow a shuttle bus down the road.  RULES AND REGULATIONS Campsites are limited to six people per site per night and two vehicles. Additional vehicles may be parked in the overnight parking lot just outside of the monument boundary (approximately a 3-5 minute walk down an easy trail).  Quiet hours are from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. During this time campers should avoid excessive noise, generator use, and other activities that would disturb neighboring campers. Tents must be set up on the tent pads provided and must not be set up on any vegetation. Vehicles should not be parked on vegetation or in any way that blocks the flow of traffic. Pets are allowed in the campground, but must remain on a leash or otherwise physically restrained at all times. Camping must be limited to 14 days per stay. Fires are only permitted in designated fire rings. Please make sure all fires are completely out and cool to the touch before leaving your site. Proper food storage is required. Anything with an odor must be kept in the bear proof lockers which are located at each site. Sites must be paid for within 30 minutes of occupation and property at that site must not be left unattended for more than 24 hours.  GETTING A SITE The campground at Devils Postpile usually fills on weekends. If you are looking for a site on July 4th weekend or Labor Day weekend, it is advised that you arrive before noon the Friday prior to the holiday weekend. Late July through mid-August are the busiest times in the campground and finding a site during that stretch can be challenging. Monday-Wednesday tend to be the slowest days in the campground and sites are usually available, however, this varies from summer to summer. The B-Loop usually fills first, as that loop is closest to the river. Check out time is at 12 p.m. and all sites must be paid for within 1\/2 hour of occupying the site. Once you have chosen and paid for a site, if you need to switch sites for some reason, please do not do so without notifying a ranger or leaving a note in the fee box.  OTHER CAMPGROUNDS IN THE AREA Outside of the monument, there are seven Forest Service campgrounds located within Reds Meadow Valley. From north to south, these are: Agnew Meadows*, Agnew Meadows Group*, Agnew Meadows Horse*, Upper Soda Springs, Pumice Flat, Pumice Flat Group, Minaret Falls, and Reds Meadow campgrounds. Sites in these campgrounds are $22 per site per night. All of these campgrounds are first-come, first-served with the exception of the Agnew Group and Horse Camp as well as Pumice Group.
