    "body": "Animals       Big Thicket National Preserve is a wonderland of plant and animal species that come together in southeast Texas. Wildlife species common to the eastern deciduous forests, the central plains grasslands, the southeastern coastal swamplands, the pine savannas, and even a few from the southwestern deserts all come together in this crossroad area of North America. With a little planning and driving, visitors can easily see many of the varied plant communities with their associated mix of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish in just a dayâ€™s visit. However, to truly experience the variety, come in the spring or fall to enjoy a hike on a trail in the Thicket or plan a canoe\/kayak trip down one of the creeks or on the Neches River in the summer. The sounds of a chorus of frogs, the sighting of a log full of basking turtles, the shadow of a bald eagle or anhinga flying overhead, or the chatter of a busy squirrel in the trees above will all make your visit to Big Thicket an experience you will always remember.",
