NPS Photo   Â    Traditional climbing is permitted on the Mt. Tammany and Mt. Minsi cliff faces, and at Ricks Rocks along Rt. 602 in New Jersey there are opportunities for top roping.  Many waterfalls in the park, including Buttermilk Falls, and the cascades near Dingmans Ferry and Slateford Farm, are sometimes suitable in winter for ice climbing.   All forms of climbing are inherently dangerous, irrespective of your experience or conditions. Please take every reasonable precaution before setting out, including notifying someone of your intended activities and whereabouts.  Guidebooks for local climbing opportunities may be found at Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area visitor centers, in the bookstores maintained by Eastern National.",
