On the first Saturday of each month, Obed Wild and Scenic River conducts the award-winning \"Coffee and Climb with a Ranger.\" Bring any questions you have and come join National Park Service rangers for a free cup of coffee. If you have ever wanted to try the sport of rock climbing, but did not know where to begin, let us help eliminate some of the uncertainty for you. When and Where:  -- 10:00 am-10:30 am (ET): Join a park ranger for a free cup of coffee at Lilly Bridge. -- 11:00 am-12:00 pm (ET): There will be a dedicated children-only climb for children ages 12 and under. -- 12:00 pm-2:00 pm (ET): Visitors of all ages are encouraged to attend at any time during this timeframe.    What you need to bring: We provide all of the gear. All that you need to bring is drinking water, sturdy footwear, a willingness to try new things and a can-do attitude.   Parking: Participants should park on either side of Lilly Bridge, take the path near the west end of the bridge labelled “Bridge Trail” and follow the signs to the climbing area. If parking is full at Lilly Bridge, participants should park in one of the Lilly Overlook parking lots. From the overlook parking lots, participants should follow the wide, gravel “Overlook Trail,” turn right on the “Bridge Trail” and then follow the trail that stays closest to the cliff base until arriving at the climbing area.   Depending on participant interests and ability levels, we will travel to one of several different climbing areas around the park and will have participants back to their vehicles by approximately 3 pm (ET).  Would-be rock climbers of all ages are encouraged to attend.   In the event of inclement weather, call the park visitor center at 423-346-6294 for more information, or follow us at @ObedNPS on Twitter for updates.   Attend one program or both. No reservations are necessary for these free events. For more information regarding these events, please contact the Obed Visitor Center.",
