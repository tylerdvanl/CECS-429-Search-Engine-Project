NPS       Scientific Name Bison bison Identification  Bison can reach huge sizes, standing 60-73 inches (152-186cm) tall at the shoulder and reaching up to 14.5 feet (4.41m) long, including the tail.  Males are larger than females. They have thick, dark chocolate-brown fur, often longer around the face. Both sexes have relatively short horns that curve upward, with males having slightly larger horns than females. A dominant hump protrudes well above the head on the back close to the front shoulder.  Calves are a much lighter, reddish-tan color and never stray far from their parents.  Habitat   Historically, bison lived in most of the United States, stretching in a massive triangle from Mexico to Georgia to Northwest Canada. Bison in the Grand Canyon live in the meadows and open woodlands of the North Rim and surrounding National Forest.  Behavior    Bison are active throughout the day, and are usually seen in large herds. Within Grand Canyon National Park, these herds can be as large as several hundred bison. The dominant shoulder hump is largely muscle, which allows them to use their heads like snowplows in the winter, removing snow from the grasses they eat. They feed primarily on grasses and sedges. The lack of preferred food on the South Rim- and the geographic barrier of the Canyon itself-limits bison to the North Rim of the park. Bison can be aggressive and can run at up to 35 mph (56 kph).        More Information  Current research by park biologists is aimed at studying how bison should be managed in the Grand Canyon.",
