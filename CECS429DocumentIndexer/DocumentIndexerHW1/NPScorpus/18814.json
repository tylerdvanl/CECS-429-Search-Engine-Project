The summit of Haleakalā (Red Hill) was the site of various installations; the first, a fixed radar station associated with the Aircraft Warning Service system.  The Army also built a base camp for personnel stationed at the Summit on a six-acre site near Pu'u Nianiau.  The Puʻu Nianiau base camp was turned over to the NPS in 1946.  Red Hill was returned to the NPS in 1948; however, the dilapidated military buildings and antennae were not removed until 1961.
