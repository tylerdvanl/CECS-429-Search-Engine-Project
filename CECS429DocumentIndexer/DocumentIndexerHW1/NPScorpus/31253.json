NPS Photo  Paddling the Canadian River and Lake Meredith can be a fun way to explore Lake Meredith National Recreation Area! From quiet, leisurely trips down the Canadian River to strength-training paddles across the windy lake, any paddler, from novice to expert can find a perfect experience on the Lake! In years of high water levels, canoes and kayaks can be put in at the Mullinaw crossing and you can paddle your way all the way to the Fritch Fortress or Sanford-Yake boat ramps. As added bonuses, canoes and kayaks often can navigate the more narrow, shallow channels that motorized boats cannot, and these activities can improve upper body strength, reduce stress levels, and aide in weight loss plan. Non-motorized vessels such as canoes and kayaks do not need registration. Remember that most people capsize at least once, so make sure your PFDs (life jackets) are in good condition and worn properly.  Â      Visitors enjoy a guided kayak trip through Spring Canyon. NPS Photo  If you are new to kayaking, or don't have your own equipment, the park offers ranger-guided kayak trips in Spring Canyon throughout the summer and fall, weather permitting.
