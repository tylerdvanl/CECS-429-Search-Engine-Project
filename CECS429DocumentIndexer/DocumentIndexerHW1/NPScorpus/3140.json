Instead, it is believed to belong to a group of small, inconspicuous birds from Eurasia and Africa. The male verdin may build several spherical nests of bulky twigs before the female chooses one in which to lay her eggs.  Young verdins are ready to fledge about three weeks after hatching but still return to the nest at night. Length: 4.5 in. Wingspan: 6.5 in. Diet: Insects and nectar",
