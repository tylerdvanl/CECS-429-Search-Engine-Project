For more information, please contact Dr. Herb Meyer (herb_meyer@nps.gov) or Conni O'Connor (conni_o'connor@nps.gov).         Mudroom This is the area where fossils are brought into the paleontology wing and where research experiments are conducted. Some of the resources available include a ventilation system and a flammables cabinet for chemicals as well as  microscopes for research and preparation. This area also holds all of the field excavation and inventory monitoring equipment used by the monument.         Collections More than 10,000 fossils are housed in the monument's secured collections room where they are organized stratigraphically. This room also houses extensive photography equipment for macro- or microphotography.. Some low resolution images of the fossils held in this collection can be found here. Researchers needing higher resolution images should contact Dr. Herb Meyer (herb_meyer@nps.gov).            Research and office space Additional computers are available with access to the collections database, Adobe Design and Web Premium, ArcGIS, and Microsoft Office. This area serves as the museum technician's office, and during the summer it is also office space for all of the paleontology interns. When space is available it may also be used for visiting researchers.",
