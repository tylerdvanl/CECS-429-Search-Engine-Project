    "body": "Donate       At Great Sand Dunes, there are two ways to financially support the park. You may contribute to Friends of the Dunes, or directly donate to the national park. Either way, your support will be used to benefit the park's resources, facilities, and programs.         Friends of the Dunes is a non-profit citizen's support group for Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve. In cooperation with the National Park Service, the Friends provide a forum for citizen involvement in planning decisions, focus public interest on issues and need, and provide volunteer and financial aid for projects beyond the scope of the park's budget. Support Friends of the Dunes!         Monetary donations are graciously accepted and directly benefit Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve. These funds are used for interpretation, visitor services and safety, as well as resource management programs. If desired, you may specify a use for your donation. For example, if you or someone you know has been involved in a search and rescue (SAR), donations may be made to directly support the park's SAR program.  Donations may be made by check or money order made payable to \"National Park Service.\" Send to:   Superintendent Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve 11500 State Highway 150 Mosca, CO 81146  If you are making a donation in someone's honor, please include the name and address of that person and they will receive an acknowledgement note. Thanks for your support of our mission to conserve park resources and provide for the enjoyment of Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve!",
