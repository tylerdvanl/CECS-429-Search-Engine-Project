Historic photographs captured steamships, early settlements, ranger activities, recreation and explorations. St. Thomas, the once submerged town, is also included in the artifact and photo sections of the Virtual Museum. The park doesn’t have a brick and mortar museum; therefore visitors have been unable to see the park’ artifacts, until now. The Virtual Museum, allows the virtual visitor to explore these photographs and artifacts online.",
