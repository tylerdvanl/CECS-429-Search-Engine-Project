Details about road closures.  Â    Tredyffrin Township owns and operates the Wilson Road Force Main, a sanitary sewer pipeline that runs for 3.6 miles through Valley Forge NHP. The pipe parallels Valley Creek and the Schuylkill River. Although the pipe runs through the park, it serves the residents of six municipalities upstream of the park. The 40-year old pipe has failed three times recently, releasing as much as 18 million gallons of untreated sewage into the creek and river. As a result of a consent decree with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the township is working on a major rehabilitation project to reline the force main. For additional up-to-date information on the force main project, please visit the Tredyffrin Township webpage.",
