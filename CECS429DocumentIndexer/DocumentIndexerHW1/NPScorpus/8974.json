To accomplish this, the park has installed a permanent Assistive Listening Device at the Philip A. Hart Visitor Center Information Desk. A compact TTY device is also available for use at the Visitor Center's pay telephone. For interpretive programs in the visitor center, ranger-led walks out on the trail, or for the evening programs in the campgrounds, portable wireless FM Assistive Listening Devices are also available. A portable wireless device is also available at the Glen Haven General Store. Rangers are trained in the use of this technology.
