NPS\/Bill Hayden  Pets are members of our families, but there are some things you should be aware of before bringing your pet to the park.  Pets are allowed in developed areas, in frontcountry campgrounds and picnic areas, along roads, in parking areas, and in boats on lakes where motorized watercraft are permitted.  Pets are not permitted on trails, along lake shores, in the backcountry, or in any building.  Pets must be on a leash no longer than 6 feet (1.8 m), under physical restraint, or caged at all times, including while in open-bed pickup trucks.  Pets are not to be left tied to an object when unattended.  Pet owners must pick up after their pets and dispose of waste in a trash receptacle. Owners must not allow a pet to make noise that is unreasonable. When the bike path between Apgar and West Glacier is free of snow dogs are allowed on leash. When roads are closed to vehicle traffic, they are considered a backcountry trail and dogs are not allowed.",
