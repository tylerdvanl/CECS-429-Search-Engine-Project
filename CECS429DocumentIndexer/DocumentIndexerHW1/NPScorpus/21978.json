Hook-ups are available in the Morefield Campground for volunteers with RVs from late spring to early fall. To qualify for housing or RV space, you must be willing to commit at least 30 hours a week for the duration of a project or the majority of the summer season, as determined by Mesa Verde National Park. A personal motor vehicle is a necessity for park volunteers. The park road (from the Mesa Verde Visitor and Research Center at the entrance, to the Chapin Mesa Archeological Museum at park headquarters) is 21 miles long. The nearest communities are at least 10 miles from the park entrance and about 30 miles from the Chapin Mesa area.         Volunteering at Other Federal and State Agencies  To find out about volunteering opportunities in many other federal and state agencies, visit www.volunteer.gov.",
