Blind\/Low Vision Accessibility Visitor center exhibits include audio recordings and tactile models, rock samples, and maps that may be touched. Recorded descriptions of exhibits or waysides are not available at this time. Service Animals Service animals are allowed in national parks. For a definition of a service animal, please visit the ADA Regulations on Service Animals. Owners are encouraged to identify their working service animal, such as with a vest. Identification is not required, but helps prevent unwarranted \"dog on trail\" complaints from other visitors. There are no plastic bags provided at trailheads for waste products, so please bring your own. Caution! The high plains ecosystem can be deadly for pets. Car temperatures rise quickly in the sun, even on cool days. Your pet can easily die of heat exhaustion. If you are leaving a pet in a car, crack the windows as much as possible and leave water to drink. We recommend you not leave pets in the car at all when the outside temperature exceeds 68 degrees, even with the windows cracked.",
