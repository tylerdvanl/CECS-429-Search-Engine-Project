Water drops 100 feet over rock outcroppings and collects in a small pool where numerous well-camouflaged salamanders can be found.  The trail to the waterfall gains over 2,000' in elevation over its 4 mile course and the 8-mile roundtrip hike is considered strenuous in difficulty. It follows rushing rivers and streams for much of its length. The last 2 miles pass through old-growth cove hardwood forest with large tuliptrees, basswoods, silverbells, and yellow birches.  Do not attempt to climb to the top of the falls. Several people have been killed trying to do so.  Access Trail: Ramsey Cascades Trail in the Greenbrier area  Trailhead: Drive six miles east of Gatlinburg on Highway 321 and turn at the Greenbrier entrance to the park.
