They live in shallow, clear water, allowing enough light for them to photosynthesize, just like land plants. They spread primarily through the growth of roots and rhizomes, often forming large meadows in sandy or muddy substrate. These root systems help stabilize sediment and reduce shoreline erosion. Boat anchors and propellers cause great damage to seagrass beds.  Anchors can rip out the roots and gouge holes that undermine the surrounding root systems.
