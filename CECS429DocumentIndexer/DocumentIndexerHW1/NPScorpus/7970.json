Please be aware that trail conditions may change suddenly and unexpectedly. Bear activity, severe storms, and downed trees may temporarily close trails. When hiking, carry water, a raincoat or poncho, and a first aid kit. Hike with another person. Be sure to allow plenty of time to complete your hike before dark. As a rule of thumb, hikers travel about 1.5 miles per hour. Many people travel slower. Sunset times vary from just after 5:00 p.m. in December to almost 9:00 p.m. in June.
