    "body": "Laws & Policies       Establishment of the National Trails System   The National Trails System Act authorized a feasibility study for a \"Potomac Heritage Trail,\" subsequently completed and published by the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation in 1974. In 1983 an amendment to the Act (P.L. 98-11) recognized a corridor for development of the Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail based on the narrative and a generalized map in the feasibility study. Such \"authorizing\" legislation for the Trail states that, initially, the Trail will be \"within the external boundaries of federal facilities.\" The Act also authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into agreements with various entities for management of Trail segments. The Departmental Manual delegates responsibility for administration to the National Park Service.  Â    Firearm Regulations As of February 22, 2010, federal law makes possession of firearms in national parks subject to local and state firearms laws.
