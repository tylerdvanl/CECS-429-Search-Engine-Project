Photos by Thomas Strom and Christopher Boykin       Family Fun Fest is a free public program held on the second Sunday of every month from December through April. Each month, a different aspect of the park's diverse resources is highlighted at five hands-on activity stations located around the Dante Fascell Visitor Center. Participants receive a \"passport\" that they get punched as they complete each station. Those who get all five punches earn a specially-designed button to remember their day. Special activities for toddlers at Family Fun Fest Junior help make sure that the entire family gets to learn and have fun.      Family Fun Fest is made possible through funding provided by Park Visitor Donations and the Bobby Duryea Memorial Fund at the South Florida National Parks Trust, with additional support from the Biscayne Bay Aquatic Preserves, local businesses and organizations, and a host of dedicated volunteers.      Family Fun Fest 2015-2016: Find Your Park The National Park Service celebrates its 100th birthday in 2016, so the 16th season of Family Fun Fest will highlight Biscayne's connections to some of the 407 other national parks out there so you can Find Your Park!\" The 2015-2016 themes are:  Find Your Park — December 13, 2015 — 1 - 4 p.m. Discover a national park (or two!) that's absolutely perfect for you!
