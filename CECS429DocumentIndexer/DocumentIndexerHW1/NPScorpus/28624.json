Want your students to learn directly from primary sources and from the fields of battle, but can't get to Gettysburg? Our new Virtual Field Trip opportunities allow your students to direct what they want to learn and see and ask…right from your classroom! Your students choose the focus question they want to investigate, and then the virtual field trip begins:  They will receive a set of primary source documents to review that will help them develop questions for the ranger, and begin to develop supported answers to the focus question; You will show a 15-minute YouTube video of the program sites as a park ranger investigates the focus question; Students will participate in a virtual question-and-answer session with the ranger, using the documents and video to prepare their questions in advance.  Once all three parts of the program are concluded, your students will have everything they need to develop and support with evidence their answer to the focus question - a skill set outlined in Common Core, National Council for the Social Studies, and other curriculum standards.
