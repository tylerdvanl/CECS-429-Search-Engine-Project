Visitors can watch as glass artisans make green glass wine bottles, similar to those found at Jamestown, and other items. These include vases, pitchers, candleholders, wine glasses and paper weights, just to name a few. These items are available for purchase and a portion of all sales comes back to the National Park Service. So any purchase helps support the Glassblowing demonstrations and the National Park Service at Historic Jamestowne.        Glassblower forming the neck to a wine bottle   Today the glass furnaces are heated by natural gas, rather than by wood as in 1608, but modern glassblowers use tools and techniques similar to those used by the early glassblowers. However, 17th century glass manufacturing techniques do not prepare the glass for modern-day use. Microwave ovens, automatic dishwashers and hot liquids may cause our production glassware to crack, break and shatter. All of our glassware carries the following warning: DO NOT USE THIS GLASSWARE IN THE AUTOMATIC DISHWASHER OR MICROWAVE OVEN. IT IS NOT FOR USE WITH HOT LIQUIDS.        Sample of glass products sold at Jamestown's Glasshouse NPS Image  No full scale catalog of what is produced at the Glasshouse is offered. Each piece of green glass was hand blown at Historic Jamestowne, Virginia, only a few yards from the site on which English Colonist first made glassware in 1608. Fragments of the original green glass have provided the key to proper color and composition, so that the glass has the same appearance today, as it did originally. Each piece is unique and one of a kind, as no two pieces are identical. There is a distinctive mark on the bottom of the glass which is called the pontil mark and is a sign of hand blown glass.        Display area in Jamestown's Glasshouse Gift Shop NPS Image  You may purchase glass items produced in our glasshouse through on-site sales, regular mail, phone and e-mail. Hours of operation are 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. daily, except Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day and New Years Day when Historic Jamestowne is closed.
