    "body": "Former Coliseum Property        Richfield Coliseum NPS Collection       The section of SR 303 just west of I-271 has experienced dramatic changes during the past century. What began as a row of farms, transformed into sharp angles of concrete and a field of pavement as the Richfield Coliseum rose above the treetops. Those who stayed on their land had a close up view of the huge arena's rise and eventual fall. By the early 21st century, Congress adjusted the boundaries of Cuyahoga Valley National Park to include the vacant Coliseum property. Following a dramatic demolition, the site was restored to nature, home to swaying grasses and singing birds. Farming Before the Richfield Coliseum, several farms occupied the over 327-acre site. The Bigelow, Roller, and Emmett families owned the largest farms on SR 303. These farmers raised vegetables, pigs, sheep, chickens, and Herford cattle. By the late 1960s, most families, including the Bigelows and Rollers, had sold the last of their farms to Nick Mileti, the owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Built for the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team, the Coliseum also hosted concerts and other memorable events. Surrounding residents heard the rumble of rock bands, battled heavy traffic, and even witnessed circus elephants walking up SR 303.          In Their Own Words Click the topics to hear stories about Cuyahoga Valley life.

To protect the neighboring national park and small communities from a major commercial development on their doorstep, they worked with the Trust for Public Land which acquired the property and oversaw the site's transformation. Workers tore up 80 acres of asphalt parking lots, swung the wrecking balls that demolished the arena, and added 5,000 pounds of topsoil. As originally planned, The Trust for Public Land soon transferred ownership to Cuyahoga Valley National Park, which restored the property as natural habitat. Sixty acres of grassland now attract several species of rare birds, including the bobolink, Savannah sparrow, and eastern meadowlark.      Click on the links to discover more:    Former Coliseum Property Conrad Botzum Farmstead Point Farm Welton Farm Heritage Farms",
