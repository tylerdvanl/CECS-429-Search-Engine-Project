Frank  Dark night skies are environments undisturbed by light and air pollution. Dark night skies have natural, cultural, and scenic importance. Wildlife is impacted by light pollution because animals often depend on darkness in order to hunt, conceal their location, navigate, or reproduce. For nocturnal animals, light pollution also means habitat disruption. Additionally, many species have far more sensitive vision than humans. Plants are affected by artificial light because it disrupts their natural cycles. Dark night skies are also culturally important because they are a resource common to all cultures on Earth, and are a metaphor for countless myths and religions. They have inspired innumerable works of art, literature, and connections to the cosmos. Natural lightscapes, including dark night skies, are a scenic resource integral to many people's Waterton-Glacier experience. Currently, two-thirds of Americans cannot see the Milky Way from their backyard, and if current light pollution trends continue, there will be almost no dark skies left in the contiguous United States by 2025. Many people seek national parks to experience this vanishing resource. Waterton-Glacier hopes to provide and preserve this important opportunity by meeting the requirements and objectives of Dark Sky Parks. If successful, this designation will be the first multi-national dark sky preserve and will be given in conjunction and with the approval of two organizations: the International Dark Sky Association and the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. The nomination process requires a long-term commitment to preserving dark skies and requires the parks to meet specific objectives. These include preservation or restoration of outstanding night skies, protection of nocturnal habitat, public enjoyment of the night sky and its heritage, and demonstrating environmental leadership on dark sky issues by communicating the importance of dark skies to the general public and surrounding communities, and by providing an example of what is possible.        NPS Graphic  Half the Park Happens After Dark  The National Park Service has collaborated with several partners—the Glacier National Park Conservancy, the International Dark Sky Association, the NPS Night Sky Program, and the Big Sky Astronomy Club—to provide park-wide night time viewing events, as well as daytime viewing of the sun. Park educational programs like \"Half the Park Happens After Dark\" provide participants with an opportunity to see the night sky in all its glory using sophisticated telescopes, in a location with a minimal number of artificial lights.  Check the Ranger-led Activity Schedule for dates and times. Programs take place throughout the summer at St. Mary and Apgar. Special Logan Pass Star Parties will be announced too.       Sighting Opportunities Step outside to see the International Space Station from Earth. As the third brightest object in the sky the space station is easy to see if you know when to look up. Visible to the naked eye, it looks like a fast-moving plane only much higher and traveling thousands of miles an hour faster!",
