The fire was finally contained 99 days later on November 6 and was declared out in the month that followed. At one point, there were over 3,700 fire personnel assigned and the fire grew over 10,000 acres per day.  With help from from NPS Volunteer Tyler Vitale, the Fire Information Office at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks created a series of video vignettes to share the story of the Rough Fire.  Each vignette tells just one part of this massive wildfire that affected so many lives. Videos will be added over the weeks as they are released, so please keep checking back in.
