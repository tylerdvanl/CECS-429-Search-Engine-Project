Some of these occur seasonally, so please read more about our interpretive programs or call 361-949-8069 for more information. Junior Ranger Program The Junior Ranger program is intended for young people, from age 5 to 13. A free booklet is provided that contains activities to help the participant learn about what makes Padre Island National Seashore so special, along with the park's plants, animals, and unique history.  A park ranger reviews the booklet and swears in the participant as an official National Park Service Junior Ranger.  Junior Rangers are awarded a badge for completion of the booklet and an additional patch if they participate in a beach clean-up.
