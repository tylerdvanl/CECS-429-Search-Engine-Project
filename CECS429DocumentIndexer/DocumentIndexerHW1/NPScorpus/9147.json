The stream has long been popular among fly fishermen. It is the birth place of the Brotherhood of the Jungle Cock, an organization dedicated to helping young people understand and appreciate the sport of angling and the resources upon which it depends. Big Hunting Creek was first in the State of Maryland to be designated as a fly-fishing only stream. Later it became Maryland's first catch-and-return trout stream. The Potomac Valley Fly Fishermen and the Maryland Fly Anglers stock Big Hunting Creek with rainbow and brook trout. Maryland DNR stocks Big Hunting Creek Lake, Frank Bentz Lake, and Owens Creek downstream from the park.  Anglers will find brook, brown, and rainbow trout in Big Hunting Creek. All three species spawn in the stream. For detailed regulations, closure dates, and stocking schedules, consult the Maryland trout fishing website, or view the Maryland sport fishing guide.
