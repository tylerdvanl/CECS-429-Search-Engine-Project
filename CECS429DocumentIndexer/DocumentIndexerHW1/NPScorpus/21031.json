Duration:2 minutes, 29 seconds                                The Peregrine Falcons of Cabrillo National Monument In ecosystem management and conservation, a fair number of challenges often arise such as conflicts between species. In collaboration with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Raptor Biologist, Dr. Joel ‘Jeep’ Pagel, we have been monitoring a probable scuffle whereby local populations of endangered California Least Terns (Sternula antillarum browni) are being preyed upon by our resident Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus). Understanding more about these species and their interactions will allow us to develop solutions in the equal interest of both groups to best remedy these conflicts.  To learn more about Dr. Pagel and his work with Peregrine Falcons, visit: http:\/\/globalraptors.org\/grin\/ResearcherResults.asp?lresID=460   Duration:4 minutes, 8 seconds                                The Mysterious Appearance of Leopard Sharks at Cabrillo NM Excursions to the rocky intertidal zone can reveal a vast diversity of marine life. However, in remote sections of Cabrillo's intertidal habitat, park biologists and volunteers have recently discovered a most unusual group of visitors. Aggregating in large numbers, juvenile Leopard Sharks (Triakis semifasciata) scout the shallow seagrass beds for their crustacean and mollusk prey. Though commonly observed in other areas of San Diego County, we are currently working alongside local shark expert, Dr. Andy Nosal of Scripps Institute of Oceanography, to investigate their latest attraction to our waters. To learn more about Dr. Nosal and his research group, visit: http:\/\/cmbc.ucsd.edu\/People\/Students\/nosal\/   Duration:3 minutes, 37 seconds                                Science in Action: Snails in Cages Select species of seaweeds generate noxious chemicals to defend themselves against would be predators. One such species, the rockweed (Silvetia compressa), can be found atop rocky outcrops throughout Cabrillo National Monument’s intertidal zone. In partnership with the United States Navy and Cabrillo biologists, Dr. Jeremy Long from San Diego State University investigates the intricate interactions between this brown seaweed and the prevalent black turban snail, Tegula funebralis. Dr. Long’s research will provide a better understanding of these chemically driven interactions and how they influence the larger ecosystem.

Each year the National Park Service recognizes exceptional efforts in volunteer management and service. Cabrillo was selected out of 401 national parks across the country for this high honor.

Carrying out this important task, the Preservation and Skills Training Program (PAST) mentors NPS personnel on preservation techniques, theories, and methods. Here at Cabrillo National Monument, Chief of Maintenance, Charles Schultheis, and the PAST team work diligently to preserve our park's historic and military landmarks, including the iconic Point Loma Lighthouse.

Duration:2 minutes, 29 seconds                                Science in Action: Shaw’s Agave Scattered across the landscape here at Cabrillo National Monument, the conspicuous Shaw’s Agave (Agave shawii) portrays a perfect example of the plight of global pollinators and the consequences of their decline to those that rely on them. Low replenishment of new individuals to the Agave population represents the threat of greatest concern, leading Cabrillo biologists to investigate this striking decline and it’s potential causes. This work supports a federal effort to understand and protect these native plant communities and those dependent on them. The National Park Service strives to foster resilient ecosystems, ensuring the well-being of current and future generations.

Cabrillo Artist-in-Residence Michael Ready masterfully captures the morphology of his subjects while building an awareness for the biodiversity of the region. These select images include some of the commonly occurring and easily discovered species, and others that are rarely seen due to their small size, ephemeral existence, or natural behavior. Merging the worlds of science and art, SEE LIFE challenges visitors to take a closer look and garner a deeper appreciation for the diverse world that surrounds them.
