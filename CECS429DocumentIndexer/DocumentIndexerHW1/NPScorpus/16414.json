The area enclosed by this sturdy fence was an irrigated field; park managers are restoring native plants NPS       In 1932, President Hoover added more than 7,000 acres of land to Yellowstone National Park to provide low-elevation winter wildlife habitat near Gardiner, Montana. The addition included 700 acres of irrigated agricultural fields. Park managers stopped irrigating the fields and planted an nonnative perennial grass, crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum), that they hoped would tolerate the arid conditions and provide wildlife forage. It thrived for many decades, but was never suitable forage. Eventually another, more aggressive, nonnative plant—an annual mustard, desert alyssum (Alyssum desertorum)—moved in. Alyssum germinates very early and uses up most of the soil moisture before other species even get started. It also exudes a chemical that inhibits soil bacteria needed by native plants. Park managers are restoring native vegetation to this area, following recommendations of arid land restoration specialists. In 2008 and 2009, they fenced four pilot plots totaling 50 acres, where they are controlling nonnative plants with herbicides and growing cover crops to increase soil organic matter and moisture-holding capacity and restore soil microbial communities. After two to three years, they will seed the plots with native species. Managers expect the fencing to remain for 10 to 15 years while the native plants become established. The fencing prevents elk and other ungulates from grazing on the young plants. Restoration of this area will proceed in multi-year phases to allow native plants to become established under natural conditions, to provide time for managers to monitor and refine their methods, and to provide winter wildlife habitat. Some of these restoration plots are adjacent to the Old Yellowstone Trail, an unpaved road that parallels the Yellowstone River west of Gardiner, Montana.      More Information  Invasive Plants in Yellowstone Vegetation Communities Map Vegetation References Vegetation and Resource Management Program",
