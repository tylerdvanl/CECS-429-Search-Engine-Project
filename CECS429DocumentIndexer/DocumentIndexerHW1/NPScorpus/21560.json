Local subsistence users may be fishing with set nets - give them a wide berth so they can complete their important harvest activities. Not much has been published on fishing or river conditions of this area because it is so remote. Visitors are on their own for most things, which is often why boaters come to this area. Generally, sheefish are more plentiful in the fall while grayling and pike are available year round. There should be a substantial chum salmon and a small pink salmon run in the river in the fall. Salmon spawn more in the tributaries north of the Kobuk River and sheefish and other whitefish spawn more in southern tributaries. The Pah, Black and Pick rivers are good for sheefish. Anglers are required to have a fishing license and follow Alaska state fishing regulations.",
