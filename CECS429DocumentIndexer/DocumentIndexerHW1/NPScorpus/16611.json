NPS\/D. Renkin       Mammoth Campground, elevation 6,200 ft (1,889 m), is Yellowstone's only campground that is open year-round. It is located in the northern part of the park, five miles south of Gardiner, Montana and the park's North Entrance. The road from the North Entrance to the campground winds through the steep Gardner Canyon with breathtaking views and the chance to view wildlife along the way, including bighorn sheep.  Situated in a high sage brush steppe above the Gardiner River, the campground is close to fishing, hiking, and the famous Mammoth Hot Springs Terraces. Juniper and Doug Fir are scattered throughout the campground providing shade during hot summer months. Great wildlife viewing opportunities abound with elk and bison occasionally passing through the campground or seen nearby.  RV Pull-through sites can accommodate up to 75' total length. Mammoth Campground has drinking water and flush toilets. Each campsite has a picnic table and fire pit with grate. Food storage boxes measuring 48 x 22 x 22 are available for shared use. There are no hookups. Generators may be used between the hours of 8 AM and 8 PM. This campground does not have an RV dump station.  Amenities are available at Mammoth Hot Springs and in nearby Gardiner, Montana.  Evening ranger programs are located in the amphitheater near the back loop of the campground from June through mid-September.  Sites are on a first come, first served basis. Due to having long pull-through sites Mammoth Campground is especially popular for larger RVs and trailers. Quiet in the fall, winter, and spring, this campground fills quickly in the summer.         Dates: All year   Nightly Fee: $20   Sites: 85   Elevation: 6,200 ft (1,889 m)   Accessible Sites   Flush Toilets   Generators: 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.   RV Sites: Most are pull-through                      Camping - Mammoth Hot Springs Campground   15 Photos  Mammoth Hot Springs Campground near the North Entrance in Yellowstone National Park",
