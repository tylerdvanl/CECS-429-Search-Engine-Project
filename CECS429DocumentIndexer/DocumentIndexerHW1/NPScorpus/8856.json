    "body": "Getting Around         Alger County Road H-58   After decades as a sand and gravel road then five years of construction, Alger County H-58 between Grand Marais and Munising was completely paved in 2010, creating one of the most beautiful drives in the Great Lakes region. The road has been engineered as a slow speed, scenic drive through the lakeshore, accessing such popular sites as Sable Falls, Log Slide, Hurricane River, and Twelvemile Beach.  Since the completion of the project, lakeshore staff have observed additional traffic with bicycles, tour buses, larger motorhomes and fifth-wheel trailers, and motorcycles sharing the road.  One of our top priorities is visitor safety, and we are concerned about the impact of increased traffic and speeds on H-58.  Help us make your and others vacation one to write home about. -- Watch for bicycles and pedestrians. -- Use the vehicle turnout lanes if you wish to stop and take a photo. -- Obey all no passing zones. -- Watch for motorcycles. -- Report all accidents to a park ranger, national lakeshore employee or visitor center. -- Drive at a leisurely speed, keeping in mind that the journey is important, not just the destination.  Enjoy the scenic drive at your own pace, but if you notice traffic backing up behind you please pull over to let them by to help avoid unsafe passes.",
