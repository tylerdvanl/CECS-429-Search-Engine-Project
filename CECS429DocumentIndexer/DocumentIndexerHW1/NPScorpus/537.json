This was the first historic district designated due to its association with an individual rather than an event or architectural elements. Nevertheless, the 1971 boundary excluded several significant properties. In 2011, the boundary was expanded to encompass more of the president's neighborhood and the commercial area of town. NOTE: All photographs were taken from the public right-of-way; consequently, some outbuildings are difficult to see.
