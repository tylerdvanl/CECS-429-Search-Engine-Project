A short distance up the North Country National Scenic Trail, the Marsh Trail boardwalk leads you to this interesting wetland area. Interpretive exhibits relate the rich natural and cultural heritage of the area. Old beach ridges, an active beaver colony, white cedar and black spruce swamp communities dominate the scene. The best times for this walk are early and late in the day.  A large-print trail guide is available at the trailhead.
