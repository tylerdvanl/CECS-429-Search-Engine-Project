    "body": "Centennial Initiative 2016       Centennial Vision In celebration of the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service in 2016, America invites the world to discover the meaning of national parks to their lives and inspires people to both experience and become devoted to these special places. On August 1, 2016, Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park also celebrates its Centennial anniversary. In commemoration of this event, the park is producing a series of publications on the history and culture of Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park. The subject matter of these periodicals varies from early pre-park history and the people who forged its establishment, to philanthropic associations that have had a profound positive impact on park operations, public outreach and education. Future publications will spotlight the park's museum art collection, historic preservation, archeology, and the native Hawaiian voice and perspective on Hawaiʻi Volcanoes Park, amongst other topics. We are in the process of updating this webpage, so check back soon and see what exciting plans have developed for the park's Centennial celebration! Special Centennial Publications",
