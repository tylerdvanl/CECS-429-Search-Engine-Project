    "body": "Crystal Ice Cave Tours         A visitor completes the slippery descent into the cave NPS  Crystal Ice Cave contains some of the most spectacular ice formations among Lava Beds' many caves. Because of the sensitive nature of this cave's formations and its cold environment, Crystal Ice Cave is open to park visitors only on small ranger-guided tours during the winter months. Tours of no more than six visitors (ages 12 years and older) are offered every Saturday at 1:00 pm from January through March and last 3+ hours. This is a strenuous excursion and is recommended for those in very good physical condition. Tour participants must use upper body strength to ascend a sheer, 50-foot long sloped ice floor on a rope, must be able to crawl through a tight hole, and have enough fitness and coordination to negotiate loose, boulder-strewn floors, and icy patches safely. This tour is not appropriate for people with major medical conditions such as heart disease, arthritis, or osteoporosis, or those with a fear of heights or tight places.
