Roanhorse NPS 24 June, 2015.          The Hat Shop Trail is a down and back trail that begins at Bryce Point. It is not a loop.   Walk down along the Under the Rim Trail to see a cluster of delicately balanced-rock hoodoos known as the Hat Shop.   Although listed as a \"Moderate\" hike, the Hat Shop Trail should be listed as \"Moderately Difficult\". With a steep descent, visitors with \"bad knees\" should be extra careful. The hike back to the top is considered an accomplishment in itself. During winter, the Hat Shop Trail is easily listed in the \"Very Difficult\" category and is not advised unless very well prepared.     Bring plenty of water and salted snacks (a sports drink is recommended also). Sunscreen and head gear is advised for UV protection. Insect repellent is strongly advised in summer. Foot traction devices are strongly recommended during winter.            Back to main Day Hikes page.   Back to main Moderate Hikes page.      Error: You have supplied an invalid NPMap ID.
