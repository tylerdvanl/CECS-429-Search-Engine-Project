    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Safety            Safety         Water levels on the reservoirs can change drastically throughout the year, revealing or concealing rocks just below the surface.    Wear Your PFD! Personal flotation devices save lives, and are required for children under the age of 13. PFDs are also recommended for children walking on the docks at the marinas. Please consult the Colorado Boating Regulations for required safety equipment.  Jumping Off Cliffs and Bridges Jumping off cliffs, ledges, and bridges 15 feet or more from the water surface is prohibited. Numerous people have been permanently disabled or killed from hitting rocks under the water surface.   Safety At The Overlooks Never throw anything from the overlooks into the canyon! Hikers are underneath Pioneer Point, Hermits Rest, and other areas below CO Highway 92. Even a small stone can be fatal. Please supervise children closely at overlooks as weathered and loose rock makes rim edges hazardous. Many places have no guardrails.",
