To become a Junior Ranger our young visitors must complete several activities in the Junior Ranger booklet. The booklets can be purchased from the museum gift shop at the National Park Service Visitor Center for $1.00. It generally takes about two hours or more to complete the program and gives our young visitors, and their parents, a good background into the history of Jamestown. At the successful completion of the booklet each prospective Junior Ranger will have the certificate at the end of the booklet signed and be awarded a patch designating them a Junior Ranger of Jamestown.               .",
