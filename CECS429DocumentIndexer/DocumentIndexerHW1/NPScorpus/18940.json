NPS Photo  Minidoka Relocation Center was located in Jerome County, Idaho, 15 miles east of Jerome and 15 miles north of Twin Falls. It was known locally as Hunt Camp, after the official Post Office designation for the area, since there was already a town of Minidoka in Idaho, 50 miles east. Though during its operation it was the 7th largest city in Idaho. After it was closed a large number of the buildings were removed for various uses, including housing, migrant labor camps, meeting halls or for salvage value.  The land was divided into small farms.  Forty-three of these small farms were allotted in 1947 to World War II veterans, whose names were drawn in a lottery.  In 1949 another 46 small farms were allotted.  Each veteran also received two barracks. Therefore, not much remains of the camp to help visitors understand the important story that happened there. Today there is a small gravel parking area, a 1.6 mile walking trail, and interpretative signs about this important time in out history.  The Honor Roll was reconstructed to highlight the nearly 1,000 from Minidoka who served in the war. Also, commemorated here are the Japanese Americans who died serving in the military during World War II. In 1979 Minidoka was added to National Register of Historic Places.  In 2001 it became the 385th unit of the National Park Service.",
