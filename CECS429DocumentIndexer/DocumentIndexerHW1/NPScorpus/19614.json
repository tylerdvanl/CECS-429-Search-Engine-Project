The following information will be of interest to those who desire to apply for financial assistance:  Academic scholars (including graduate students), independent scholars and professional and non-professional writers are encouraged to apply.

The applicant should state clearly the research topic and chronological period to be covered in the study. In addition, the applicant should state whether the research project is for a degree program or a manuscript being prepared for publication.

This includes an administrative history of the park from the Civil War to the present, prisoners of war during early conflicts in American history, individual prisoner of war camps and the experiences of minorities as prisoners of war. Subject matter can also extend to relevant aspects of the prisoner of war experience, such as the families of POWs and the guards at prisoner of war camps.
