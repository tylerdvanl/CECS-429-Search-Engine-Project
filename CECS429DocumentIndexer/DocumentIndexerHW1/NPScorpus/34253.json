Because of heavy traffic in this area, giving yourself extra time to get to the park, especially if you are meeting people, is highly recommended.The times of heaviest traffic in the D.C. area are from 6:30 to 9:30 a.m. and 4 to 7 p.m. on weekdays.  On weekends, it can vary.Be aware that I-66 inside the beltway is HOV-2 (high-occupancy vehicle, two or more passengers) from 6:30 to 9 a.m. going East and from 4 to 6:30 p.m. going West, Monday through Friday.  You must have two or more people in your vehicle in order to drive on I-66 during those hours. Outside the beltway, there is a restricted HOV lane.Other HOV information can be found on the Virginia Department of Transportation website.",
