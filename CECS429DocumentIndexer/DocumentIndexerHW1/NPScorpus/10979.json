The common, laid out by the Slaters in 1838, also adds to the traditional New England essence of Slatersville. Feel free to take advantage of the benches here before continuing your tour.   The Slater family built the Slatersville Congregational Church began in 1838. The Slaters were raised in the Church of England, but they built this church for their workers' needs. The church is a lovely example of the Greek Revival style topped by a three-stage belfry with an octagonal spire. Slatersville's first church, built in 1808, is now a private residence located behind the current Congregational Church.       Introduction 1 Slatersville Reservoir 2 Slatersville Library and Western Mills 3 Slatersville Mills 4 Slatersville Worker Housing 6 John Slater House 7 North Smithfield Town Hall 8 Slatersville Commercial Blocks",
