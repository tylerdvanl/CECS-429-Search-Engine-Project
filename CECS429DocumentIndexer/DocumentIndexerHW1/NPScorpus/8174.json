    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility     Service Animals              Service Animals       Service animals are allowed in national parks. For a definition of a service animal, please see the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) definition. For information on four-footed friends that do not qualify as service animals, see the Pets page. A service animal shall be under the control of its handler. A service animal shall have a harness, leash, or other tether, unless either the handler is unable because of a disability to use a harness, leash, or other tether, or the use of a harness, leash, or other tether would interfere with the service animal's safe, effective performance of work or tasks, in which case the service animal must be otherwise under the handler's control (e.g., voice control, signals, or other effective means). A permit is required to take service animals on trails, however Glacier National Park does not recommend the use of service animals in the backcountry. Having a service animal in the backcountry puts you and the animal at increased risk for wildlife confrontations. Your safety and the safety of your animal are not guaranteed. Furthermore where domestic animals and wildlife overlap there is a possibility of exchanging diseases between the two groups. Service Animals Permit Application Please remember, wildlife can be encountered anywhere in the park, even near developed and busy areas like visitor centers. Mountain lions, bears and moose are of obvious concern, but smaller animals like foxes, coyotes, and even squirrels could cause issues for service animals unused to encountering wildlife. Eagles may also be a concern for particularly small service animals who may be viewed as prey.",
