NPS  Cane River Creole National Historical Park is located in a very scenic yet rural part of Louisiana. While drivers may not encounter much traffic, there are other obstacles to be aware of. Drivers need to be cautious when navigating the roads connecting the park's Oakland Plantation and Magnolia Plantation complex due to an abundance of hair pin turns, farm equipment, and even the possibility of wandering livestock. Drivers should be especially careful during wet and icy conditions. There is no public transportation available.",
