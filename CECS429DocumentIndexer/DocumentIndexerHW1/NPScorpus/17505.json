    "title": "Channel Islands National Park: Surfing",
    "body": "Surfing          Depending on the swell direction, surfing can be done at several locations on Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel Islands. Generally, the north shore is best during the north-west swells of winter\/spring and the south shore is best during the south swells of summer\/fall. All surf spots are remote and are best accessed by private boat due to the islandsâ€™ rugged terrain and the hiking distance from the designated landing areas where the park concession vessels drop off visitors. Contact local area surf shops or the park visitor center for more information.",
