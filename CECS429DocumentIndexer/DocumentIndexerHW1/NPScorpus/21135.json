It is located near the midpoint of the Arkansas River's navigation system, which begins at its Mississippi River confluence and follows 445 miles of navigation channel through a series of 17 locks and dams to Tulsa, Oklahoma. During 1838-1839, the Bell Detachment traveled just north of the center, while other removal tribes passed through Old Post Road Park before crossing the Arkansas River.

It overlooks the Dardanelle Lock and Dam.  Exhibits: Interpretive exhibits tell the story of the development of the River Valley from the time when Native Americans were the sole occupants of this area to the present. A mural painting, artifacts, and interpretive recordings depict American Indian life in the river valley. Additional exhibits illustrate life for the early settlers along the river and the introduction of the steamboat era and its impact on the river valley. Old Post Road Park has some interpretation of historical activities during the removal era.
