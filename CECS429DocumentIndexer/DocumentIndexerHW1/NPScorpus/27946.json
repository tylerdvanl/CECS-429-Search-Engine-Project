Sustainability is a word you might be hearing a lot lately, but what does it really mean? At its core, sustainability is about making sure a system keeps going; seeing that it is supported, nourished, and survives into the future. It means living today without compromising future generations' ability to meet their needs. Sustainability has been a part of the National Park Service Mission Statement since its inception in 1916   \"...to promote and regulate the use of the...national parks...which purpose is to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations\"  Â    Our Commitment to Sustainability Obed Wild & Scenic River is committed to making its operations sustainable in order to conserve the natural wonders within its boundaries and the natural resources that extend beyond its boundaries and benefit us all. One way Obed is demonstrating leadership is by tracking and analyzing its environmental impacts. Obed is working to improve the way it uses energy, the types of products and materials it purchases, and the kinds of materials it recycles.",
