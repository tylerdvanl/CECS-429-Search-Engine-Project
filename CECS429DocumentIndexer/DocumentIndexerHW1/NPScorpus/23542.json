The agreement guides how the National Park Service and the Department of Energy will work together to preserve, protect, interpret and provide access to the historic resources associated with the Manhattan Project at locations in Oak, Ridge, Tennessee; Los Alamos, New Mexico; and the Hanford Site in Washington State.   “The creation of Manhattan Project National Historic Park is the culmination of an extraordinary partnership between the Departments of the Interior and Energy to provide public access to, and interpretation of, significant historic sites in three different states,” Secretary Jewell said. “With the creation of this park, the National Park Service is committed to telling the complete story of the Manhattan Project, including the development and use of nuclear weapons.” The 2015 National Defense Authorization Act directed the establishment of the Manhattan Project National Historical Park and required the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Energy to execute a Memorandum of Agreement for the park by December 19, 2015. The agreement reflects consultations with local communities and provides a high level framework that will guide the cooperative efforts of the National Park Service and the Department of Energy to manage the park.",
