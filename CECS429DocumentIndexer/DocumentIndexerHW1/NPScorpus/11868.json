These maps can be viewed on your mobile device with the application or viewed on any computer with Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat and printed as paper maps.A grayscale orthophoto (flown May 2014) is overlain with roads, water features, and detailed information about location, names, and ownership of public lands.  The public lands basemap is a series of 18 map tiles. Each map tile is 76 x 42\" when printed at 100%, and the scale is 1:12,000. The map projection is UTM zone 11. Datum is NAD83. To accommodate different user communities there are two versions of the map series with different reference grid system: United States National Grid, and Geographic Coordinate System. The United States National Grid (USNG) is America's national standard for search and rescue. It is based on the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid reference system, and is interoperable with the U. S. Military Grid Reference System (MRGS). Grid cells are 1 kilometer. Use this map series to be on the same page as all the emergency service personnel in the event of a disaster. Here is a user-friendly tutorial on using USNG maps.

Locations are expressed in angular coordinates of latitude and longitude. Grid cells are 1 minute.

Available with either a USNG, or a GCS grid.   USNG    GCS    A mid-size wall map at 1:72,000 scale (28 X 42\" when printed at 100%) is also available with or without a grid of USNG coordinates. This map is heavily labeled with place names.   USNG: grid   USNG: No grid     Instructions on how to install the maps on your iPhone or iPad.",
