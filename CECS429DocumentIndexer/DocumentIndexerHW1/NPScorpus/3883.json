As the primary fund-raising partner for these parks, the Trust raises money from individuals, businesses and foundations to support park programs and projects in five critical areas: • Environmental Education • Visitor Services • Resource Protection • Volunteer Activities • Community Outreach The Trust receives no government funding, relying instead on the support of private donors to fund projects that benefit park visitors and allow the National Park Service to better protect and preserve South Florida’s national parks. Since its inception the Trust has successfully funded more than 30 projects in South Florida’s national parks representing an investment of more than $2 million. By working with the National Park Service to identify and fund projects that benefit the park and its visitors, the Trust seeks to win new friends for our national parks and promote a legacy of stewardship in South Florida.
