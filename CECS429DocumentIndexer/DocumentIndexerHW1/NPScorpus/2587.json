The corporation was composed of representatives from Catholic, Jewish, and Protestant services, and was approved by the National Park Service because it offered the opportunity for all religious faiths to have a place of worship. The idea was to build a permanent building near a site on the canyon rim already used for services, including a very popular Easter Sunrise service.        Architect Harold E. Wagoner's vision for the Shrine of the Ages   Harold E. Wagoner, a member of the board of directors of the Church Architectural Guild of America, was selected as architect. Working within park service guidelines to respect the natural environment and Native American culture, he designed a structure that reflected the architectural style of a kiva, a place of worship used by Native Americans in the Southwest. This design worked well since the park service also required that no towers or specific religious symbols be used. Because the initial building site was on the rim of the canyon just west of today’s Hermits Rest Route shuttle stop, plans called for the main auditorium to have a sweeping canyon view from a multi-story, curved window placed behind the altar. A special hydraulic lift would raise and lower at least three different altar configurations for Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant services. An organ placed on a small balcony, with wind chests and pipes located at different sections of the main chapel, would provide stereophonic sound effects.        Proposed placement of the Shrine on the rim of the canyon   Even as fund-raising efforts reached around the world, questions about whether the rim was an appropriate location for the structure resulted in delays. Some even argued that the building only remotely resembled a kiva, instead looking more like a huge spacecraft perched on the canyon rim. Donations were never quite enough to realize Wagoner’s plans, so federal funding became involved. The building was ultimately redesigned and relocated away from the edge of the canyon. An appropriate site was chosen next to the existing Grand Canyon Pioneer Cemetery, and the Shrine of the Ages was completed by 1970.        Main entrance into today's Shrine of the Ages   The National Park Service took over ownership of the building in 1975, along with all maintenance, operational and administrative duties. Today various organizations use the building, as can anyone who qualifies for a Special Use Permit. The Shrine of the Ages sees many activities, including the annual Grand Canyon Music Festival, Celebrate Wildlife Day, and Hiker’s Symposium. The National Park Service uses the building for office space, training, special events, and ranger programs, including the daily Evening Program from October through April. And of course, the building continues to be used for some religious services.              Grand Canyon Pioneer Cemetery NPS  Grand Canyon Pioneer Cemetery Looking for famous historical figures involved in the development and protection of Grand Canyon?
