On this page, you'll find a brief statement of a proposed transmission line project, a short background, and links to documents that provide explanation and analysis. The project: Dominion Virginia Power, a private utility company, is proposing to build an overhead electric transmission line across the James River within Virginia's \"Historic Triangle.\" The proposed line would cross directly through one of our nation's most iconic historic landscapes, crossing over the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail and within the viewshed of Historic Jamestowne, Colonial National Historical Park, Carter's Grove Plantation National Historic Landmark and many other nationally significant historic properties. The proposed line would cause irreversible damage to this important landscape that has been preserved for the past 400 years, severely marring the visitor experience and historic integrity of the area. Background: Dominion Virginia Power decided to close two coal-fired plants in Yorktown, VA which deliver electric power to the Hampton Roads peninsula. Among the many alternatives for delivering electric energy, Dominion selected a plan which would place 17 transmission towers up to 295 feet in height in the James River and applied for a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In its consideration of the permit, the Army Corps must adhere to several federal laws such as the National Historic Preservation Act and the National Environmental Policy Act. The Army Corps is nearing the end of a multi-year process of meeting its obligations under federal law as it considers the permit application. The Army Corps can: deny the permit due to its impacts on federally recognized resources;grant the permit after an assessment determines there are no significant impacts to the human environment including natural, cultural, and historic resources;or delay a decision pending further evaluation through an Environmental Impact Statement.   The National Park Service is strongly opposed to the transmission line and its path as proposed by Dominion. NPS Director Jonathan B. Jarvis stated: \"The proposed overhead line would mar the historic setting that represents the very beginnings of and the military defense of our nationâ€¦. It would set a precedent for additional development and cumulative effects. It would forever degrade, damage and destroy the historic setting of these iconic resources. This is not acceptable for resources designated by Congress to ensure their permanent protection.\" The National Park Service is urging the Army  Corps of Engineers to deny the permit for the proposed overhead line and to encourage Dominion Virginia Power to further examine the many other solutions available that do not impair this nation's natural, cultural, and historic resources.
