This gallery showcases some of the special Centennial events at Ellis Island leading up to and during 2016.          Silent Voices   36 Photos  Here are photographs of the south side of Ellis Island which consists of the hospital complex built to treat immigrants. For the medical staff of the U.S. Public Health Service, Ellis Island was considered a prime assignment, with the opportunity to treat and learn about many exotic diseases they would not normally see. The hospitals on Ellis Island stand as a testament to the ordeals some immigrants had to endure, as well as to the compassion and care they encountered at the hands of the doctors and nurses here.          Hearing Room   4 Photos  This Hearing Room has been restored to its appearance from 1908 to 1910.

Ellis Island Collection Photographs   5 Photos  Items in Ellis Island's museum collection          Historic Photographs   12 Photos  Historic Photographs of the Immigration Station on Ellis Island in the early 1900s          Immigrant Photographs by Augustus Sherman   24 Photos  These historic photographs of immigrants being processed at Ellis Island. The photographs were taken by Augustus Frederick Sherman who worked as a clerk on Ellis Island from 1892 to 1925. He took about 250 interesting photographs of immigrants between 1905 and 1925. Augustus Sherman was fascinated by where the immigrants were coming from and their traditional clothing. He usually photographed immigrants that were detained briefly and used mostly dull backgrounds so the immigrants themselves were the main focus. These were not official documentation photographs, merely Sherman’s record of the variety of cultures that passed through Ellis Island.            Hurricane Sandy Destruction   11 Photos  On October 29, 2012, Ellis Island was completely submerged by the storm surge from Hurricane Sandy. Basements flooded, which caused extensive damage to several systems: electrical, water, sewage, telephone, heating, air conditioning and data. Many supply items in storage were destroyed. Temporary structures and machinery were moved and\/or destroyed. These photos show some of the damage.          Creating Connections: Great Hall Bench 2012   13 Photos  In a very unique collaboration, students in schools in western New York designed and built replicas of the historic benches in the Registry Room on Ellis Island.  Bench 2012 was completed by students of Prattsburgh Central School District, New York. For many of the students from this small rural community, it was the first time they traveled to NYC.
