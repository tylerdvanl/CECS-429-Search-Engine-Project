NPS Photo       The mountain's landscape undergoes a dramatic transformation in winter. Its colorful subalpine meadows and lush old growth forests are draped with a thick blanket of snow for much of the year. The sometimes dusty appearing glaciers are freshly covered in white and the snow-covered roofs of the rustic historic buildings are rimmed with icicles, creating a picture perfect setting.         The historic Administrative Building, part of the National Historic Landmark District at Longmire. NPS Photo  Winter Recreation Ever wonder how Mount Rainier's plants and animals spend the challenging winter months and cope with heavy snows and chilling winds? How do they survive the long winter to reproduce, gather food and store energy in the mountain's short snow-free season? Learn about Mount Rainier's winter ecology by taking a snowshoe walk with a ranger and viewing the Jackson Visitor Center exhibits and film. Warm up in the visitor center while enjoying the snowy view from the great hall, having lunch, or browsing in the gift shop. The snow play area is open for sledding when enough snow is on the ground to protect vegetation at Paradise. Other activities at Paradise include crosscounty skiing, winter camping, and snowboarding. Winter Travel Most of Mount Rainier's roads are closed for winter. The road from Nisqually Entrance to Longmire is open year-round, but may close during extreme weather. The road between Longmire and Paradise closes nightly in winter and reopens in the morning once the road has been plowed. Icy or snowy roads, poor visibility due to weather, and the chance of wildlife along roads can make winter travel challenging.

Reduce your risk by following these simple guidelines: Dress Warmly & Stay Dry Cold temperatures, wet snow, and wind can easily rob you of body heat. To avoid hypothermia and frostbite, dress warmly and stay dry. Wear layers of wool or synthetics like pile and polypropylene under a waterproof shell. Avoid exposure to wind. Snack frequently, drink lots of water, and take warm-up breaks indoors. Pay Attention to the Weather It's easy to get lost or fall when the weather turns bad. The trail can quickly cover with snow, or thick fog can blanket your route. You need to know where you are and how to get to safety. You also need to know how to assess avalanche hazards to minimize potential risk. Prepare When hiking, climbing, skiing, or snowboarding bring the Winter 10 Essentials listed on the Winter Safety page and know how to use them. In addition, obtain compass bearings to Camp Muir or other off-trail destinations; carry an altimeter; wear rain- and wind-resistant clothing; and take a whistle, a \"space blanket\", and a snow shovel.   Take Care Tell someone your travel plans so they can notify the park if you fail to return. Do not travel alone or in poor visibility.  If you are not truly knowledgeable and prepared, or if the weather is questionable, don't push your luck!         Gray Jays are sometimes called Camp-robbers because of their habit of begging for food around campsites. Jays are well-adapted to cold and are a common sight around Mount Rainier during the winter. NPS Photo  Winter Wildlife The snows of winter concentrate wildlife where life is easier- where shallow snow provides easier travel and access to food. Parking areas and roadways are efficient travel corridors for deer and foxes, and deer may find the most available forage along roadways. Many visitors feed wildlife to get a better photograph and some mistakenly think that it helps the animals through the winter months. But this brings wildlife closer to vehicles and people, often with dire consequences. Animals attracted to these busy areas are often injured or killed by vehicles. The feeding of wildlife, an especially significant problem at Paradise, poses a threat to wildlife by increasing the risk of disease transmission (among themselves and to you), unnaturally increasing populations which may prey on other species (jays feed on eggs and nestlings of other songbirds), and causing digestive problems (their systems are adapted for natural foods, not cheese crackers). Please keep your food away from wildlife. Pick up food particles and don't leave your lunch on your bumper- a fox or jay will find it. And lastly, please don't feed the wildlife- it's bad for them, and it's bad for you- feeding wildlife is illegal and you may be fined. Learn more about how to Keep Wildlife Wild.",
