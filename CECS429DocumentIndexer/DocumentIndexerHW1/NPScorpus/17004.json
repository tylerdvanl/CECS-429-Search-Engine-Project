WILDERNESS PERMITS AND RESERVATIONS Wilderness permits are required for all overnight stays in the backcountry. Permits may available on a first-come first-served basis, or through an online reservation system.  Although we encourage backpackers to acquire their wilderness permits from the Inyo National Forest, the staff at Devils Postpile can issue first come, first served permits for trips originating out of trailheads within Reds Meadow Valley. These walk-in permits are free of charge. Permits can be issued for the day of entry or the day before (starting at 11:00am). Reservations are not available through the Devils Postpile Ranger Station. Backcountry users interested in obtaining a reservation must use the online reservation system.  Approved bear resistant food storage containers are required for all destinations in the Ansel Adams or John Muir Wildernesses as well as for Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon National Parks. Devils Postpile has a limited number of these available for rent for $5.00\/week (7 nights), and $2\/night after one week. If you need multiple bear cans, please rent them at the Mammoth Lakes Welcome Center in the town of Mammoth Lakes prior to entering the Reds Meadow Valley.
