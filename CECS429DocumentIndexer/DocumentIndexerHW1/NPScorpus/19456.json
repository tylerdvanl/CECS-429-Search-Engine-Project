Backcountry Horseman Association photo  Approximately 200 species of birds use the Buffalo National River for at least some part of the year. Nearly half of those species live here year round and can be seen frequently during canoe trips down the river. Great Blue Herons, Belted Kingfishers, and Wood ducks are a common sight in almost any section of the river, and Bald Eagles are observed frequently during the winter, as they rest in trees on the ridge tops that overlook the river. Nearly 100 of the recorded species migrate to the oak-hickory forest that surround the river to build nests, lay eggs, and raise their young here during the summer. The unbroken tracts of forest attract other migrators to feed and rest during their spring and fall migrations between breeding grounds of northern U.S. and Canada and wintering grounds in Central and South America. Many of the birds found within the canopy of the forest are more likely to be heard than seen. The challenge of identifying these cryptic birds by only their song or call can be a rewarding experience and one easily found within the dense woods of Buffalo National River. Bird Checklist",
