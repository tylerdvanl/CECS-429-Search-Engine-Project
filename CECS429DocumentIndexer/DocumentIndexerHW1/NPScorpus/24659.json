    "body": "Bus Tours       Narrated Tour Buses  Unlike shuttle buses, which are not narrated, tour buses feature a trained naturalist who both drives the bus and narrates during the trip.  Tour bus trips begin and end at various locations around the entrance of the park - they do not pick up at campgrounds along the Park Road, and they are not set up for passengers to disembark and re-board. Shuttle buses are a better option for passengers who want to get off the bus to hike, picnic, etc.  There are a few different bus tours from which to choose. All tours are conducted by certified driver-naturalists who will provide a guided, informative trip into the park. Tour buses are tan-colored, to help them stand out from a distance. Descriptions of each tour are below.   Reservations and Prices Reservations for bus trips are made through our bus concessionaire, Doyon\/Aramark Joint Venture. You can buy bus tickets online or call 1-800-622-7275. The National Park Service does not operate any of these tours (though a ranger will join participants on each Kantishna Experience Bus for part of the day). Questions concerning departure times, ticket refunds, etc., should be directed to Doyon\/Aramark Joint Venture through their website or the phone number previously listed. Tour bus ticket prices vary year-to-year, and vary depending on the length of your tour.         Looking out past Savage River toward Primrose Ridge (middle \/ right of image). The Natural History Tour turns around at Primrose Ridge, Mile 17 on the Denali Park Road. NPS Photo \/ Nathan Kostegian  Denali Natural History Tour (DNHT) Offered mid-May - mid-September  Focusing on the rich natural and cultural history of the park, this 4 ½ to 5 hour tour travels to Primrose Ridge (Mile 17). Several interpretive stops enhance the experience, beginning with a stop at the Wilderness Access Center for a viewing of the film \"Across Time and Tundra\" which depicts early visitor experiences within the same area traveled by DNHT passengers.   A stop at the still-used ranger cabin - called Savage Cabin - provides a living-history glimpse of the folks who might have used the cabin at one time. At the Primrose Ridge turnaround point, you will experience a memorable Alaskan Native presentation that will enlighten you regarding how this land has been used for nearly 10,000 years. A snack and hot beverages are provided. Wheelchair accessible buses are available, and all stops are wheelchair accessible.      Tundra Wilderness Tour (TWT)  Offered: May 20 - mid-September Duration: 7 to 8 hours (round-trip, inclusive of all stops)  Variations of this tour have been in existence since 1923, with the first concessioner offering bus trips as far as the road extended at that time. Today, the TWT is a 7-8 hour excursion into the park with a certified driver-naturalist. Going to at least Toklat River (mile 53), this tour provides in-depth information about the history of the park, while maintaining a keen eye in search of wildlife and photography opportunities. A box lunch and beverages are provided. Wheelchair accessible buses are available, and all stops are wheelchair accessible.  In spring and fall, a shortened version of this tour, called the Teklanika Tundra Wilderness Tour, travels 30 miles into the park to the Teklanika River rest stop. This option is only available when the full-length Tundra Wilderness Tour is not running. Up to 30 or 40 Tundra Wilderness Tours travel into the park each day; most departures are early morning or early afternoon.         Kantishna Experience  Offered June 8 - mid-September  Follow the trail of pioneer Fannie Quigley to the old gold town of Kantishna on this all-day adventure to the end of the Park Road. Your driver is a Certified Interpretive Guide and a National Park Service interpretive ranger joins you roughly halfway through your journey on this immersive experience. You will spend time in Kantishna learning about its interesting history and role in Interior Alaska.  This trip lasts 11 to 12 hours, traveling the entire 92 mile road and back over the course of the day.  The Kantishna Experience includes a lunch, snack and beverages. There are two daily departures. The tours pick up from area hotels in the early morning and depart from the Wilderness Access Center at 6:30 am and 7:30 am. They return roughly twelve hours later, and are a unique experience in the park that you don't want to miss! Specific hotel pick-up times are available from the bus company.  Some walking is involved.      Views from the Denali Park Road    Check out an assortment of views from the road in Denali. Note: Points are approximate, these images are not placed at precise locations. There are plenty of other great views from the road, too - this is just a smattering of good spots!",
