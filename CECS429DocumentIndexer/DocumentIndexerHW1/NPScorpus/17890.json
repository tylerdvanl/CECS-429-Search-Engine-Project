Value the places that reflect your community's history? You should know about Section 106 review, an important tool you can use to influence federal decisions regarding hisorit properties. By law, you have a voice when a project involving federal action, approval, or funding may affect properties that qualify for the National Register of Historic Places, the nation's official list of historic properties. This guide from the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), the agency charged with historic preservation leadership within federal government, explains how your voice can be heard. What is Section 106 review? In the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), Congress established a comprehensive program to preserve the historical and cultural foundations of the national as a living part of community life. Section 106 of the NHPA is cruicial to that program because it requires consideration of historic preservation in the multitude of projects with federal involvement that take place across the national every day. Section 106 requires federal agencies to consider the effects of projects they carry out, approve, or fund on historic properties. Additionally, federal agencies must provide the ACHP an opportunity to comment on such project prior to the agency's decision on them. Section 106 review encourages, but does not mandate, preservation. Sometimes there is no way for a needed project to proceed without harming historic properties. Section 106 review does ensure that preservation values are factored into federal agency planning and decisions. Because of Section 106, federal agencies must assume responsibility for the consequences of the projects they carry out, approve, or fund on historic properties and be publicly accountable for their decisions.
