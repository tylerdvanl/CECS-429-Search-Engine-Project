    "body": "Plant Communities       The different plant communities that make up the Point Reyes peninsula are as varied as the different neighborhoods one would expect to find in a bustling city. As you travel around the Seashore, you pass from luxuriant forests of Douglas-fir and bishop pine, into windswept coastal grasslands. You hike through coastal scrub, enjoying the multitude of shrubs with their different smells and textures, to arrive at a salt marsh bordering an estuary. Or perhaps you take a stroll out amongst the coastal dunes to look for rare wildflowers on a spring day. These communities are dynamic. One melds into the next, change sweeps through in dramatic and subtle ways so that what you experience during one visit may be quite different when you return. The next generation of visitors, many years from now, may hike the same trail and experience a mature forest where you walked among newly sprouted trees invading a meadow. All of these dynamic plant communities combine to form a wonderfully diverse tapestry of plant life at Point Reyes National Seashore. Enjoy your exploration! Vegetation Map Top of Page",
