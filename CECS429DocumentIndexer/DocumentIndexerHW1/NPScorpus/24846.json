    "body": "Hunting       Sport hunting and trapping are permitted in Alagnak Wild River. To hunt and trap, you must have all required licenses and permits and follow all other state regulations. The National Park Service and the State of Alaska cooperatively manage the wildlife resources of the wild river. An Alaska State hunting license is required for all hunters age 16 or older. Bag and possession limits vary by species and by area. Always check current hunting regulations. For further information on Alaska hunting and where to get a license, visit the Alaska Department of Fish and Game website. Please keep in mind that many areas within the wild river are private land. Do not enter private land without the landowner's permission. The most common species hunted include moose and brown bear. There are many factors applicable to season dates as well as residency requirements for species such as caribou. Regulations specific to Alagnak Wild River can be found under Game Management Unit (GMU)-9. Hunting and trapping within Alagnak Wild River requires extensive planning. Access in most cases will involve air taxi service via float plane from King Salmon or one of the other surrounding villages. We highly recommend you to contact any of the several permitted commercial operators who provide taxi and hunt transport services throughout the local area. A list of these providers can be found here: Directory of Commercial Visitor Services. Take the time to understand land ownership prior to hunting as there are some private land parcels within the wild river boundary. We also recommend sharing your camp and hunt plans with the Park office as part of your trip safety plan.",
