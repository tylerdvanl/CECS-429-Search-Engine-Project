A Junior Ranger is an explorer. A Junior Ranger is a learner, and this type of learning is informal and fun. A Junior Ranger is a protector of the national parks. Junior Rangers discover things they can do to help make sure there are always parks to visit in the future. They learn things they can do in the parks, and things they can do when they return home. When they have completed their activity booklets, children are sworn in as a Junior Ranger and receive a badge, patch, and certificate. Each year 450,000 children become Junior Rangers.  The Junior Ranger program is designed for visitors between the ages of 5 and 12. You can pick up an activity book at the visitor center. There are multiple activities to choose from, with subjects ranging from Coronado's Expedition to the cave, a nature walk, visitor center displays and more. After completing the activities, you will receive a Junior Ranger badge and certificate (the Coronado Jr Ranger patch shown in the photo is currently unavailable). Are you unable to travel to the park but still want to be a Junior Ranger? Visit the Webranger page to learn how to become a Junior Ranger from home!
