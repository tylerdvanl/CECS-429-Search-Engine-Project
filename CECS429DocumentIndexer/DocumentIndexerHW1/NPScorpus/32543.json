Within its boundaries exists pristine mangrove habitat, located in a portion of Hurricane Hole and offshore coral reefs and algal plains.  The mangrove habitat in Hurricane Holes provides protective and ecologically important habitat for many terrestrial and marine organisms, as well as, refuge for registered boaters during hurricane season.  A trip into hurricane hole provides visitors with a unique mangrove snorkeling experience where coral, juvenile fish and various marine invertebrates may be found.  Hurricane Hole also provides a peaceful soundscape.  Visitors can listen to shore bird calls and the wind as it blows through the landscape.
