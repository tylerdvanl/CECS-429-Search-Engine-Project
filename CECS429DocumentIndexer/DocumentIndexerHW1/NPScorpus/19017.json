    "body": "Traffic & Travel Tips       Interstate Highway I-55 runs to the heart of Springfield, as does Interstate Highway I-72.  Amtrak is very reliable to travel to and from Springfield as is Greyhound bus lines. You can take the Amtrack train from Chicago or St. Louis to Springfield; however, if you plan to go to Lincoln's Tomb, War Memorials, Route 66 sites, or New Salem State Historic Site, you need a car, as these sites are not in easy walking distance from downtown Springfield. Parking downtown is available on the street, meter parking on weekdays, and there is access to several parking garages. Be mindful of one-way traffic flow on certain downtown streets and of railroad crossings and bus stops.  Â     Downtown Springfield NPS Photo",
