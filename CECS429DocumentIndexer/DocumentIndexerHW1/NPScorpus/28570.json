At present time, not much is known about Thomas Clark and more research is still pending. However, it is known that Thomas Clark was probably an attorney in Pittsburgh. Furthermore, on Monday, April 26, 1897, the Allegheny County borough of North Braddock was established by Judge Kennedy of the Quarter Sessions Court of Allegheny County. The first elections of the new borough were held on May 18, 1897, and a Thomas Clark was elected a councilman. It is unsure, at this time, if this is the same Thomas Clark who was a member of the Club.",
