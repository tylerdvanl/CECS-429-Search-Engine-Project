Big Thicket National Preserve accepts donations by check, made payable to \"Big Thicket National Preserve\" and sent to Administrative Officer, Big Thicket National Preserve, 6044 FM 420, Kountze, TX, 77625. The full amount of the check will be used to support the preserve; no administrative fees are charged.  A portion of the proceeds from our bookstore sales goes to support our interpretive programs and projects. The bookstore sells a wide variety of educational, recreational, and souvenir items. Call (409) 951-6722 for more information or to place an order by phone.
