    "body": "Wilderness Law and Policy       Wilderness Law In the United States, designation of federal land as \"Wilderness\" can only be done by the Congress. It is the highest degree of legal protection that exists for federal land, and is an \"overlay\" on top of its status as a national park or other federal property. Here are links to the law which established the Federal Wilderness Preservation System, and guides the management of all federal wilderness areas, and the specific legislation which designated the Gaylord Nelson Wilderness at the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. Congress late changed the name twice, eventually arriving at the \"Gaylord Nelson Wilderness,\" in keeping with the Nelson family's wishes and to put the name more in line with other wilderness areas around the country.  1964 Wilderness Act (external link) 2004 Gaylord A.
