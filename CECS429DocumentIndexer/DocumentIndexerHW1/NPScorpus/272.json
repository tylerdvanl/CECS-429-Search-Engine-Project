For many Chimney Rock was a highlight of the trip west. For those passing this way before 1851, Robiduox Pass was a  time consuming detour away from the North Platte River and for those emigrants traveling the trail from 1864-1867 the site of Fort Mitchell was a welcome reminder of the protection provided by frontier forts along the road.",
