Since 1997, over $60 million of entrance and camping fees has been spent on various improvements and projects in Rocky. The projects completed in 2013 include the following:  Sewer upgrades to piping in Moraine Park Campground Comfort station remodels at Aspenglen Campground Historic rock walls rehabilitated on Trail Ridge Road Trails rehabilitated on Flattop Mountain, Finch Lake, Lawn Lake and North Inlet Park roadways striped and road shoulders stabilized Constructed accessible campsites in Aspenglen Campground Solid waste collection improved to reduce visitor and bear confrontations Mitigate hazard trees alond the road corridors for visitor safety       October 1st, 2015 Fee Increase On October 1, 2015, Rocky Mountain National Park increased entrance fees to fund important maintenance and improvement projects. Because of Rocky's proximity to the populated Colorado Front Range, the park added a single day pass option. This \"Day Use Pass\" is $20 while the weekly pass is $30. The annual park pass increased to $50 and will increase to $60 by 2017. Campground fees increased to $18 a night for winter rates and $26 a night for summer rates.",
