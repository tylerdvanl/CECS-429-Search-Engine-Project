Photo by Sally King  Alamo Boundary Trail is a relatively easy hike from FS 289 to the boundary between the monument and the Valles Caldera National Preserve. The trail is only 1.3 miles each way but it also connects with the Coyote Call Trail on the Valles Caldera. Elevation change on the Alamo Boundary Trail is only 400'. This a trail is a great place for solitude.  Â     Alamo Boundary Trail is also a good place to see wildlife that lives at higher elevations. Photo by Sally King",
