Only a few species of reptiles have been documented at Saint-Gaudens. Included are Snapping, Painted, and Wood Turtles, and Milk, Ringneck, and Common Garter Snakes.   Occasionally sighted along the trails and near the pond are Painted and Snapping Turtles; while Common Garter Snakes can be seen along the trails, in the hedges, or hiding among the tall grasses in the field. The presence of additional species is likely, as the park is within the native range of more reptiles, particularly snakes.",
