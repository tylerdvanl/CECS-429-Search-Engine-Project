Weather, climatic shifts, and geologic processes continue to shape this environment as they have for millennia. More recently, human-caused factors such as air, noise, and water pollution, as well as introduced species, have had a much greater impact on natural resources world-wide. The undeveloped landscapes of Montezuma Castle and Montezuma Well provide an ideal place to study how various environmental factors affect desert ecosystems, and predict what changes might be expected in the future.",
