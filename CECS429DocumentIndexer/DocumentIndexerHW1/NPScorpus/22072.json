Travelling between each of the park's four visitor services areas takes time and, in some cases, prior planning and logistics. To ensure your visit is a successful one, use the travel times listed in the below chart when planning your trip. These times do not include time for stops- if you plan on viewing the scenery, taking pictures, and enjoying activities (all highly recommended), then traveling between these areas will take longer than what is listed.
