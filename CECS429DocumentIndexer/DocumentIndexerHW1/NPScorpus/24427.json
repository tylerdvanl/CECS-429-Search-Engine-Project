Guidebooks are available for a small fee at either visitor center, or at a self-service post near the monument's entrance station. Features along the route include petroglyph and pictograph panels, Josie Bassett's cabin built in 1913, and fantastic views of geologic layers. A short spur road takes you to the Split Mountain Boat Launch where you can see the Green River leaving Split Mountain Canyon or watch river rafters arriving after a several day journey through the monument. Wildlife may occasionally be seen, including mule deer, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, prairie dogs, and many bird species. The last two miles of the route are unpaved but well maintained. The last four miles are unplowed in the winter and may not be passable by car December to March. Fuel, food, and other services are not available along this route. The nearest services are in Jensen, Utah, seven miles south of the Quarry Visitor Center.       Map of the Quarry Visitor Center and Cub Creek Area",
