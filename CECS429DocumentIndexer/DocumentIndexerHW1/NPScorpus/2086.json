NPS Photo \/ Chip Littlefield  Nature in a Historical Park? Yes! Tumacácori National Monument (now National Historical Park) was established in 1908 to protect, preserve, and tell the story of the old Spanish and O'odham mission ruins.  In 2005, more than 300 acres were added to the park, reuniting the church grounds with a small piece of historical mission property, and placing more than a mile of Santa Cruz River riparian environment, mesquite bosque (forest), and a section of the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historical Trail (\"Anza Trail\") within the park. The park's many environments, both natural and cultivated, make its small area proportionally diverse. You can hike the Santa Cruz along the Anza Trail, explore the mission grounds and visitor center, and experience the rich array of plant and animal life that made Tumacácori a thriving community for generations.
