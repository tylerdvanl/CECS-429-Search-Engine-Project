Clara Barton supplied the necessities of survival - food, clothing and shelter, but also provided tools for cleaning-up and rebuilding. Her principle was be prepared before the disaster occurred. Clara Barton stated: \"Before us now lie the problems of the future, and the question is: How shall we meet them? As friends of humanity, while there is still a possibility of war or calamity, it behooves us to prepare... the world-wide motto of the Red Cross:   In time of peace and prosperity, prepare for war and calamity.\" Clara Barton taught us that we should be prepared before something bad happens. You can help your family do this. Be a leader, develop emergency kits and emergency plans for your family. The Department of Homeland Security has a fun website to help you learn more. Play games and learn how your family can be prepared before a disaster strikes.  Visit their web site at: http:\/\/www.ready.gov\/kids",
