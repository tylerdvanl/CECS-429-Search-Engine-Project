Heavily decorated with cave formations, wide-open spaces, and relatively flat, it is a must-see. The 1.25 mile trail winds around showing off areas like the Hall of Giants, Bottomless Pit, and Crystal Spring Dome. Photos can never fully capture the grandeur of the Big Room, it's a place you need to see to believe!          Natural Entrance Trail   6 Photos  Explore the transition from light to dark as you descend into the cave on the self-guided Natural Entrance Trail. This 1.25 mile trail showcases the route early explorers would have taken to reach the Big Room of Carlsbad Caverns.          Ranger-guided Tours   16 Photos  Crawling through tight passageways, shimmying down chimneys, walking among massive cave formations, holding onto a rope as you descend into a cave...there is something for everyone to experience on ranger-guided cave tours.            Lechuguilla Cave   20 Photos  Lechuguilla Cave is one of the finest known caves on the planet. Cavers and scientists flock to Carlsbad Caverns National Park to survey and study this beautiful underground wilderness.
