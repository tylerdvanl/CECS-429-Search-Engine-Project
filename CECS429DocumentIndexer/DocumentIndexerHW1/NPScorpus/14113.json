Be sure to clean up after your pet especially in the campground. Do not leave animals unattended in vehicles or campers. Always pick up any pet food after your pet has eaten to prevent bears and other wildlife from visiting you at your campsite.  If you plan to go out on the river with your pet make sure that you and your pet both have personal flotation devices.  Restrain your pet from drinking in the river or streams.  Remember that streams may contain bacteria or parasites such as Giardia which can be harmful to your pet. Carry water with you for your dog.  During hunting season, a dog that is with a licensed hunter and actively following game does not have to be leashed. However, when entering a designated Safety Zone hunting dogs must be restrained on a leash, crated or caged.  Service animals are permitted in visitor centers as long as they are on a leash or being carried.  Know that some trails have steep ladders and rock ledges. Some pets may not be able to negotiate these areas without your help.  Check with park rangers for trail information.  Before coming to the park make sure your pet is up to date on all vaccinations including rabies.  Pets should have identification and rabies tags on their collars.  Make sure you check for ticks on you and your pet after visiting the park.",
