What better way to learn about the world than by exploring Ebey's Landing National Historic Reserve?   Here's four things you can do with your fourth graders at Ebey's Landing. For more information about the Every Kid in a Park program go to www.everykidinapark.gov.  1. Take a Walk!  There are several family friendly walks throughout Ebey's Landing National Historical Reserve. One of the most popular is the 0.8 mile  Bluff Trail from the Prairie Overlook to the Bluff Overlook. Along the way, pass working farm fields, ocean views, and the historic Jacob and Sarah Ebey House.   2. See What's Growing!  Throughout the year you can see crops as they grow, mature, and are harvested. Ebey's Landing was founded by farmers to protect the rural landscape you still see today, and the fields you see throughout the reserve are privately owned family farms. Check out local farmer's markets for chances to sample local products, and remember to always respect working fields by viewing them from roads and overlooks.    3. Step Into the Past!  You can explore the Admiralty Head Lighthouse used to guide ships through the Juan de Fuca straight, explore a World War II era military bunker at Fort Ebey, and walk to the end the historic wharf in downtown Coupeville. The past is alive and visible throughout Ebey's Landing.     4. Discover Wildlife!  Wildlife abounds throughout the Reserve. You can watch for Orca whales in Penn cove, spot birds of all kinds on Crockett Lake, and see Harbor Seals floating off shore along the Ebey's Landing beach trails.",
