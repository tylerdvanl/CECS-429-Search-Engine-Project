Always allow extra time on busy, holiday weekends, such as Memorial Day, Labor Day and Columbus Day weekends. Following the suggested directions, approximate travel times from various locations are:Downtown Miami — 60-90 minutesFort Lauderdale\/Hollywood — 75-105 minutesHomestead — 20 minutesKey Largo — 40 minutesYou should allow additional time during peak commuting times (7-10 a.m. and 4-7 p.m.) Morning southbound traffic will ease considerably after you pass downtown Miami.Traveling on US Highway 1 can be a long, slow and arduous journey from the north — Florida's Turnpike is the suggested route to avoid delays.",
