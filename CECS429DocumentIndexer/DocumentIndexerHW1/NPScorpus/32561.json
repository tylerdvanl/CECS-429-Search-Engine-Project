    "body": "Sustainability and the Apostles       Overview The National Park Service is responsible for the stewardship of natural and cultural resources and management of visitor amenities and park infrastructure. Apostle Islands National Lakeshore (park) has made significant strides in fostering sustainable practices and promoting innovative solutions to this challenge. In 2005, National Geographic Traveler Magazine named the park our nation's most sustainable national park. In 2005 and 2006, the governments of four of the park's gateway communities (the cities of Ashland, Washburn, and Bayfield and the town of Bayfield) each passed resolutions committing themselves to the goal of sustainability and following The Natural Step - a sustainability framework adopted by communities and organizations around the world.  Currently, environmental management and sustainability initiatives are conducted within the framework of the park's Integrated Environmental Plan (IEP), which fulfills the requirements of the NPS Environmental Management System (EMS) model and the Office of Management and Budget EMS Scorecard. The IEP is an adaptive management system guided by the park's visions and goals for the future. It is fueled by the legal reporting requirements and voluntary sustainability initiatives of the park and managed by staff in clearly defined roles and responsibilities. It proactively addresses park sustainability, providing a long-term decision-making framework.  The Apostle Islands National Lakeshore Sustainability Commitment strives for \"maximum sensitivity and protection for the park's (and the planet's) natural and cultural resources, doing so in a way that is economically sensible and considers the short and the long term impacts of our decisions\".  The following list outlines some recent actions to park policies, operations, and every day practices that represent the park's commitment to sustainability:  Energy Use  Photovoltaic energy systems installed on off-grid housing on the islands and ovens replaced with small stovetop burners to reduce use of propane and promote sustainable seasonal employee living. Replaced lighting in Park Service buildings with LED, energy-efficient products. Enacted park-wide Power Management of Electronic Equipment policy to promote more efficient energy use by park staff while at work.   Transportation  Increased fleet efficiency through the purchase of more efficient vehicle and boat vessels. Created vehicle and boat vessel scorecards that provide reminders for more efficient handling and allow users to select the most appropriate vehicle and vessel choice for particular trips.   Education and Outreach   Specialty training opportunities for staff offered on topics related to climate change and sustainability. Integration of climate change topics and sustainability into interpretive and educational programs. Update of current climate change displays at Stockton Island in summer of 2011. Climate change intern hired during summer 2011 to provide interpretive programs at the park's partner location, Northern Great Lakes Visitor Center in Ashland, WI.
