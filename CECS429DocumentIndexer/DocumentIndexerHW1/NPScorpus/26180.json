    "body": "Explore This Park    Get Involved     Planning             Planning       Park planning helps define which types of resource conditions, visitor experiences, and management actions will best achieve the mandate to preserve resources unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations. Units of the national park system use planning to bring logic, analysis, public involvement, and accountability into the decision-making process. At Fort Vancouver NHS, park planning and decision-making is conducted as a continuous, dynamic cycle, from broad visions shared with the public to individual, annual work assignments and evaluations.
