Within the CFR Superintendents are given the authority to amend, modify, relax or make more stringent certain regulations. These park specific regulations are incorporated into a document called the Superintendent's Compendium and are an extension of the CFR. These publications help direct the park's management efforts to best serve the mission of the National Park Service and the needs of visitors.
