    "body": "Birds       Although small in size, (less than 10,000 acres), Chickasaw National Recreation Area plays host to a remarkable number of birds. The eastwest ecotone where the hardwood forests meet the grasslands, the overlap of north and south, and the proximity to the central flyway provide more types of birds than are found in some larger areas. Over 160 of the birds on this list have actually been sighted in the area. The rest are probably here at one time or another during the year but either haven't been sighted yet or the sightings haven't been reported. If you see something interesting, let us know. We appreciate your sighting reports.       Abundance a - Abundant: likely to be seen in large numbers in proper season and habitat c - Common: frequently seen in small numbers in proper season and habitat u - Uncommon: may be seen regularly in small numbers in proper season and habitat o - Occasional: seen irregularly in small numbers, even in proper habitat r - Rare: present irregularly in a portion of its habitat, seldom seen Seasonal Occurrence SR - Summer resident PR - Permanent resident WV - Winter visitor M - Migrant Habitat This listing is for habitat where bird is most commonly found. If no habitat is listed, the bird is of widespread occurrence. W - Water areas: lakes, ponds, streams, marshes F - Forest: riparian and upland woods B - Brush: forest edge, thickets, fencerows P - Prairie: grasslands, pastures, cultivated fields R - Riparian: deciduous vegetation along streams             GEESE & DUCKS                          OCCURRENCE          HABITAT ___ Tundra swan                           rWV                 W ___ White-fronted
