    "body": "Explore This Park    Get Involved     Support Your Park             Support Your Park       Several ways exist in which to support Virgin Islands National Park. One may do so by joining the Friends of Virgin Islands National Park, volunteering, making a donation or simply just browsing the Eastern National (the Park's Cooperating Association) bookstore located in the Visitor Center and purchasing an item. All support Virgin Islands National Park in different ways. You can make a gift to benefit our park either directly or through our primary non profit organization. If you make the gift directly to the park, the entire gift will be used for the purpose you identify. Your check will be deposited in a government account and the full amount will be spent as you intended. Government accounts are non-interest bearing and cannot generate interest between the time it is deposited and the time it is spent. For security and other reasons, you cannot make on line contributions directly to the park or National Park Service, however, you can stop in or mail a check to the park's visitor center to donate.  You can make on line gifts through our primary park partner, Friends of Virgin Islands National Park on their website. Donations can be directed to the general need of the park, or to a specific program or project (i.e. trail maintenance or education program).  If you are looking for a fun way to support your park, sign up for The Friends Paddle the Park Race, or the Annual \"Beach To Beach Swim\". Of course the Friends Gala is always to enjoy yourself while supporting your favorite park!.",
