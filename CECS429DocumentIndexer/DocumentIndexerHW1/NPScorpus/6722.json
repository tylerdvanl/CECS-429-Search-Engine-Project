In West Virginia, one can hike a portion of the Appalachian Trail on Loudoun Heights to overlook the historic town. From Jefferson Rock, visitors can observe the confluence of the Potomac and ShenandoahRivers. This view of the water gap in the Blue Ridge Mountains was described by Thomas Jefferson as being \"one of the most stupendous scenes in nature.\" Within the lower town of Harpers Ferry, visitors can cross the Potomac River footbridge into Maryland, follow the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal NHP for a short distance, and then take a trail up to the MarylandHeights overlook.
