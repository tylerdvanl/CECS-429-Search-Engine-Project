There are 16 stops along a dirt road and it takes approximately two hours to make the round trip. An interpretive brochure for the Geology Tour Road that highlights each stop is available online and at the beginning of the road. In good weather, most passenger vehicles may access the first few miles of the Geology Tour Road. Watch for the sign marking the point beyond which a 4-wheel-drive vehicle is recommended, and turn around there if your vehicle is not capable of handling deep ruts and soft sand. The road is not suitable for campers, trailers, and motor homes.",
