    "body": "Explore This Park    Get Involved     Sustainability             Sustainability       Support and direction for environmental stewardship at Big Cypress is embedded in both the National Park Service mission and the national preserve's significance. Recent executive orders and acts require the federal government to protect resources through sustainable operations and facility adaptation. Big Cypress has been working toward becoming a greener park for many years. Early efforts in sustainability included operating alternatively fueled vehicles, and replacing toxic solvents. The preserve's continued commitment to sustainability is made more urgent due to a changing climate and increasing impacts to natural resources, both locally and globally. The complexity of Big Cypress creates challenges and requires collaboration among managers, and assistance from partners. From using safer and greener cleaning supplies to purchasing paper that is 30 percent recycled content, Big Cypress National Preserve is looking greener every day.  Â        Climate Friendly Parks Program homepage.   Plans are currently in the works to become a certified Climate Friendly Park. Through certification, stronger strategies will be developed to mitigate more greenhouse gas emissions as well as an education plan to give visitors science based information about climate change.",
