    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility             Accessibility       No trails or public facilities exist inside the boundaries of Alagnak Wild River. Wild Rivers are those rivers or sections of rivers that are free of impoundments and generally inaccessible except by trail, with watersheds or shorelines essentially primitive and waters unpolluted. These represent vestiges of primitive America. Extra obstacles will be encountered in the backcountry because of the remote, wild nature of this special place. Licensed commercial operators may be able to provide some accessible services. If you have questions concerning accessibility, please contact us.",
