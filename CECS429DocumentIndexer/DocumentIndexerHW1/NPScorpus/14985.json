The YCC is a summer employment program for young men and women, ages 15-18, who work and learn together by participating in conservation work on public lands. The program is expected to begin on June 13, 2016 and run for 8 weeks. YCC applicants must be in very good physical condition. This work can be fun, even adventurous, but it can also be strenuous and is performed in hot, rugged, dirty environments. Planned work projects include exotic weed control, trail maintenance, native plant care, landscape restoration, and walkway and cave restoration. At the same time, YCC learn about the outdoors, first aid, wildlife, caving safety, and a variety of other subjects. It is fun, enriching, character-building hard work!
