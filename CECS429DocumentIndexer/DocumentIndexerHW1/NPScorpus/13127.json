    "body": "Military Groups       Antietam National Battlefield is one of the best-preserved Civil War battlefields in the country. A nine mile tour road allows for a self-guided tour of the battlefield. The park brochure provides an elementary overview of the battle, and there are several hundred War Department markers along the tour road that provide more detailed descriptions of the action during the battle. In addition, there is other helpful information on our web site.  Staff rides to America's battlefields are a 100 year old tradition. In fact, the five original battlefield parks - Chickamauga, Antietam, Gettysburg, Shiloh and Vicksburg were created by the War Department in the 1890s just for that purpose. A park ranger may be available to give you a guided tour or staff ride of Antietam. Contact Park Ranger and Army War College graduate Keith Snyder at 301-432-5124 or send him an e-mail to discuss your visit. Military groups who visit the park as part of their professional military education can qualify for a waiver of the entrance fee.
