If so, there are a few things to keep in mind:                   In general, pets are allowed in New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park boundary area, but the park visitor center does not allow pets inside the building unless it is a service animal. Pets are allowed in the garden area but must be restrained either on a leash not exceeding 6 feet in length (leashed pets may not be left unattended), caged or crated at all times. Human companions are responsible for cleaning up and depositing pet waste in trash receptacles. For information on service animals at the park click here.
