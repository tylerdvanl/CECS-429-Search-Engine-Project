After the lecture, a panel of Minnesota water experts joined Cox in a Q & A session with the audience covering a wide range of water quality issues. The lecture and panel discussion are available online in video, PDF and audio formats at http:\/\/www.freshwater.org\/index.php\/component\/content\/article\/424-cox-lectures-on-farm-runoff-.  Land Stewardship Project's Farm Beginnings Program  Farm Beginnings is a farmer-led educational training and support program designed to help beginning and transitional farmers who want to evaluate and plan their farm enterprise. Participants engage in a mentorship experience and network with a variety of successful, innovative farmers; attend practical, high quality seminars, field days and conferences; and receive resource materials. They also create links with experienced farmers through farm partnerships, land and equipment use and\/or rental. The program allows participants to see sustainable farming practices being used on real farms under a variety of conditions. For more information, visit http:\/\/www.landstewardshipproject.org\/farmbeg.html.  USDA launches loan program for land preservation, conservation The USDA Farm Service Agency has launched a program that will provide credit to farm owners to implement land preservation techniques that will conserve natural resources. The conservation loan program will offer direct loans for up to $300,000 and guaranteed loans for up to $1,119,000. The funds can be used to install conservation structures, improve permanent pastures, or adapt other emerging or existing conservation practices, techniques, or technologies. This program can also be used to implement strategies to assist Minnesota livestock producers in meeting the open lot runoff reduction requirements. More information is available from the Farm Loan Manager at your local Farm Service Agency office; visit http:\/\/offices.sc.egov.usda.gov\/locator\/app?state=mn&agency=fsa.  Nutrient Best Management Practice (BMP) Challenge Best Management Practices (BMPs) for fertilizer use are designed to save farmers money and maintain optimal crop yields. The BMP Challenge program works to give farmers growing corn for grain or silage an opportunity to test reduced nutrient and tillage rates on their fields, without worrying about loss to their income. Essentially, the Nutrient BMP challenge pays farmers cash if their yield and income are reduced by adopting the nutrient BMPs. It is available to corn farmers in Minnesota as well as a number of other states, for up to 160 acres per farm. There is also a Reduced Tillage BMP challenge that Minnesota farmers are eligible for, which encourages use of no-till, ridge-till, stip-till, and other options. Program information is available at http:\/\/www.bmpchallenge.org\/.   MN Department of Agriculture's Water Quality Assurance Program Minnesota livestock producers have a new voluntary and proactive way to address water quality issues on their land through the Livestock Environmental Quality Assurance Program (LEQA). With funds from the environmentally-dedicated sales tax, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) has launched the program to help livestock producers take the initiative on a non-regulatory basis to evaluate water quality issues and implement appropriate practices.   MDA has contracted with Ag Resource Strategies, LLC, to recruit farmers to enroll in the LEQA program. The company trains technicians to look at the farm in separate resource management areas, such as the farmstead, livestock facilities, fields and wooded areas. The technicians then develop an assessment and an action plan, if necessary. The assessment and plan is confidential unless the farmer decides otherwise.   The cost to register for the program is $225. The farmer then receives an assessment, action plan and up to 20 additional hours of assistance from the LEQA technician. More information is available at www.agresourcestrategies.com or contact Tim Gieseke at 507-359-1889.

Study: Porous Pavement Looks Promising for Improving Water Quality Shingle Creek was the first stream in Minnesota to be designated as containing unacceptable levels of chloride, most of which comes from road salt for de-icing. A MPCA study estimates that the chloride load to the Creek needs to decrease by 71 percent - a daunting goal to accomplish while still keeping public safety in mind. Using porous pavement to reduce chloride in surface waters looks like a promising approach.   In September 2009, the City of Robbinsdale built a traditional asphalt street surface at the intersection of 41st and Zenith streets in Robbinsdale as a control section. The city also built a porous asphalt street surface at 41st and Abbott streets as a test section. One complete winter of study found that the porous section generally maintained a warmer profile than the control section. When melting conditions occurred, water seeped through the porous section instead of re-freezing at the road surface. It is anticipated that this reduced build-up of ice will decrease the need to apply road salt in the first place.  The study will continue over the winter of 2010-2011, with an additional paired intersection in Robbinsdale. The section constructed in 2009 was on a sand subgrade, and the section to be constructed in 2010 will be on a clay subgrade. Additional details available at http:\/\/www.shinglecreek.org\/pages\/PermeablePavement\/.

The system incorporates an experimental wetland-based treatment and reuse facility that captures rainwater and reuses it several times before returning it to the soil as clean water. The system, which serves as an alternative to standard septic and sand mound on-lot sewage systems, is scalable and can be used in sustainable landscapes for residential and small commercial entities. This project will help promote the adoption of wetlands-based residential and institutional wastewater treatment systems to help encourage homeowners and businesses to seek out more sustainable and water-efficient wastewater treatment options.  For additional information, visit the Rodale Institute website at: http:\/\/www.rodaleinstitute.org\/wpec\/home. EPA Launches New Strategy to Promote Use of Green Infrastructure for Environmental and Economic Benefits The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is launching a new strategy to promote the use of green infrastructure by cities and towns to reduce stormwater runoff that pollutes the nation's streams, creeks, rivers, lakes and coastal waters. Green infrastructure decreases pollution to local waterways by treating rain where it falls and keeping polluted stormwater from entering sewer systems. In addition to protecting Americans' health by decreasing water pollution, green infrastructure provides many community benefits including increased economic activity and neighborhood revitalization, job creation, energy savings and increased recreational and green space. Effective green infrastructure tools and techniques include green roofs, permeable materials, alternative designs for streets and buildings, trees, rain gardens and rain harvesting systems.  EPA will work with partners including local governments, watershed groups, tribes and others in ten cities that have utilized green infrastructure and have plans for additional projects. EPA will encourage and support expanded use of green infrastructure in these cities and highlight them as models for other municipalities around the country. The ten cities are: Austin, TX; Boston, MA; Cleveland, OH; Denver, CO; Jacksonville, FL; Kansas City, MO; Los Angeles, CA; Puyallup, WA; Syracuse, NY; and Washington, D.C. and neighboring Anacostia Watershed communities.

EPA Releases Risk Analysis Tools for Drinking Water and Wastewater Utilities The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is releasing two software tools for risk assessment and consequence analysis: - The Vulnerability Self Assessment Tool (VSAT), an upgraded all hazards risk assessment tool - The Water Health and Economic Analysis Tool (WHEAT), a newly developed consequence analysis tool  The release of VSAT and WHEAT will provide drinking water, wastewater, and combined utilities of all sizes with the capability to assess, plan for, and better respond to man-made threats and natural disasters.  VSAT is an interactive desktop software tool that enables users to perform customized risk assessments. The tool not only evaluates man-made threats but also users to assess four different natural disaster scenarios: hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes. VSAT has the flexibility for the user to assess other types of natural disasters as well.  WHEAT is an intuitive desktop software tool that assists drinking water utility owners and operators in quantifying public health impacts, utility financial costs, and regional economic impacts of an accidental or adverse event. Currently, WHEAT generates consequence results based on two scenarios for drinking water utilities: 1) release of a hazardous gas and 2) loss of operating assets. There are future plans to develop similar wastewater utility modules.  Among the programs' other benefits, users can easily import consequence results from WHEAT into VSAT to better refine consequence assessments that support overall risk assessments; and users can use VSAT to develop utility-specific risk analysis summaries and reports, and create an emergency response plan.  The VSAT and WHEAT tools are available for download free of charge through EPA's website at: http:\/\/water.epa.gov\/infrastructure\/watersecurity\/techtools\/index.cfm   Online manual for stormwater treatment practices The University of Minnesota's St. Anthony Falls Laboratory has released a new online manual to help users assess the performance of, and schedule maintenance for, stormwater treatment practices. Stormwater Treatment: Assessment and Maintenance builds on the knowledge and experience of engineers, researchers, faculty, consultants, watershed districts and many others. It provides guidance and recommendations for measuring performance and maintaining stormwater treatment practices. The manual is available at http:\/\/stormwaterbook.safl.umn.edu\/.   Policy to Reality: Model Ordinances for Sustainable Development Updated Originally published in 2000, the model ordinances found in From Policy to Reality: Model Ordinances for Sustainable Development have been recently updated. These newer ordinances offer legal tools to help local governments steer changes in their communities to reflect the aspirations of their comprehensive and other plans. Chapters include, among others, \"Natural Resources Performance Standards\" and \"Stormwater and Erosion and Sediment Control Ordinance.\" Produced by CR Planning in partnership with DeSotelle Consulting, EOR, the MN Pollution Control Agency, and others. The model ordinances are available at http:\/\/www.crplanning.com\/susdo.htm.   US Environmental Protection Agency Water Quality Scorecard The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in recognition of the challenges facing communities trying to balance water quality protection with accommodating growth, recently released a Water Quality Scorecard. The tool helps local governments identify opportunities to remove barriers and create codes, ordinances, and incentives for better water quality protection. It guides municipal staff through a review of relevant local codes and ordinances-across multiple departments and at the municipality, neighborhood, and site scales-to ensure that these codes work together to protect water quality goals.

Free Webinar: Designing Low Impact Development (LID) to Work: Lessons Learned from North Carolina  This webcast features a discussion of barriers to LID implementation and the progress that is being made to address them from a \"boots on the ground\" perspective of the North Carolina State Cooperative Extension, as well as a landscape architect who is making LID a reality. Participants are encouraged to register and download presentations prior to the webcast at Watershed Academy Webcast Seminars at http:\/\/water.epa.gov\/learn\/training\/wacademy\/webcasts_index.cfm.  Webinar: Better Site Design Gets Better The Center for Watershed Protection first introduced the concept of Better Site Design (BSD) in 1998, as articulated in 22 model development principles. Since that time, the Center has used BSD in its work with many communities, reviewing local codes and policies and conducting development codes roundtables. The objective of BSD is to improve local development codes (zoning, subdivision, stormwater, etc.) so that development and redevelopment projects can reduce impervious cover and runoff. This webcast starts with a discussion of development strategies at the watershed scale, then focuses at the site scale with an overview of the BSD principles, provides tools for communities to use to change codes (the codes and ordinances worksheet and EPA water quality scorecard), and presents case studies of communities that have used BSD to make local code changes. Whether you are a seasoned Development Roundtable veteran, or new to BSD, this webcast will introduce you to a \"better\" way to do Better Site Design. http:\/\/www.cwp.org\/our-work\/training\/webcasts.html.  Free Webinar: A Sustainable Water Future for Minnesota-How to Get There  Dr. Deborah Swackhamer spoke at the University of Minnesota's Water Resources Science Seminar Series on November 19, 2010. She presented the Minnesota Water Sustainability Framework, which is a 25-year plan for how to reach sustainable management of the state's water resources. It addresses water quantity and quality, surface water and groundwater interactions, and both human and ecological uses for water. The Framework identifies the key issues, strategies to address these issues, and specific recommendations for how to implement the strategies - all with the purpose of achieving sustainable water resources for now and the future. This project was commissioned and funded by the Minnesota Legislature. The presentation is available at https:\/\/umconnect.umn.edu\/p80615032.  Free Webinar: Evidence-Based Restoration: Promoting Successful Restoration through Effective Monitoring and Adaptive Management Restoring the Chesapeake Bay's natural processes and functions in order to produce widely enjoyed benefits (e.g., recreational fishing and swimming) requires a multi-faceted approach, including using the strongest science possible to maximize the effectiveness of restoration actions. Some key take-home points of a recent literature review were: 1. Restored sites are marked by high variability and therefore early measurements can provide misleading indications of both positive and negative outcomes; 2. Some integrative metrics can be difficult to use in adaptive management since they can fail to pinpoint stressors; and 3. For stream restoration, restoring structure does not necessarily restore function.  Overall, it appears that many metrics in widespread use are not providing useful information about key functional outcomes and that fewer, more meaningful, metrics may be preferred to many inexpensive metrics.  Finally, initial site selection and project goal setting must be realistic with respect to site constraints. The best restoration design and implementation cannot overcome high levels of system stress; therefore, screening sites for compatibility with restoration goals is probably the most important component of promoting successful restoration.

Free Webinar: Effects of Riparian Buffers on Nitrate Concentrations in Watershed Discharges: New Models and Management Implications  Watershed analyses of nutrient removal in riparian buffers have been limited by the geographic methods used to map buffers and by the statistical models used to test and quantify buffer effects on stream nutrient levels. We combined geographic methods that account for buffer prevalence along flow paths connecting croplands to streams with improved statistical models to test for buffer effects on stream nitrate concentrations from 321 tributary watersheds to the Chesapeake Bay, USA. We developed statistical models that predict stream nitrate concentration from watershed land cover and physiographic province.  Model predictions for the study watersheds provided estimates of nitrate removals achieved with the existing cropland and buffer distributions. Compared to expected nitrate concentrations if buffers were removed, current buffers reduced average nitrate concentrations by 0.73 mg N\/l (50% of their inputs from cropland) in the Coastal Plain study watersheds, 0.40 mg N\/l (11%) in the Piedmont, and 0.08 mg N\/l (5%) in the Appalachian Mountains. Restoration to close all buffer gaps downhill from croplands would further reduce nitrate concentrations by 0.66 mg N\/l, 0.83 mg N\/l, and 0.51 mg N\/l, respectively, in the Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and Appalachian Mountain study watersheds. Aggregate nitrate removal by riparian buffers was less than suggested by many studies of field-to-stream transects, but buffer nitrate removal is significant and restoration could achieve substantial additional removal.

Free Webinar: Clean Water Act's Section 401 Water Quality Certification Policy The Clean Water Act's \"Section 401\" water quality certification policy is a powerful but under-utilized tool that allows states to review and then veto or place conditions on activities requiring a federal license\/permit that may result in a discharge of pollution. The 401 certification process is a rare chance to fundamentally change the way in which an activity is conducted (e.g., requiring buffers, revegetation, time restrictions on activity during spawning, etc.) or to stop it altogether when the activity will violate water quality standards. The free webinar is available at www.rivernetwork.org\/resource-library\/401-certification-webinar.   Free Webinar: Where has all the Nitrogen Gone? Hot Spots in the Land and Seascape We have done a great job at figuring out where all the nitrogen (N) comes from, but we are a little weak on where it goes. Is it going away or will it result in longer term problems? There has been a seven-fold increase in N since John Smith's arrival to the Chesapeake Bay Area-50% increase during first 360 years and 50% increase in last 40 years. There are quite a few hotspots in the land and sea-scape for nitrogen sources, but also areas that remove nitrogen. Population in the basin is going up, but the area of impervious surfaces has increased even more. Historically the Chesapeake region had significantly greater wetlands area, promoted in part by beaver activity. This has resulted in significant reductions in the rates of denitrification. The bay has nutrient obesity - too much of a good thing. Restoration goals should include fostering wetland areas.
