The most common snakes at Fort Pulaski are the yellow rat snake, black rat snake, corn snake and Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnake, of which only the Eastern Diamondback is poisonous. Rat snakes may surface at times inside Fort Pulaski itself. The Diamondback Terrapin, a small turtle, might be seen around Cockspur Island. Occasionally alligators may be seen basking in and around the fort moat. The tidal waters surrounding Fort Pulaski contain the usual variety of fish typical of southern coastal estuaries.",
