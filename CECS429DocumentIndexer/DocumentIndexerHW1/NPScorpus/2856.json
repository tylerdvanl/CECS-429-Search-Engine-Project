The best time to shoot is in early morning or early evening when the shadows and contrasts are more pronounced. The winter skies, spring flowers, summer recreation and fall clarity make for year-round photographic opportunities. Remember to always lock up your equipment out of sight in your vehicle. In the summertime, cars and trunks can get too hot for equipment to be stored for very long.      Still Photography & Film Permits Lake Mead NRA requires permits for professional photography and filming. Please visit our Film and Photography Permit page for more information. (Personal photography does not require a permit)",
