    "body": "Weather Data - Yellowtail Dam Area         The area beyond Yellowtail Dam gets enough precipitation for mixed grasslands to thrive. NPS  The Yellowtail Dam sits at the mouth of Bighorn Canyon, approximately a mile from Fort Smith, Montana. The precipitation around this area is 15 â€“ 18 inches a year.  Rain here is more likely to be significant in May and June. Just downriver from the dam begin the rolling grasslands which stretch across the horizon for miles on end. This landscape is more tolerant of summer grazing and growing wheat because of the rainfall pattern.
