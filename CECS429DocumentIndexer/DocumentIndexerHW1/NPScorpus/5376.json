Its slopes are textured by what the Chiricahua Apache called \"standing up rocks\" -the result of powerful volcanic events combined with geologic erosive forces over time. Hundreds of these rhyolitic rock formations occur in the monument-surprising and delighting visitors while inspiring respect for the powerful forces of nature.  It is these geologic features that have earned Chiricahua a designation among our nation's most treasured places. Through the hard-fought efforts of some of its earliest ranching families, the area was made a National Monument in 1924. It is the stories of these families as well as those of Chiricahua as a cultural homeland to the Chiricahua Apache, a loved homestead, a CCC work site, and a guest ranch-that visitors to this remote oasis can relate to on a human scale.",
