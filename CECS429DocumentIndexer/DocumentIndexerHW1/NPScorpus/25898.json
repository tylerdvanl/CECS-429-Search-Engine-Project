He was given the cave’s location by Charlie Crary, believed to be the first person to actually descend into the cave. In this early party were Hebert, Jesse Girelle, his wife, the two Cole girls, and Mayme Sprague.        Exploring the Cave NPS Photo  “I started down…” I was supposed to lead, Herbert said. We had to jump down a hole that I could just about squeeze through, six or seven feet. I started down with my lantern. Had to crawl on hands and knees facing a terrible wind for about fifty feet, and then the main hole seemed to be going down at right angles and very steep, but it gave a good foothold.        Cabin on right located over Natural Entrance. Building on left constructed in 1890 at site of present entrance.

Those on top helped to pull us up. They went down as far as where the main part turned down, but got scared and went back.      Previous Page Next Page       Devil's Lookout NPS Photo Archive",
