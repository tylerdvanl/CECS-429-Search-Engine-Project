Known by the Cherokee as \"the river of many cliffs,\" Linville Gorge was the nation's first officially designated wilderness area. Towering hemlocks, dense stands of rhododendron, and native wildflowers grow along the trails that begin at the visitor center and encircle the falls. Perhaps more than anywhere, visitors here understand that waterways and streams have played a vital role in the overall ecology and unsurpassed beauty of our region. Picnicking and camping are available. Avoid weekends for a less crowded experience.          Linville Falls as seen from the trail outlook NPS Photo, Angelina Stancampiano",
