    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility     Physical \/ Mobility              Physical \/ Mobility       Frederick Law Olmsted NHS has three major features to explore. Home: The 1810 farmhouse that was the family home is now our exhibit space and is fully accessible to those people with mobility issues. Historic Design Office: Connected to the Olmsted's home is a rambling multi-level design office. Two sets of steep staircases are used to get through the office wing as well as other smaller staircases. This area is not accessible for people who use a wheelchair. In 2015 a new video tour was filmed and has a ranger to guide you through the rooms giving the same information one would get on a tour. This is available on request. Grounds: The grounds are uneven, but many people have toured portions of them using a wheelchair. Some areas, like the sunken garden called the \"Hollow\" are not accessible, though one can see the whole area from above looking down from the adjoining Carriage Turn. A ramp on the Carriage Turn can allow access to the South Lawn, but one should use their own judgment on traversing it using a wheelchair.",
