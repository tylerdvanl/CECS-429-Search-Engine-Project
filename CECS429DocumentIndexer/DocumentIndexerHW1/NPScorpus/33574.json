To reduce water usage, many park facilities are equipped with low-flow or waterless fixtures. At Fort Harrison park housing and the maintenance facility, they have rain barrels to capture water for gardening and washing vehicles and equipment. In addition to reducing water usage the park also works to protect the water quality in our streams. Fifteen miles of park streams drain into the Chesapeake Bay, and 99% are protected by thick forested buffers to help protect water quality and the plants and animals that call the streams home. The maintenance facility's parking lot has an oil-water separator to prevent harmful pollutants from entering nearby waterways.         Learn more about the Chesapeake Bay.",
