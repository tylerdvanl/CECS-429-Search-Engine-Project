    "body": "Trails Forever Program       Trails Forever is a partnership program between Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the Friends of the Smokies. The Friends have donated $500,000 to support the program, in part through the generosity of the Knoxville based Aslan Foundation. The Trails Forever program provides the opportunity for a highly skilled trail crew to focus reconstruction efforts on high use and high priority trails in the park. The program also provides a mechanism for volunteers to work alongside the trail crew on these complex trail projects to assist in making lasting improvements to preserve the trails for future generations.  This year, the Trails Forever crew will be working on the next phase of the Alum Cave Trail restoration.   View the Frequently Asked Question page for more information about the Alum Cave trail closure in place during this restoration project.
