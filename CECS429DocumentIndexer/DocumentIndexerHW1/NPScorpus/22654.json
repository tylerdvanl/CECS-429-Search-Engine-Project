NPS       Encounters With Wildlife Please view all wildlife from a distance. Never disrupt, approach, or attempt to feed any wildlife. Make noise (talking or clapping) while hiking to avoid surprising wildlife. Keep your backpack within arms reach at all times. It is unlikely that you will see a black bear and even less likely a mountain lion. But it's a good idea to know how you should behave if you do:  • Give bears or lions a way to escape. Most animals will try to avoid confrontation. • Give bears or lions with young extra space. • If you have a child with you, either pick them up or hold onto them. • Make eye contact with a lion, but don't with a bear. • Stay calm and speak firmly to the animal.  • If the bear or lion doesn't run away, back away slowly and leave the area. Don't turn your back or run.       Overlook EtiquetteThere may be hikers or rock climbers below any overlook. Never throw anything from the rim into the canyon! Even a small stone can be fatal.Supervise children closely. Weathered rock makes rim edges hazardous, and many places have no guardrails. Keep dogs on leash.Take It Easy At AltitudeThe canyon rim is 8,000 feet above sea level. Take precautions, drink plenty of water, and slow down.",
