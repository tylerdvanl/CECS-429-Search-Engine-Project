    "title": "Chaco Culture National Historical Park: Benign Neglect",
    "body": "Benign Neglect       This is a phrase used to describe the type of preservation treatment that is used at the vast majority of sites in Chaco. Each structure is thoroughly documented, a careful condition assessment is made, monitoring and evaluations are done on a routine cycle, but no hands-on preservation treatment is performed. Many of the sites in this category of preservation treatment are relatively stable and do not need to be interfered with, so benign neglect is appropriate.",
