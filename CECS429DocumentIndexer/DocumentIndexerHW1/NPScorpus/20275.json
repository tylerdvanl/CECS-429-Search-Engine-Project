NATIONAL PARK SERVICE  \"My life on the farm during the Great Depression more nearly resembled farm life of fully 2,000 years ago than farm life today. I have reflected on it often since that time; social eras change at their own curious pace, depending on geography and technology and a host of other factors. It is incredible with what speed those changes have totally transformed both the farming methods and a life-style I knew in my boyhood.\" Jimmy Carter, 1975  Â    Cell Phone Tour Stops A narrated cell phone audio tour is available that allows visitors to explore the Jimmy Carter National Historic Site either during operational hours or after the park has closed. There are several tour stops that include the Boyhood Farm, the Depot and the Plains High School. The Boyhood Farm has several stops of its own and all stops can be accessed by dialing the number listed on the tour stop signs and entering the stop number. There may be a charge for roaming depending on your wireless carrier.   While listening to the audio, you can access several functions to aid in the enjoyment of the program and audios:  Press \"1\" to rewind. Press \"2\" to pause, and play again.
