The story of Apache Pass and the events that led to the establishment of Fort Bowie are told on a 3-mile roundtrip hike from the trailhead on Apache Pass Road to the visitor center and Second Fort Ruins. Considered by most to be a \"moderate\" hike, the just under 200 foot elevation gain, uneven terrain and semi-arid desert environment can prove to be a tad too much for some park visitors. To use this alternative access, follow the car directions, but look for the ADA accessible icon signs from Apache Pass Road. Passenger vehicles can travel Old Fort Bowie Road until it dead-ends in a small administrative area at Fort Bowie NHS. From the ADA parking lot, visitors follow a trail that is 500 feet in length and ascends approximately 80 feet in elevation to reach the visitor center at the edge of the second fort ruins. If unable to climb the steps, visitors can arrange to have a gate opened that allows them todrive a vehicle to the visitor center and unload wheelchair users or other folks with limited mobility. Because this method traverses fragile parkresources, it is reserved as a limited option for those folks that are unable to visit the fort ruins without it. Contact the visitor center staff at 520-847-2500, ext. 1, for more information on accessing Fort Bowie NHS. Please note parking is not available in the administrative area for buses, RVs, or trailers.",
