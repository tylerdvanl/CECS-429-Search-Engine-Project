The rock formations delight kids as well as adults, and many short hiking trails provide opportunities for everyone to get out of the car and explore the park's features. Kids may also enjoy the ranger-led programs offered spring through fall. Stop at the visitor center to check current schedules, and take some time to view the exhibits and the park's orientation video. It is also good to find out how to help care for the park before heading out on any trails. The Junior Ranger Program is a great way for kids to learn about the park while having fun during their visit. Free booklets and Red Rock Explorer backpacks are available at the visitor center. For kids at home, the Park Fun page helps kids learn about the park before their visit. The Student Guide is also a great resource for park information, especially for school projects.",
