I have no doubt but this tract of country if cultivated would produce in great abundance every article essentially necessary to the comfort and subsistence of civillized man. to it’s present inhabitants nature seems to have dealt with a liberal hand, for she has distributed a great variety of esculent plants over the face of the country which furnish them a plentifull store of provision…”        Yellow starthistle is an invasive weed that threatens species diversity and ecosystem health at Nez Perce National Historical Park sites. NPS Photo  Since Lewis and Clark’s time,  most of the habitat for plants important to the Nez Perce culture, have  been drastically altered through agricultural and industrial development. This makes it especially important to preserve remaining habitats and monitor current conditions in Nez Perce National Historical Park. Within the park, management issues include concerns over the spread of nonnative and invasive weeds—e.g., yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis), field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis), poison hemlock (Conium maculatum), and others—and the preservation and interpretation of wildlife habitat in the face of  increasing commercialization and urbanization. The presence of any federally listed threatened or endangered species require managers to consider potential actions to avoid impacts on special status species and\/or wetlands that support such species. Climate change is also an increasingly pressing issue throughout the National Park Service and the nation.",
