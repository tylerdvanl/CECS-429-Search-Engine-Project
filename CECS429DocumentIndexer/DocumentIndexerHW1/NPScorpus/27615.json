Some participants may have to park along the tour road and walk to the cemetery. Parking in the cemetery will be reserved for participants with accessibility needs. Please display your placard so the ranger at the gate can see it as you approach. No drop-offs will be permitted at the national cemetery entrance. All groups will register as they enter the national cemetery. Groups will receive flags and a section assignment during registration. Volunteer groups may pre-register for a commemorative patch through the Middle Tennessee Council Boy Scouts of America.
