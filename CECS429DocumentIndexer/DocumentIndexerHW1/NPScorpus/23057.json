Visitor Centers       White Sands Visitor Center The visitor center was built in 1936 and is part of the historic district at White Sands. Inside you will find the park store as well as the museum for the monument                 NPS Photo  Welcome to White Sands! Essential Information for Your Trip The weather in the Tularosa Basin is usually quite nice with clear, sunny skies for approximately 330 days out of the year. Summers are hot with daytime temperatures averaging 97ºF (36ºC) in the summer and 60ºF (16ºC) in the winter. Most of our rainfall occurs during \"monsoon season\" from early-July through mid-October. Due to our unique geology and the high water table beneath the dunes, the monument sometimes floods during monsoon season, which may make it necessary to close part of Dunes Drive (the 16-mile round-trip road through the monument).    Monument operating hours vary by season. Occasionally there may be monument closures in affect. Visitors are encouraged to call the visitor center at (575) 479-6124 ext. 236 or 206 to verify that a closure is not in effect.    Entrance fees are currently $5 per adult (16 years of age and older). Children ages 15 and under are free. The National Park Service has also designated various days through out the year as Fee Free Days. Those interested in interagency park passes can purchase them at the entrance station.    Reservations are not needed to enter the monument but some of our ranger programs do require advance reservations. Special rates are available for those bringing commercial bus tours to the park. School groups coming to the monument for a curriculum-based activity are eligible for an educational fee waiver.    The nearest restaurants and gas stations to the monument are located in the town of Alamogordo, 13 miles northeast of the monument on Highway 70.  For those who prefer not to make the drive into town, White Sands Trading Company gift shop offers a wide variety of snacks, sandwiches, and drinks, as well as an array of souvenirs. The park store managed by Western National Parks Association also offers a wide selection of educational souvenirs, including puppets, DVDs, and books.    Visitors are also welcome to bring their pets to the monument as long as they are kept on a leash. Animals are not permitted in the visitor center or gift shop, with the exception of service animals. Do not leave pets unattended or locked in your vehicle.    Applications for various Special Use Permits are available, including weddings, backcountry camping, and commercial filming and photography.   An alcohol ban is in effect from February 1 through May 31 of every year. This rule is strictly enforced by law enforcement. Other park regulations are in effect year round and also strictly enforced.",
