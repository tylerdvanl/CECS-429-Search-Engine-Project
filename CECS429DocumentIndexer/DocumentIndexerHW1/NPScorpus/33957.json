    "body": "Virtual Tour Stop, East Face of Salient        After the Union break through on the morning of May 12, the Confederates counterattacked on both sides of the Muleshoe Salient. While much attention has been focused on the intense fighting at the Bloody Angle on the west face of the salient, heavy fighting occurred along the east face. Gordon's division moved forward across the Harrison and McCoull farms to eventually recapture the works.         Although hard to capture in a photograph, much of the complex earthworks in this area survive.          Heth's Salient, tour stop #7 on the driving tour of the battlefield.
