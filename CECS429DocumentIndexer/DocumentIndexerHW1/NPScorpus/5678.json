    "body": "Commercial Visitor Services       The National Park Service must determine what types of commercial activities are necessary and appropriate at Big Cypress National Preserve. All commercial activities must operate in a manner that is consistent with the mission of the  Preserve and the National Park Service. That is to say, all commercial activities operating within the Preserve should provide high quality visitor experiences while protecting important natural, cultural, and scenic resources. The 1991 General Management Plan and other planning documents identified the Preserve mission or purpose to provide and protect, in perpetuity, the natural, scenic, hydrologic, and recreational values and cultural resources. Operating any type of commercial visitor service within Big Cypress National Preserve without written authorization from the United States is a violation of Title 36, Code of Federal Regulations. It is a citable offense. If you are in doubt, please contact the Big Cypress National Preserve either by mail, telephone, or in person.
