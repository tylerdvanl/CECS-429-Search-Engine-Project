This mission honors the legendary work of Superintendent Bates Wilson, who came to Arches in 1949, inspiring and leading the effort that resulted in Canyonlands National Park being established in 1964. He is regarded by many as the \"Father of Canyonlands.\"   Bates Wilson firmly believed that:  The park visitor must have a great experience; Exploratory and educational opportunities must abound; Preservation is our obligation to future generations; and that Youth indeed are the future: Bates enhanced the lives of countless young people as they explored and learned to appreciate the parks with him.
