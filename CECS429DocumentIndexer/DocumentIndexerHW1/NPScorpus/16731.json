    "body": "Clarendon County, South Carolina       In Clarendon County, the State NAACP first attempted, unsuccessfully and with a single plaintiff, to take legal action in 1947 against the inferior conditions African American students experienced under South Carolina’s racially segregated school system. By 1951, community activist Rev. J.A. DeLaine, convinced African American parents to join the NAACP efforts to file a class action suit in U.S. District Court. The U.S. District Court found that the schools designated for African Americans were grossly inadequate in terms of buildings, transportation and teachers' salaries when compared to the schools provided for whites. An order to equalize the facilities was virtually ignored by school officials and the schools were never made equal. This class action case was named for Harry Briggs, Sr. Information courtesy of the Brown Foundation for Educational Equity, Excellence and Research.        Summerton High School   National Register of Historic Places designation On August 26, 1994, Summerton High School was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its significance to the Brown v.
