Fire is essential for the health of Glacier's ecosystem, as it maintains a natural balance and mix of plants and trees that in turn contributes to a diversity of wildlife. Fire reduces woody material to ash and releases nutrients. It also reduces build-up of deadfall and organic material, which may lessen the intensity of future fires. There is a natural succession of growth, death, and restoration that depends on fire.              Current Fire Information   Find out what is happening at the park and nationwide.
