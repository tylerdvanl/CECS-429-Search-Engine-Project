NPS Photo \/ Anne Finney   Â    THANK YOU Your interest in making a donation to Denali National Park and Preserve is deeply appreciated.  You can make a gift to benefit the park either directly to the National Park Service or to our primary non-profit, tax exempt partner, Alaska Geographic.  If you make the gift directly to Denali, your donation will be used for interpretation, research and enhancing visitor experiences.  No administrative costs are deducted from your gift, when given directly to the National Park Service for use in Denali. Your check will be deposited in a government account. Government accounts are non-interest bearing. To give directly to Denali National Park & Preserve, please mail your check to:  Superintendent Denali National Park and Preserve PO Box 9, Denali Park, AK 99755  The advantage of making your donation to Alaska Geographic is that the amount will be deposited in an interest-bearing account to assist projects or programs as requested and prioritized by Denali's managers.
