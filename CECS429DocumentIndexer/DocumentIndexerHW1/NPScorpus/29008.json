    "body": "Scenic Vistas         A view from the beach at Sagamore Hill National Historic Site. NPS  At the time that Theodore Roosevelt first visited the site that would be his Sagamore Hill home, the area was under cultivation as a hayfield and orchard. Rising some 170 feet above sea level, it possessed broad views of Oyster Bay to the west and across Long Island Sound toward Greenwich, Connecticut to the north.   Over the years, as Roosevelt sold portions of his acreage between his home and Oyster Bay and as other neighbors took cultivated lands out of production, the original views were replaced by woodland landscapes. Beautiful views of the sound can still be had, however, by visiting the boardwalk that traverses the siteâ€™s salt marsh and beach complex.",
