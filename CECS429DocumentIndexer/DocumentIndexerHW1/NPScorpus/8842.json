Along its 42 miles of Lake Superior shoreline are over 15 miles of towering sandstone cliffs, more than 12 miles of beautiful beaches, and nearly five miles of enormous sand dunes. And there are waterfalls, lighthouses, lakes, streams, and forest to enjoy.  Many attractions are accessible either by automobile or by short footpaths. Hikes can be as short as 100 feet or as long as nine miles. Only your enthusiasm and energy will limit your distance.             Visitor Centers Passport Stamps            Maritime Sites             Scenic Sites             Waterfalls             Beaver Basin Wilderness            Drive-in Campgrounds        Return to top of page",
