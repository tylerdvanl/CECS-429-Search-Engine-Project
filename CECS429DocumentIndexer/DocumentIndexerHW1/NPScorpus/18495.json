    "body": "Canal Workers       \"Who worked along the C&O Canal?\" Well, that's a mighty long list and an imprecise one at that, what with spelling errors, copy errors, faulty memories and all. But here are a few people we think we know about, associated with their professions and approximate eras. IMPORTANT NOTES TO CATALOGUERS: Entries must be consistent if this document is to remain searchable. Therefore, when indicating years, all four numerals must be entered (e.g., \"2001\", NOT \"01\" or other variants). If a person is associated with more than one numbered boat, lock, level, dam, etc. each number must be listed separately and be preceded by a \"#\" sign (e.g., \"#1, #2, #3, #4\", NOT \"#1-4\" or other variants). Locks associated with \"Locktenders\" are lift locks unless noted otherwise. The following are standard terms for this document:    African-American Gardener Outlet Lock   Baker General Manager Owner   Blacksmith General Superintendent Paymaster   Boatman Gold Miner Quarryman   Boat Builder Grocer Registrar   Boat Owner Guard Lock Restaurateur   Captain Hotelier Stonecutter   Canaller Child (>age 7) Laborer Storekeeper   Clerk Levelwalker Supervisor   Concessionaire Leather Finisher Superintendent   Cook Lock House Timekeeper   Carpenter Locktender Ticket Taker   Dam Missionary Tide Lock   Division Superintendent Mr. Watchman   Fisherman Mrs.    Foreman Mule Tender          Adams, A.S., Locktender (#33), c.1840s Grove, B.?, Locktender (#34), 1920s Price, George (Corky), Captain (#1), c.1900-1923   Allnutt, Fred, Grocer (on River Road near Lock 22), c.1900-1924 Grove, Bill, Boatman, c.1890-1920 Price, Leiper, Captain (#36), c.1900-1923   Anderson, Will, Restaurateur, Great Falls, c.1915 Grove, Boogie, Boatman, c.1915-1923 Pryor, Frank, Captain, Boatman, c.1910-1923   Apple, Mr., Locktender (#56?, #57?), Stonecutter, c.1900 Grove, Clyde, Captain (#15), Boatman, c.1890-1920 Pryor, Genevieve, Boatman, Boatman, c.1910-1923   Apple, Tom, Boatman, c.1910-1923 Grove, Oliver, Captain (#5, #15), c.1900-1923 Pryor, Harry, Captain (#3, #69), c.1890-1923   Atwell, Sam, Captain (#35), c.1900-1923 Grove, Otho (Otha?), Captain (#7), Boatman, c.1890-1920 Pryor, Hazel, Boatman, c.1910-1923   Aud, Asa, Locktender (#25 and Edwards Ferry Outlet Locks), 1840s Gwyn, Joseph, Locktender (#39), 1839-1840 Randolph, Robert, Locktender (#58), early 1900s [son Foy drowned in canal at age 9 or 10]   Ault, John W., Locktender (#36 and Guard Lock at Dam 3), c.1920s Hall, Adam, Locktender (#34), 1856 Redden, Jean (a.k.a.
