    "body": "Explore This Park    Learn About the Park     Management     Freedom Of Information Act              Freedom Of Information Act       The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a federal law that gives you the right to access any Point Reyes National Seashore, National Park Service (NPS), or Department of the Interior (DOI) records unless DOI reasonably foresees that the release of the information in those records would harm an interest protected by one or more of the nine exemptions (reasons an agency may withhold records from a requester) or release is prohibited by law. If you are seeking general information about Point Reyes National Seashore, you may wish to explore other pages of this website or feel free to contact the park. The information you are seeking may already be available on the Internet (check out our Reading Room which includes responses to previous FOIA Requests and Other Documents of Interest), at park Visitor Centers, or by simply calling 415-464-5100, mailing, or e-mailing your request to the park. If it is not, you will need to submit a written FOIA request (there is no official request form, just send us a letter describing the records you desire) to:  Superintendent Point Reyes National Seashore 1 Bear Valley Road Point Reyes Station, CA 94956  You may also submit FOIA requests to the NPS or the DOI. If you have questions on what information is available without submitting a FOIA request or where it may be located, contact one of the NPS FOIA Officers and Contacts or DOI FOIA Contacts. Our responsibility is to provide you with copies of the documents you are entitled to receive under the law. We want to work with you to achieve that goal.
