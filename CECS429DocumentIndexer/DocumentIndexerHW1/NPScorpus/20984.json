The scrubland on Point Loma includes four community types: southern coastal bluff scrub, maritime succulent scrub, Diegan coastal sage scrub, and southern maritime chaparral. These communities are home to a variety of plant species such as snake cholla, prickly pear cactus, Mojave yucca, Shaw’s agave, California coast poppy, Indian paintbrush, California buckwheat, California sagebrush, and lemonadeberry. These plant communities make up the coastal Mediterranean ecosystem.
