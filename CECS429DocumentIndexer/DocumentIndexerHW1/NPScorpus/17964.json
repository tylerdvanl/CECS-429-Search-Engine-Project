Please have patience as we continue to upload information. For any questions, comments, or advice on what you think would make our Virtual Tour program better, contact the webteam. For some people who may be interested in the history of Fort Smith National Historic Site but live too far away for a practical visit may find some semblance of \"being there\" by taking one or more of our virtual tours. The tours are broken up into two main sections - the Grounds and inside the Visitors' Center.  Â     Aerial view of Fort Smith National Historic Site. NPS Photo",
