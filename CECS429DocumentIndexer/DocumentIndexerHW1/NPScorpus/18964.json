They might easily forget that Mr. Lincolnâ€™s neighborhood is in the midst of a busy urban environment.  The trees and shrubs may subdue the sounds of the city, but the cacophony of urban noise is always present at Lincoln Home.  Adjacent to the site are a fire station, railroad track, and urban traffic.   Fire engine sirens, train whistles, diesel trucks, buses, and lawn mowing equipment are part of the ambient noise of a 21st century city.",
