More than half of these miles are protected within two areas administered directly by the National Park Service and three areas are supported through partnerships with the National Park Service. For more information, please link to their websites from this page.      Upper Delaware Scenic & Recreational River A 73-mile stretch of free-flowing river with abundant whitewater that forms the boundary between Pennsylvania and New York north of Interstate 84. Of these 73 miles, 1\/3 are designated as a national scenic river of the National Wild & Scenic Rivers System, and 2\/3 are designated as a recreational river.The river itself is the park. Except for some land at the Roebling aqueduct and the home of Zane Grey, almost all of the riverbanks are privately owned.      Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area The recreation area encompasses the 40 miles of the Middle Delaware River and 67,000 acres of river valley in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. This part of the river is calm, passing cliffs, fields and forest.

The Middle Delaware River is part of the Delaware River Water Trail, a unit of the National Recreation Trails Program.      Delaware & Lehigh National Heritage Corridor The Corridor encompasses sections of the Delaware River near Easton, PA, and of the Lehigh River from Easton, PA inland to mining country and to Lehigh Gorge, PA.
