    "body": "Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit     Accessibility     Service Animals              Service Animals       Service animals are allowed in National Parks. For a definition of a service animal, please go to www.ada.gov\/service_animals_2010.htm.   Anywhere that you wish to go, your service animal may go, too. There are some unique aspects of visiting this park to keep in mind, however.   ● Water: There is a water fountain outside and to the rear of the Visitor Center. While there is a creek on the nature trail in the park, be aware that water-born diseases like giardia could be present.   ● Terrain: Park trails are generally surfaced with compacted gravel or a mix of native soils and rocks.   ● Waste: Every rest area and visitor center throughout the park has trash cans for disposing of animal waste;however, there are no plastic bags provided, so please remember to bring your own.   ● Wildlife: Wildlife can be encountered anywhere in the park - even near developed and busy areas, like the visitor center. Deer, bear and smaller animals like foxes, coyotes and even squirrels could cause issues for service animals unused to encountering wildlife.   ● Farm Animals: Please be respectful of our farm animals and their environment. Ducks and chickens roam free during the day and only rail fencing separates our sheep, horse and cow.",
