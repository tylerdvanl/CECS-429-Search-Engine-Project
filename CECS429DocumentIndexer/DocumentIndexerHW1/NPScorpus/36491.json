    "body": "Community Artist in the Parks Program       The Community Artist in the Parks program began in 2009 as a way to highlight the connection between local artists and the landscapes contained within the National Park Service Southeast Utah Group (SEUG): Arches and Canyonlands National Parks and Hovenweep and Natural Bridges National Monuments.  The program gives visitors from across the globe an opportunity to see first-hand the results of artistic inspiration from wild nature. It provides local artists an ability to teach and demonstrate their medium and passion for creative expression. Interested?
