NPS\/Case Griffing  Bring Your Leashed Pet on the Trail! Due to the extreme temperatures experienced in the park, dogs are welcome on the trails at both Montezuma Castle and Montezuma Well. If you visit during the summer months, please do not leave your dog in your parked vehicle. Even with the windows rolled down slightly, temperatures inside a locked car can climb to over 140 degrees! However, all dogs must remain on a leash (no longer than 6 feet) and under control at all times. Pet owners are required to clean up after their dogs and prevent them from harming park plants and wildlife. Dogs are not allowed inside the visitor center at Montezuma Castle.",
