    "body": "Be a Junior Ranger       What is a Junior Ranger? Junior Rangers help to preserve and protect national parks. They learn about nature and history, have fun exploring the parks, and tell their friends, families, and schoolmates about their adventures. Junior Rangers continue to protect the environment at home and at school. How can you become a Junior Ranger?  Based on what part of the canyon you visit, pick up one of the Junior Ranger Books described below. Complete the activity requirements within the book and bring it back to a visitor center before you leave the park. All Junior Ranger programs are free of charge.         South Rim Junior Rangers (Ages 4 and up) To become a Junior Ranger at the South Rim, pick up the South Rim Junior Ranger Activity Book at the Grand Canyon Visitor Center, Verkamp's Visitor Center Park Headquarters, or Tusayan Museum near Desert View. Complete the requirements listed in the booklet for your age group. Requirements include attending a ranger-led program, writing your observations, drawing pictures, and creating poems.

When you have completed the activities in the booklet, bring it to the Phantom Ranch Ranger Station to earn your badge, certificate, and free patch.  Did you know that the Grand Canyon Pink Rattlesnake (Crotalus oreganus abyssus) is found only in the Grand Canyon? The Phantom Rattler Junior Ranger patch, with a pink rattlesnake, is a special patch that can only be earned by Junior Rangers who hike or ride the mules to Phantom Ranch, at the bottom of Grand Canyon.   The Phantom Rattler program is available throughout the year.         What to do when you finish your activities: Bring your completed booklet to a Visitor Center for review by a ranger. You will take a pledge and receive an official Grand Canyon Junior Ranger badge. If you bring your certificate to one of our park's non-profit book stores, you can purchase a custom sew-on patch to go with the award you received.      Questions about our Junior Ranger program?
