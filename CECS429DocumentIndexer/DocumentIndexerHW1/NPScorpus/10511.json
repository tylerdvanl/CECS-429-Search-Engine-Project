    "body": "General Management Plan Environmental Impact Statement       An environmental impact statement (EIS) was prepared for the park general management plan. On October 17, 2005, the NPS Northeast Regional Director concluded the general management planning and environmental analysis by signing a record of decision. The Notice of Availability of the record of decision for the final EIS for the Boston Harbor Islands General Management Plan was published in the Federal Register on November 14, 2005 (Vol. 70, No. 218). Because public and agency comments did not substantially modify any of the alternatives or the environmental analysis in the draft EIS, the full text of the draft has not been reprinted. Rather, an abbreviated format was used for the final EIS. The final EIS consists of the draft plus the errata. ABSTRACT The proposals presented and analyzed establish concepts for possible future management directions for Boston Harbor Islands national park area, consistent with National Park Service policies. The alternatives make clear that adoption of the plan will not result in changes to the resources so much as it will set policy-level direction for future decisions to be made by the diverse agencies that cooperatively manage the park. The primary action of the general management plan is to designate specific “management areas” for each area of the park. These geographic areas prescribe broad direction for resource management, visitor use, and development of park facilities. The approach taken is general; the plan is not detailed, specific, or technical in nature, nor are there detailed or site-specific proposals to analyze. The plan calls for additional environmental analysis when specific actions are proposed in the park. Public and agency review and comment did not result in substantial modifications to any of the alternatives or the environmental analysis presented in the draft environmental impact statement, so an abbreviated format is used for the final.         General Management Plan Final Environmental Impact Statement Because public and agency comments did not substantially modify any of the alternatives or the environmental analysis in the draft EIS, the full text of the draft has not been reprinted.
