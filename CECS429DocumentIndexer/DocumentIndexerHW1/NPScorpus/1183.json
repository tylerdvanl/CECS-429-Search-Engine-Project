Sixty mountain peaks over 12,000 feet high result in world-renowned scenery. The Continental Divide runs north - south through the park, and marks a climatic division. Ancient glaciers carved the topography into an amazing range of ecological zones. What you see within short distances at Rocky is similar to the wider landscape changes seen on a drive from Denver to northern Alaska.         Montane  (5,600-9,500 feet) Large meadow valleys and slopes support the widest range of life.
