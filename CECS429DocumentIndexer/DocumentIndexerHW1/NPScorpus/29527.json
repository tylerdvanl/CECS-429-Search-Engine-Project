Underground Railroad Connections with the First Women's Rights Convention The five women organizers of the First Women’s Rights Convention were all self-identified abolitionists. They were either married to prominent abolitionist leaders or worked in leadership roles of female anti-slavery societies. The national leaders and philosophers of the abolition movement were their personal friends. All of the organizers had knowledge of the Underground Railroad. This exhibit explores the connections between the Underground Railroad and the lives of these women abolitionists. It provides a greater understanding of why they would tap into the Underground Railroad network to find support for the new women’s rights movement that they began in Seneca Falls.  Underground Road?
