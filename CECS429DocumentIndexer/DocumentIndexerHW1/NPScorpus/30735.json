Good planning and preparation will make your visit enjoyable and rewarding. Summer months can be extremely hot and humid, with occasional and sudden severe thunderstorms. Fall and spring are pleasant with cool temperatures and brisk winds. During the Winter the Memorial and Visitor Center are closed. However, starting Winter of 2014-2015 the Administration Office severed as a Winter Visitor Center for visitors. Sensible seasonal dress is recommended for your visit and depending on your planned activities, should include accessories such as sunscreen, and extra water. All emergencies in the park should be addressed to 911. Poisonous plants and encounters with wildlife do occasional occur in the park. Animals to be cautious of are Red Wing Black Birds during nesting season, and the Lake Erie Water Snake, which is not poisonous but if provoked they can be aggressive. Firearms in National Parks: Federal law governing possession of firearms inside a national park changed on February 22, 2010. Visitors may possess firearms within a national park unit provided they comply with federal, state, and local laws. The role of the responsible gun owner is to know and obey the federal, state, and local laws appropriate to the park they are visiting. Please remember that federal law prohibits firearms in certain park facilities and buildings. These places are marked with signs at public entrances.
