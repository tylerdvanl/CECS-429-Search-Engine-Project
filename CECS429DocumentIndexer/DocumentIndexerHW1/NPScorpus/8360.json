    "body": "Personal Watercraft       Personal watercraft, also known as PWCs or by their model names of JetSki, SeaDoo, or WaveRunner, are allowed to operate on the waters of the State of North Carolina under special regulations. Know the rules before you ride -- before putting your PWC in the water, read and understand the NC Personal Watercraft Laws. These laws are online at the North Carolina Wildlife and Resources Commission website. Beginning September 8, 2006, PWCs will be allowed to land at 10 locations on the sound-side beaches of North Core Banks, South Core Banks and Shackleford Banks. When landing at these locations, PWC operators must observe flat wake speed and come straight in to shore or go straight out past the park's boundary. These areas are for landing only, all other riding must take place outside the park's boundaries.    Â       There are 10 areas on the soundside where PWCs may land.  Be sure to check the access map (pdf - 530 kb) before riding out to the banks.",
