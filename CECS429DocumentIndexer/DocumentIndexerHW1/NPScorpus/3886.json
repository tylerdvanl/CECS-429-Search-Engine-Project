Our workshops familiarize new teachers with program opportunities, logistics, and safety considerations. Additionally, workshops set the stage for pre-visit and post-visit classroom activities that allow teachers to provide their students with much more than simply a trip to the park. While not guaranteed, continuing education credit is usually available. Workshops are typically scheduled on Miami-Dade County teacher work days.      Shark Valley Day Program Workshop(for 4th grade teachers) Monday, November 8, 2016Monday, January 23, 2017Royal Palm Day Program Workshop(for 5th and 6th grade teachers)Monday, November 8, 2016Monday, January 23, 2017Loop Road Camping Program Workshop(for 5th and 6th grade teachers)Saturday & Sunday, December 10 - 11, 2016Hidden Lake Camping Program Workshop(for 5th and 6th grade teachers)Saturday & Sunday, December 10 - 11, 2016        If you plan to register your class for a ranger-led program, you can sign up for the corresponding workshop at the same time. You can attend the workshops even if you are not planning to bring students to the park this year. To register for any of these without a scheduled program, e-mail us with your name, school, grade level, phone number, and which workshop. If you registered online for a ranger-led program and requested a workshop, you do not need to send a separate email.",
