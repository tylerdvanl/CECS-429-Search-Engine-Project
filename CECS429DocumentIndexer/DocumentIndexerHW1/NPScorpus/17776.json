John Muir National Historic Site has many types of volunteer positions. Interpretive volunteers answer visitor questions and present public interpretive and educational programs. Positions are available in our Visitor Center and the historic Muir House. Commitments to these volunteer positions are for one year.   Garden and landscape volunteers assist with manual labor in the park's fruit\/nut orchards and the Mt. Wanda open space areas. Duties include pruning fruit trees and ornamental shrubs; digging, planting and weeding around historic structures; hauling brush & debris to compost piles; spreading mulch; picking ripe fruits\/nuts. These positions are ongoing and there is no minimum commitment requirement. Volunteers with back, heart, allergies or other medical conditions are advised that this is physically demanding work in the outdoors. Biological Interns support the natural resources management program. Interns assist the park biologist in natural resource management projects and inventory and monitoring activities. They help collect field data, remove non-native and invasive plant species and assist with native plant restoration efforts. Interns are required to work at least 10 hours per month for a minimum of 4 months. If you are interested in being part of our Volunteers In Parks (VIP) corps, please contact us at 925-228-8860.",
