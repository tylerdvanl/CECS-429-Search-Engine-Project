    "body": "Collections       Did you know that the C&O Canal National Historical Park has a museum collection? While the collection itself is too large to display at one time, selected objects of interest are always on display at various visitor centers around the park.   An important component of the park's purpose is to preserve and interpret the canal. The museum collection provides a way to learn about the canal's history through its artifacts. When visiting the park, come to one of the Visitor Centers to see the current exhibit.",
