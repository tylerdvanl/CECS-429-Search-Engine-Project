The existing landscape is historic and the buildings of the settlement were built before current accessibility standards were set.  The National Park Service strives to make the park as universally accessible as possible. However, extra obstacles will be encountered because of the nature of this special place.  Visitors using wheelchairs or who have visual impairments may need assistance.",
