UCF School of Visual Art & Design  The Turtle Nest Cam project is a partnership between the National Park Service's Canaveral National Seashore and the University of Central Florida's School of Visual Art and Design. Waiting for sea turtle hatchlings to emerge from a nest can be a bit like scanning the skies for a shooting star. It might not happen at all that night, or take hours before those tiny flippers start shifting the grains of sand, but at least now thousands of web viewers can sit back in the comfort of wherever they might be and wait until they do.
