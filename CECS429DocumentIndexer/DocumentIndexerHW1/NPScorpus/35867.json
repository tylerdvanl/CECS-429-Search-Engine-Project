    "body": "Antelope Creek Village Site         Petroglyph near the ruins NPS  The Antelope Creek people lived in a small village next to a spring about a mile from the quarry sites. The walls of their residences were built with one or two rows of dolomite along the base. When two rows of dolomite were used, rubble was placed between the two rows, probably for insulation. Wattle and daub or stone was used for the higher sections of the wall. The roof was probably made of thatched grasses. The entrance to the home was a long, low crawlway, which probably afforded some protection from animals and hostile people, and may also have allowed more airflow through the structure. Two low benches along each side of the interior were probably used for sleeping areas. A fire pit was located in the center of the room, which would have required a hole in the ceiling to let the smoke out. Shards of Alibates flint are found on the ground around the Antelope Creek village near the quarries.  These people also carved a series of petroglyphs into the dolomite boulders near their dwellings. Turtles, footprints, cupules and other shapes can be found on several boulders. You can read more about these fascinating artifacts and view pictures on our Petroglyphs page. Ranger-led tours to the ruins are given to the village on weekends in October.
