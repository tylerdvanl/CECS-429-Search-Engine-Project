It is a non-profit corporation with IRS 501(c) (3) status. Foundation members support the efforts of the National Park Service at Wilson's Creek National Battlefield with yearly membership donations to the Foundation, additional financial pledges, and volunteer involvement.  Membership is open to both individuals and corporations. Since the Foundation's initial purchase of 37 acres on Bloody Hill, site of the heaviest fighting during the battle, the Foundation has worked to preserve and protect the park. The goal of the Foundation is to enhance awareness and appreciation of this national treasure-a haven for historians and those who enjoy the outdoors.  Equally important to Wilson's Creek is the Foundation's function as the fundraising arm of the park. National Park Service policy prohibits park personnel from being actively involved in fundraising. Through memberships and other donations, the Foundation works to provide funds for projects that are not covered by the park's federal budget. Past projects supported by the Wilson's Creek National Battlefield Foundation include:   Construction of a picnic pavilion Furnishings for the Ray House  Purchase of cannon carriages  Video system for the park Visitor Center  Acquisition of John K. and Ruth L. Hulston library collection  130th anniversary reenactment of the battle  Restoration of the Edwards Cabin  The new library annex and education center (adjacent to the Wilson's Creek Visitor Center), opened in April 2003 and was built with funds raised by the Foundation and a matching government grant. Future projects of the Foundation include:  Purchase and placement of additional cannon carriages  Establishment of an endowment fund to continue the work of the Foundation  Please become a member and help us as we continue to fight the battle for Wilson's Creek!
