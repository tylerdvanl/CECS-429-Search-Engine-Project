To become a Haleakalā Junior Ranger, families may request the free, full-color Junior Ranger booklet at any visitor center or print it out at home.  After reviewing their work with a ranger at any visitor center or mailing it in, participants are awarded an official Junior Ranger badge. Modeled after the National Park Service badge, Haleakalā Junior Ranger badges are shaped like an arrowhead and feature a native Hawaiian Honeycreeper.
