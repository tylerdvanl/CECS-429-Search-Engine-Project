NPS.          What makes the cabin camps historic? Four of the five cabin camps in Prince William Forest Park are listed on the National Register of Hisoric Places. Each camp is composed of group of wood, stone, and brick structures constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps and Works Progress Administration workers of the Great Depression. The camps were built as summer camps that the government hoped would instill the poor children of Washington, DC with the 'character and health-building' benefits of the great outdoors. In World War II, the camps were used by the Office of Strategic Services as a spy training area.         Cabin Camp One Camp One was the first camp completed by the CCC. It sleeps 151 visitors. Its dining hall and craft lodges are some of the best examples of rustic architecture in the park. Stone foundations and fireplaces and whole log supports showcase the beautiful native materials used by the CCC in construction. The sleeping cabins in this camp are newer construction (circa 1980s) and some are even handicapped-accessible.

This camp mainly contains 4 person cabins, with a few two and 6 person cabins mixed in here and there. The large ballfield and lake access in Camp 2 is one of the best in the park. This camp sleeps 148 visitors. Learn more about Cabin Camp Two.         Cabin Camp Three With a 76-person capacity, this camp has the smallest capacity of all park cabin camps. Though the camp may hold less people, its 10-person cabins make it one of the best in the park for group outings. Also, the beautiful brick fireplaces in the dining hall and craft lodges give this camp a unique character.

The 199 visitors who can sleep in this camp can enjoy the new roofs and windows that will help ensure that these historic structures last for future generations. Camp Four has mostly 10-person sleeping cabins. While this camp is the only one without a fireplace in its dining hall, the theatre building\/gymnasium in the camp is the only one in the park.

The camp offers the largest capacity (212 in summer, 104 in winter) due to the large dorm buildings and bathrooms. This is also the only camp with heat which allows this camp to be rented year round. This is also the only camp to have an outdoor picnic pavilion located inside the camp.
