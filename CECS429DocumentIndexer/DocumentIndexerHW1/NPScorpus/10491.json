    "body": "Island Facts: What's in a name?       Over the centuries the names of some islands in Boston Harbor have changed. We use the island names—and standard spellings—adopted by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. Like many proper names, these official spellings may not conform with rules that apply to other words. For instance, possessive apostrophes are rarely used. Alternate island names (and Harbor islands not within the park) are listed below.          • Apple Island • Apthorps Island• Bare Island • Beacon Island • Belle Isle • Bird Island • Bomkin Island • Bumkin Island • Castle Island • Gallups Island • Governors Island • Greater Brewster • Half Moon Island • Haymans Island • Hoffs Thumb • Hog Island • Hogg Island (now Spinnaker) • Hogg Island (now part of East Boston) • Hogg Island (unknown) • Houghs Thumb • House Island • Light House • Light-house • Lighthouse Island • Little Hog • Nicks Mate • Nixes Island • Nixs Mate     • Noodle Island • Noddles Island • North Brewster • Outward Island • Pembertons • Peddock • Pedocks • Pethick's • Pettocks • Pettucks • Puttock • Paddocks • Pettick's • Petticks • Round Island (now Bumpkin) • Round Island (now Sheep) • Sailors Island • Sayles's Island • Spinniker Island • Sun Island • Thimble Island • Ward Island (now Bumpkin) • Ward Island (now Spectacle)",
