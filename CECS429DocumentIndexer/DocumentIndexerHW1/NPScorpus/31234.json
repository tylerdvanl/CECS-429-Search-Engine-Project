NPS Photo  Rich In History For at least 13,000 years, a constant stream of people have come to the Canadian River region of the Texas Panhandle, including Native Americans, explorers, soldiers, ranchers, settlers and geologists. Some only stopped here temporarily, others made this their permanent home. Today, this human history is preserved at Lake Meredith National Recreation Area.   Â    Protecting Cultural Resources It is always exciting to discover evidence left behind by earlier people, but in order to preserve our history it is vital that all cultural and historic artifacts remain undisturbed. Please help us preserve these special items. It is illegal to collect them.",
