While camping is available year-round, persons visiting during the wet season (June through November) should be aware of potentially difficult and uncomfortable conditions.  Visitors should also be well-prepared as camping equipment is not available for rent or purchase in the park. Frontcountry CampingThere are two drive-in campgrounds accessible from the Homestead entrance of the park: Long Pine Key Campground and Flamingo Campground.  Both accommodate tents and RV's with a limited number of group sites.  There are no front country campsites anywhere else in Everglades National Park.AccommodationsThere are generally enough single campsites to meet demand in the frontcountry, but reservations are strongly recommended for Flamingo during the busy winter months, especially holidays such as the week between Christmas and New Year and other winter holiday weekends.Both Flamingo and Long Pine Key campgrounds can accommodate tents and RVs. GROUPS -  A limited number of group sites (up to 15 people) are also available. There is only 1 group site at Long Pine Key and that is available on a first-come first-serve basis, larger groups may need to take two sites if the group site is unavailable.  At Flamingo, during the busy season November 20 - April 15 group sites require a reservation.Backcountry CampingThere are a number of ground sites, beach sites, and elevated camping platforms (\"chickees\") available in various locations in the park.  Most sites are accessible by canoe, kayak, or motorboat, though a few may be reached by hikers.  A backcountry permit is required for all wilderness campsites and issued the day before or day of your trip at either the Flamingo or Gulf Coast Visitor Centers or the fee station at the main park entrance in Homestead.Please go to backcountry camping for more details.        NPS Photo   J Roark  Group site at Long Pine Key Campground",
